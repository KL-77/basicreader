            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/review-amds-ryzen-7-9850x3d-is-a-little-faster-and-a-lot-more-power-hungry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD has released three distinct generations of its 3D V-Cache technology, which initially appeared in the Ryzen 7 5800X3D in 2022. The kernel of the idea has remained the same throughout AMD’s efforts: take an existing desktop processor design and graft 64MB of additional L3 cache onto it.

This approach disproportionately helps apps that benefit from more cache, particularly games, and the size of the boost that 3D V-Cache gives to game performance has always been enough to offset any downsides these chips have come with. In the four years since the 5800X3D was released, AMD also has steadily chipped away at those disadvantages, adding more CPU cores, improving power consumption and temperatures, and re-adding the typical Ryzen range of overclocking controls.

AMD’s new Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which launches for $499 starting tomorrow, is the very definition of a mild upgrade. It’s the year-old Ryzen 7 9800X3D but with an extra 400 MHz of turbo boost speed. That’s it. That’s the chip.

But it is mildly interesting that the 9800X3D’s 5.6GHz boost clock is now 100 MHz higher than that of the Ryzen 7 9700X, the chip’s nearest non-V-Cache equivalent. It’s not nearly as interesting as an actual new chip, but it does mean AMD has closed the last major functional gap between the V-Cache and non-V-Cache Ryzen chips (the pricing gap remains; the 9700X currently retails for around $329).

It also means that the 9850X3D behaves more like a 9700X in other ways—differences that likely won’t matter to its target audience but which do distinguish it from being “just a faster 9800X3D.”

The biggest change AMD made to the Ryzen 9000 version of the X3D chips is that the 3D V-Cache is now stacked underneath the CPU silicon rather than on top. This has the benefit of moving the CPU cores closer to your heatsink or AIO loop, making them easier to keep cool.

The 9850X3D remains an eight-core chip based on AMD’s Zen 5 architecture. All eight of those CPU cores have access to the 3D V-Cache, unlike the 12-core and 16-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D. In each of those chips, one of the CPU chiplets has access to the 3D V-Cache and one doesn’t; AMD’s chipset software is responsible for making sure apps run on the type of CPU core that will maximize the app’s performance. AMD’s software is pretty good at this, but it’s not foolproof, which can make the 9800X3D and 9850X3D more appealing and cost-effective options for PCs that will mainly be used for gaming.

The specs in our CPU testbed are the same as they’ve been for a while. We’ll be focused on comparing the 9850X3D to its predecessors, the 5800X3D, 7800X3D, and 9800X3D, as well as the non-V-Cache 7700X and 9700X. We’ll also include numbers from the higher-end 9900X3D and 9950X3D. Intel’s side of the fence will be represented by the Core Ultra 9 285K and the last few generations of Core i9 chips, though Intel has yet to release any chips that are truly performance-competitive with the 3D V-Cache chips in gaming workloads.

Though our testbed continues to rely on DDR5-6000, AMD’s slide deck takes the current (horrible) state of the RAM market into account. While DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400 is generally still the performance sweet spot for all socket AM5 CPUs, AMD notes that game performance between the 9850X3D with DDR5-6000 and the same chip with DDR5-4800 can be as little as 1 to 2 percent. In other words, pair whatever RAM you can find with this chip and don’t worry about it too much.

The first thing to notice about the 9850X3D is that its multi-core performance is essentially indistinguishable from the 9800X3D. If anything, the 9800X3D seems marginally better behaved in our Handbrake video encoding tests, which could come down to anything or nothing—maybe it’s an actual difference between the chips, maybe it’s the silicon lottery, maybe it’s something else. Overall, it’s mostly a wash.

The 9850X3D does improve significantly on the 9800X3D’s single-core performance, closing the gap with both the Ryzen 9900X3D and 9950X3D (both of which have regular Zen 5 cores with no 3D V-Cache) and the 9700X (which has no 3D V-Cache at all).

There’s a world in which AMD can get this extra performance for “free” without changing anything about the architecture or manufacturing process. AMD could have been “binning” silicon lottery winners, or the reliability of the manufacturing process could have improved enough to allow AMD to hit better numbers that weren’t as consistently achievable a year ago.

But it looks like AMD improved the 9850X3D’s single-core performance mainly by making it behave more like a non-X3D chip. The chip’s power consumption while gaming suggests this is more or less what’s happening—the 9850X3D’s CPU package power while gaming is some 25 or 30 W higher than the 9800X3D playing the same games, despite the single-digit-at-best performance improvement (in both our testing and AMD’s advertising).

While the 9850X3D’s power consumption while gaming isn’t wildly out of step with the 9700X’s or the 9950X3D’s, it does make the tiny performance gains on display here hard to get excited about.

And this is on top of the cost trade-off you’re already making when you buy an X3D-series chip. Game performance is always impressive, but you notice those benefits the most in situations where your CPU, not the GPU, is the performance bottleneck.

Most of the time in a gaming PC, that’s only going to be the case when you’re trying to play games at extremely high frame rates at lower resolutions. It’s less useful when trying to play games at 4K or even 1440p, where your graphics card will be the limiter. If you’re building a system around any GPU slower than an RTX 4080 or 5080, going with a regular 9700X and putting the savings toward your GPU (or toward an eye-wateringly expensive RAM kit) will usually be a better use of funds.

The Ryzen 7 9850X3D mostly does what it says it does: It’s a mild speed bump to AMD’s best gaming processor that, in most cases, very slightly extends the company’s performance lead over Intel chips like the Core Ultra 9 285K.

But the vanilla 9800X3D is almost as fast, uses 25 or 30 W less power during gaming (which also results in temperatures that are 10° to 15° Celsius cooler), and is $30 cheaper as of this writing.

As someone who routinely runs his own Ryzen desktop chips in Eco Mode to reduce power consumption and temperatures and hit a more efficient spot on the performance-per-Watt curve, the numbers that the 9850X3D posted in our testing make it seem like an undesirable trade-off, even if you’re in the target market for a fast-as-possible, money’s-no-object, bragging-rights gaming PC.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/the-origin-story-of-syphilis-goes-back-far-longer-than-we-thought/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When King Charles VIII of France occupied Naples in 1495, his army of nearly 20,000 mercenaries became the ground zero of the “Great Pox,” the first massive venereal syphilis pandemic in Europe, which went on to cause up to 5 million deaths. For a long time, the siege of Naples was considered the first time syphilis entered European accounts and culture. “But the evolutionary history of Treponema pallidum, the lineage of bacteria including the one that causes syphilis, goes way deeper in time,” says Elizabeth Nelson, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University.

Nelson and her colleagues found a 5,500-year-old Treponema pallidum genome in an individual excavated from a rock shelter in Colombia—a discovery that shows pathogens causing treponemal diseases like syphilis, bejel, or yaws are several millennia older than we thought. And this means we might have been thinking about the origins of syphilis in an entirely wrong way.

While the French occupation of Naples did not introduce syphilis to the world, it created the perfect storm that shaped the perception of this disease and its origins for centuries to come. The first ingredient of this storm was the French army and its leader. Charles VIII invaded Naples with a vast melting pot of brigands and mercenaries from all over Europe, including the French, Swiss, Poles, and Spaniards. The king himself wasn’t exactly the epitome of morality. Chroniclers like Johannes Burckard noted his “fondness of copulation” and reported that, once he’d been with a woman, he “cared no more about her” and immediately sought another partner—a behavior eagerly mirrored by his soldiers.

The second ingredient was the city of Naples, which, in the 15th century, was famous as the center of luxury and sex. When the city surrendered and opened its gates, the invading army spent months on what Joseph Grünpeck, a secretary to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, described as “gluttony, debauchery, and consorting with prostitutes.” This created the ideal set of conditions for syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, to spread massively among the armies. When the mercenaries, incapable of fighting anymore, deserted the infected army and fled to their home countries, the disease rapidly spread across Europe. These conditions also immediately defined the narrative about syphilis in terms of cultural and national blame games.

The Neapolitans called syphilis Morbus Gallicus, which means the French disease. The French returned the favor and called it the Neapolitan disease. The English naturally called it the French Pox, and so on. Ultimately, fingers ended up pointing at a few Spaniards from Charles VIII’s army. They allegedly served as crew members on Columbus’ ships that returned from the New World in 1493, just one year before the siege of Naples started. Syphilis was declared a “gift” Columbus brought to Europe from the Americas, a curse the New World cast upon the old one.

The blame game naturally assumed syphilis must have had a single place of origin, be it Naples, France, Europe, or the Americas. The 5,500-year-old Treponema pallidum genome discovered by Nelson and her colleagues suggests it might not have been the case at all. “I would not say our work makes popular syphilis origin stories irrelevant, but it shows there’s more ecological and evolutionary depth here,” Nelson says.

The discovery was, in a way, a lucky break. The team was sequencing the DNA of an individual excavated from the Tequendama I rock shelter, located in the Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia, as part of a broader research project on the population history of the Americas. The individual in question, labeled TE1-3, was an adult male hunter-gatherer who lived in the Middle Holocene, roughly 5,500 years ago. “We weren’t looking for the origins of syphilis, this wasn’t the main focus of our research,” says Nasreen Broomandkhoshbacht, a geneticist at the University of Vermont and co-author of the study.

Typically, scientists hunting for ancient Treponema genomes look for bones with telltale signs of treponematosis like altered shins or pitted skull lesions. But the skeleton of TE1-3 showed no macroscopic signs of infection. Usually, this would make it a poor candidate for pathogen recovery. However, thanks to the sheer volume of data generated—1.5 billion fragments of genetic material—scientists could detect traces of Treponema pallidum.

Despite the bacterial DNA making up a minuscule portion of the total sequencing data, the team succeeded in reconstructing the ancient pathogen’s genome, and right from the start, it appeared a little bit special. The treponema pallidum lineage today comprises three subspecies responsible for syphilis, bejel, and yaws. “We noticed that the genome we recovered differed from those three much more than they differ from each other,” Broomandkhoshbacht says. That indicates the newly discovered bacterium wasn’t a direct ancestor of modern syphilis, yaws, or bejel. “It was a sister lineage that diverged from all known modern subspecies approximately 13,700 years ago in Late Pleistocene,” says Davide Bozzi, a computational biologist at the University of Lausanne and lead author of the study.

About 13,700 years ago was roughly when humans first started populating South America and rapidly spread around the continent. And, based on this discovery, the bacteria of the Treponema pallidum lineage were already diverse and capable of infecting people by then. This Late Pleistocene divergence, the authors note in their study, hints at the ancient pan-human distribution. Various Treponema pallidum subspecies were probably our fellow travelers spreading globally with the first humans that migrated out of Africa.

But there’s much more we need to learn before the “Columbian” syphilis origin debate is settled.

While the 1495 siege of Naples remains the moment syphilis etched itself into the European psyche as a new and terrifying plague, it was likely just one violent flare-up in a relationship between humans and Treponema pathogens that spans continents and millennia. What we don’t know is when and where the important turning points in this relationship took place.

It’s unclear when and why Treponema pallidum evolved its sexual transmission, so evidently present in the subspecies that caused the outbreak in Naples. It’s also unclear whether the 1495 pandemic was triggered by a newly imported strain or a mutation of a lineage already present in Europe. The team hopes analyzing other ancient pathogen genomes hosted by people from different places on the globe and different social contexts—hunter-gatherers, farmers, city dwellers—will answer at least some of these questions.

The problem is, it’s hard to infer a specific pathogen’s features from ancient genomes. “With the data we have today, we can’t say anything about the virulence of this ancient Treponema pallidum subspecies, about how the symptoms of the disease it caused looked like, or about its mode of transmission,” Bozzi says.

What we do know, however, is that thousands of years ago, the Treponema pallidum lineage was likely way more diverse than it is today. “In the future we’d love to look at broader ecological interactions between humans, animals, the environment, and the pathogens,” says Nelson. “We’d love to explore this diversity further.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An open source AI assistant called Moltbot (formerly “Clawdbot”) recently crossed 69,000 stars on GitHub after a month, making it one of the fastest-growing AI projects of 2026. Created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool lets users run a personal AI assistant and control it through messaging apps they already use. While some say it feels like the AI assistant of the future, running the tool as currently designed comes with serious security risks.

Among the dozens of unofficial AI bot apps that never rise above the fray, Moltbot is perhaps most notable for its proactive communication with the user. The assistant works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It can reach out to users with reminders, alerts, or morning briefings based on calendar events or other triggers. The project has drawn comparisons to Jarvis, the AI assistant from the Iron Man films, for its ability to actively attempt to manage tasks across a user’s digital life.

However, we’ll tell you up front that there are plenty of drawbacks to the still-hobbyist software: While the organizing assistant code runs on a local machine, the tool effectively requires a subscription to Anthropic or OpenAI for model access (or using an API key). Users can run local AI models with the bot, but they are currently less effective at carrying out tasks than the best commercial models. Claude Opus 4.5, which is Anthropic’s flagship large language model (LLM), is a popular choice.

Setting up Moltbot requires configuring a server, managing authentication, and understanding sandboxing for even a slice of security in a system that basically demands access to every facet of your digital life. Heavy use can rack up significant API costs, since agentic systems make many calls behind the scenes and use up a lot of tokens.

We’ve only just begun to try Moltbot ourselves (more on that soon), but we’ve seen plenty of discussions circulating in the AI community about the new assistant. The all-in approach has serious security drawbacks, since it requires access to messaging accounts, API keys, and in some configurations, shell commands. Also, an always-on agent with access to messaging channels and personal systems can quickly expand your attack surface.

Even with all the drawbacks listed above, people are still using Moltbot. MacStories editor Federico Viticci, who spent a week testing the tool, described it as “Claude with hands,” referring to how it connects a large language model (LLM) backend with real-world capabilities like browser control, email management, and file operations.

The project’s documentation describes it as a tool for users who want “a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on.”

According to the project’s GitHub page, Steinberger designed the bot to retain long-term memory and execute commands directly on the user’s system, unlike current web-based chatbots from major AI labs. It’s closer to Claude Code and Codex CLI (which also operate on local files using a cloud AI model), but with more latitude to take local actions on the user’s behalf.

Moltbot stores memory as Markdown files and an SQLite database on the user’s machine. It auto-generates daily notes that log interactions and uses vector search to retrieve relevant context from past conversations. The memory persists across sessions because the bot runs as a background daemon.

Compared to Claude Code, which is session-based, Moltbot runs persistently (24/7) and maintains its stored memory indefinitely. It can reportedly recall what you discussed weeks ago. With Claude Code, when you close it, the conversation context is gone (unless you use CLAUDE.md files for project context).

The project’s rapid rise has not come without complications. On Monday, Anthropic asked Steinberger to change the project’s name due to trademark concerns (since “Clawd” sounds like “Claude”), prompting the rebrand from Clawdbot to Moltbot. “Clawdbot” was originally named after the ASCII art creature that appears when you launch Claude Code on a terminal.

However, the transition enabled bad actors to hijack Steinberger’s old social media and GitHub handles, reports The Register. Crypto scammers launched fake tokens using the project’s name, with one reaching a $16 million market cap before crashing. Steinberger responded on X: “Any project that lists me as a coin owner is a SCAM. No, I will not accept fees. You are actively damaging the project.”

Security researchers have also found vulnerabilities in misconfigured public deployments. Bitdefender reported that exposed dashboards allowed outsiders to view configuration data, retrieve API keys, and browse full conversation histories from private chats.

While there’s plenty of hype about Moltbot right now, be advised that any LLM that has access to your local machine is susceptible to prompt injection attacks that can “trick” the AI model to share your personal data with other people or remote servers. While Moltbot offers a glimpse at what future AI assistants from major vendors might look like, it’s still experimental and not yet ready for users who aren’t comfortable trading today’s AI convenience (such as it is) for major security risks.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/heres-the-story-of-how-japans-h3-rocket-lost-its-cargo-and-just-kept-going/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re in the space business long enough, you learn there are numerous ways a rocket can fail. I’ve written my share of stories about misbehaving rockets and the extensive investigations that usually—but not always—reveal what went wrong.

But I never expected to write this story. Maybe this was a failure of my own imagination. I’m used to writing about engine malfunctions, staging issues, guidance glitches, or structural failures. Last April, Ars reported on the bizarre failure of Firefly Aerospace’s commercial Alpha rocket.

Japan’s H3 rocket found a new way to fail last month, apparently eluding the imaginations of its own designers and engineers.

The H3 is a relatively new vehicle, with last month’s launch marking the eighth flight of Japan’s flagship rocket. The launcher falls on the medium-to-heavy section of the lift spectrum. The eighth H3 rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Island in southern Japan on December 22, local time, carrying a roughly 5-ton navigation satellite into space.

The rocket was supposed to place the Michibiki 5 satellite into an orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above the Earth. Everything was going well until the H3 jettisoned its payload fairing, the two-piece clamshell covering the satellite during launch, nearly four minutes into the flight.

Officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are starting to get a handle on what happened. Agency officials briefed the government ministry overseeing Japan’s space activities last week, and the presentation (in Japanese) was posted on a government website.

The presentation is rich in information, with illustrations, a fault tree analysis, and a graph of in-flight measurements from sensors on the H3 rocket. It offers a treasure trove of detail and data most launch providers decline to release publicly after a rocket malfunction.

Some of the material is difficult to grasp for a non-Japanese speaker unfamiliar with the subtle intricacies of the H3 rocket’s design. What is clear is that something went wrong when the rocket released its payload shroud. Video beamed back from the rocket’s onboard cameras showed a shower of debris surrounding the satellite, which started wobbling and leaning in the moments after fairing separation. Sensors also detected sudden accelerations around the attachment point connecting the spacecraft with the top of the H3 rocket.

At this point in the mission, the H3 rocket was well above the thick lower layers of the atmosphere. Aerodynamic forces were not a significant factor, but the rocket continued accelerating on the power of its two hydrogen-fueled main engines. The Michibiki 5 satellite held on for a little more than a minute, when the H3’s first stage shut down and separated from the rocket’s second stage.

The jolt from staging dislodged the satellite from its mooring atop the rocket. Then, the second stage lit its engine and left the satellite in the dust. A rear-facing camera on the upper stage captured a fleeting view of the satellite falling back to Earth. In the briefing package, Japanese space officials wrote that Michibiki 5 fell into the Pacific Ocean in the same impact zone as the H3’s first stage.

Whatever caused the satellite to break free of the rocket damaged more than its attach fitting. Telemetry data downlinked from the H3 showed a pressure drop in the second stage’s liquid hydrogen tank after separation of the payload fairing.

“A decrease in LH2 tank pressure was confirmed almost simultaneously,” officials wrote. A pressurization valve continued to open to restore pressure to the tank, but the pressure did not recover. “It is highly likely that the satellite mounting structure was damaged due to some factor, and as a result, the pressurization piping was damaged.”

The second stage engine lost 20 percent of its thrust, but it fired long enough to put the rocket into a low-altitude orbit. The rocket’s temporary recovery was likely aided by the absence of its multi-ton payload, meaning it needed a lower impulse to reach orbital velocity. The orbit was too low to sustain, and the second stage of the H3 rocket reentered the atmosphere and burned up within several hours.

Investigators now have a grasp of what happened, but they are still piecing together why. JAXA presented a fault tree analysis to the Japanese science and technology ministry, showing which potential causes engineers have ruled out, and which ones remain under investigation.

The branches of the fault tree still open include the possibility of an impact or collision between part of the payload fairing and the Michibiki 5 satellite or its mounting structure. Engineers continue to probe the possibility that residual strain energy in the connection between the satellite and the rocket was suddenly released at the moment of fairing separation.

The rocket is supposed to vent pressure inside the fairing as it ascends through thinner air and into space. Measurements from the rocket indicate the pressure inside the fairing decreased as expected during the launch. Officials don’t believe this was a factor in the launch failure, but engineers are examining whether the measurements were in error.

The rocket and satellite also carried combustible propellants, high-pressure gases, and pyrotechnics. “While no data indicating leakage of these substances has been confirmed, the possibility that they caused the abnormal acceleration cannot be ruled out at this time,” JAXA said.

So far, the probe has found no evidence that a structural problem with the satellite itself was the root cause of the failure.

With last month’s incident, the H3 rocket has a record of six successful launches in eight flights. The H3’s debut launch in 2023 faltered due to an ignition failure on the rocket’s second stage.

JAXA must complete the latest H3 failure investigation in the coming months to clear the rocket to launch the nation’s Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) mission in a narrow planetary launch window that opens in October. MMX is an exciting robotic mission to land on and retrieve samples from the Martian moon Phobos for return to Earth. MMX’s launch was previously set for 2024, but Japan’s space agency delayed it to this year due to earlier problems with the H3 rocket.</div>

            <h2>Dozens of CDC vaccination databases have been frozen under RFK Jr.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-lets-cdc-vaccination-data-rot-dozens-of-databases-frozen/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly half of the databases that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were updating on a monthly basis have been frozen without notice or explanation, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The study—led by Janet Freilich, a law expert at Boston University, and Jeremy Jacobs, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University—examined the status of all CDC databases, finding a total of 82 that had, as of early 2025, been receiving updates at least monthly. But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation.

Examining the databases’ content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The most common vaccination types included in the out-of-date data were vaccinations against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Two frozen databases included data on all three vaccines. When the researchers checked in on the databases again in December, only one had been updated, leaving 37 still entirely out of date.

The finding stood out given that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a fervent anti-vaccine advocate who has worked for decades to undermine trust in and use of life-saving vaccines.

“Given the vaccine skepticism of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it is concerning that nearly 90 percent of the paused databases related to vaccination surveillance, with additional gaps in respiratory disease monitoring,” Freilich, Jacobs, and their co-authors write in the study.

Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.

In an accompanying editorial, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”

The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be due to the direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.

“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.

Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC, writing: Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-claimed-bugs-blocked-anti-ice-videos-epstein-mentions-experts-call-bs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok wants users to believe that errors blocking uploads of anti-ICE videos or direct messages mentioning Jeffrey Epstein are due to technical errors—not the platform shifting to censor content critical of Donald Trump after he hand-picked the US owners who took over the app last week.

However, experts say that TikTok users’ censorship fears are justified, whether the bugs are to blame or not.

Ioana Literat, an associate professor of technology, media, and learning at Teachers College, Columbia University, has studied TikTok’s politics since the app first shot to popularity in the US in 2018. She told Ars that “users’ fears are absolutely justified” and explained why the “bugs” explanation is “insufficient.”

“Even if these are technical glitches, the pattern of what’s being suppressed reveals something significant,” Literat told Ars. “When your ‘bug’ consistently affects anti-Trump content, Epstein references, and anti-ICE videos, you’re looking at either spectacular coincidence or systems that have been designed—whether intentionally or through embedded biases—to flag and suppress specific political content.”

TikTok users are savvy, Literat noted, and what’s being cast as “paranoia” about the app’s bugs actually stems from their “digital literacy,” she suggested.

“They’ve watched Instagram suppress Palestine content, they’ve seen Twitter’s transformation under Musk, they’ve experienced shadow-banning and algorithmic suppression, including on TikTok prior to this,” Literat said. “So, their pattern recognition isn’t paranoia, but rather digital literacy.”

Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and Internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder, agreed that TikTok’s “bugs” explanation wasn’t enough to address users’ fears. She told CNN that TikTok risks losing users’ trust the longer that errors damage the perception of the app.

“Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler told CNN.

Some users are already choosing to leave TikTok. A quick glance at the TikTok subreddit shows many users grieving while vowing to delete the app, Literat pointed out, though some are reportedly struggling to delete accounts due to technical issues. Even with some users blocked from abandoning their accounts, however, “the daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150 percent in the last five days compared to the last three months,” data analysis firm Sensor Tower told CNN.

A TikTok USDS spokesperson told Ars that US owners have not yet made any changes to the algorithm or content moderation policies. So far, the only changes have been to the US app’s terms of use and privacy policy, which impacted what location data is collected, how ads are targeted, and how AI interactions are monitored.

For TikTok, the top priority appears to be fixing the bugs, which were attributed to a power outage at a US data center. A TikTok USDS spokesperson told NPR that TikTok is also investigating the issue where some users can’t talk about Epstein in DMs.

“We don’t have rules against sharing the name ‘Epstein’ in direct messages and are investigating why some users are experiencing issues,” TikTok’s spokesperson said.

TikTok’s response came after California Governor Gavin Newsom declared on X that “it’s time to investigate” TikTok.

“I am launching a review into whether TikTok is violating state law by censoring Trump-critical content,” Newsom said. His post quote-tweeted an X user who shared a screenshot of the error message TikTok displayed when some users referenced Epstein and joked, “so the agreement for TikTok to sell its US business to GOP-backed investors was finalized a few days ago,” and “now you can’t mention Epstein lmao.”

As of Tuesday afternoon, the results of TikTok’s investigation into the “Epstein” issue were not publicly available, but TikTok may post an update here as technical issues are resolved.

“We’ve made significant progress in recovering our US infrastructure with our US data center partner,” TikTok USDS’s latest statement said. “However, the US user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates.”

For TikTok’s new owners, the tech issues risk confirming fears that Trump wasn’t joking when he said he’d like to see TikTok be tweaked to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Because of this bumpy transition, it seems likely that TikTok will continue to be heavily scrutinized once the USDS joint venture officially starts retraining the app on US data. As the algorithm undergoes tweaks, frequent TikTok users will likely be the first to pick up on subtle changes, especially if content unaligned with their political views suddenly starts appearing in their feeds when it never did before, Literat suggested.

Literat has researched both left- and right-leaning TikTok content. She told Ars that although left-leaning young users have for years loudly used the app to promote progressive views on topics like racial justice, gun reforms, or climate change, TikTok has never leaned one way or the other on the political spectrum.

Consider Christian or tradwife TikTok, Literat suggested, which grew huge platforms on TikTok alongside leftist bubbles advocating for LGBTQ+ rights or Palestine solidarity.

“Political life on TikTok is organized into overlapping sub-communities, each with its own norms, humor, and tolerance for disagreement,” Literat said, adding that “the algorithm creates bubbles, so people experience very different TikToks.”

Literat told Ars that she wasn’t surprised when Trump suggested that TikTok would be better if it were more right-wing. But what concerned her most was the implication that Trump viewed TikTok “as a potential propaganda apparatus” and “a tool for political capture rather than a space for authentic expression and connection.”

“The historical irony is thick: we went from ‘TikTok is dangerous because it’s controlled by the Chinese government and might manipulate American users’ to ‘TikTok should be controlled by American interests and explicitly aligned with a particular political agenda,’” Literat said. “The concern was never really about foreign influence or manipulation per se—it was about who gets to do the influencing.”

David Greene, senior counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fought the TikTok ban law, told Ars that users are justified in feeling concerned. However, technical errors or content moderation mistakes are nearly always the most likely explanations for issues, and there’s no way to know “what’s actually happening.” He noted that lawmakers have shaped how some TikTok users view the app after insisting that they accept that China was influencing the algorithm without providing evidence.

“For years, TikTok users were being told that they just needed to follow these assumptions the government was making about the dangers of TikTok,” Greene said. And “now they’re doing the same thing, making these assumptions that it’s now maybe some content policy is being done either to please the Trump administration or being controlled by it. We conditioned TikTok users to basically to not have trust in the way decisions were made with the app.”

TikTok USDS likely wants to distance itself from Trump’s comments about making the app more MAGA. But new owners have deep ties with Trump, including Larry Ellison, the chief technology officer of Oracle, whom some critics suggest has benefited more than anyone else from Trump’s presidency. Greene noted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a key investor in Silver Lake. Both firms now have a 15 percent stake in the TikTok USDS joint venture, as well as MGX, which also seems to have Trump ties. CNBC reported MGX used the Trump family cryptocurrency, World Liberty Financial, to invest $2 billion in Binance shortly before Trump pardoned Binance’s CEO from money laundering charges, which some viewed as a possible quid pro quo.

Greene said that EFF warned during the Supreme Court fight over the TikTok divest-or-ban law that “all you were doing was substituting concerns for Chinese propaganda, for concerns for US propaganda. That it was highly likely that if you force a sale and the sale is up to the approval of the president, it’s going to be sold to President’s lackeys.”

“I don’t see how it’d be good for users or for democracy, for TikTok to have an editorial policy that would make Trump happy,” Greene said.

If suddenly, the app were tweaked to push more MAGA content into more feeds, young users who are critical of Trump wouldn’t all be brainwashed, Literat said. They would adapt, perhaps eventually finding other apps for activism.

However, TikTok may be hard to leave behind at a time when other popular apps seem to carry their own threats of political suppression, she suggested. Beyond the video-editing features that made TikTok a behemoth of social media, perhaps the biggest sticking point keeping users glued to TikTok is “fundamentally social,” Literat said.

“TikTok is where their communities are, where they’ve built audiences, where the conversations they care about are happening,” Literat said.

Rather than a mass exodus, Literat expects that TikTok’s fate could be “gradual erosion” or “death by a thousand cuts,” as users “likely develop workarounds, shift to other platforms for political content while keeping TikTok for entertainment, or create coded languages and aesthetic strategies to evade detection.”

CNN reported that one TikTok user already found that she could finally post an anti-ICE video after claiming to be a “fashion influencer” and speaking in code throughout the video, which criticized ICE for detaining a 5-year-old named Liam Conejo Ramos.

“Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, which featured “a photo of Liam behind her,” CNN reported. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”

Short-term, Literat thinks that longtime TikTok users experiencing inconsistent moderation will continue testing boundaries, documenting issues, and critiquing the app. That discussion will perhaps chill more speech on the platform, possibly even affecting the overall content mix appearing in feeds.

Long-term, however, TikTok’s changes under US owners “could fundamentally reshape TikTok’s role in political discourse.”

“I wouldn’t be surprised, unfortunately, if it suffers the fate of Twitter/X,” Literat said.

Literat told Ars that her TikTok research was initially sparked by a desire to monitor the “kind of authentic political expression the platform once enabled.” She worries that because user trust is now “damaged,” TikTok will never be the same.

“The tragedy is that TikTok genuinely was a space where young people—especially those from marginalized communities—could shape political conversations in ways that felt authentic and powerful,” Literat said. “I’m sad to say, I think that’s been irretrievably broken.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <div id="article-text">AI tech leaders have a lot to gain from striking fear into the hearts of their investors. By painting the tech as an ultra-powerful force that could easily bring humanity to its knees, the industry is hoping to sell itself as a panacea: a remedy to a situation it had a firm hand in bringing about.

Case in point, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei is back with a 19,000-word essay posted to his blog, arguing that “humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”

In light of that existential danger, Amodei attempted to lay out a framework to “defeat” the risks presented by AI — which, by his own admission, may well be “futile.”

“Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt — a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying — to jolt people awake,” he wrote.

Amodei argued that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023,” citing the risks of major job losses and a “concentration of economic power” and wealth.

However, the incentives to invest in meaningful guardrails simply aren’t there. In his essay, Amodei took a thinly-veiled dig at Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot, which has been swept up in a major controversy over creating nonconsensual sexual images.

“Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,” he wrote.

The CEO also cited the risk of AIs developing dangerous bioweapons or “superior” military weapons. An AI could “go rogue and overpower humanity” or allow countries to “use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries,” leading to the “alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship.”

Amodei lamented that we simply aren’t willing to address these risks head-on, at least right now. In its current race to the bottom, the AI industry finds itself in a “trap,” Amodei argued.

“AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all,” he wrote.

“Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them,” he wrote. “But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries.”

“AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state,” he argued.

As part of a solution, Amodei renewed his calls to deny other countries the resources to build powerful AI. He went as far as to liken the US selling Nvidia AI chips to China to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is ‘winning.&#39;”

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the real risks of advanced AI, a subject that remains heavily debated between realists, skeptics, and proponents of the tech. Critics have pointed out that the existential risks often cited by leaders like Amodei may be overblown, particularly as improvements in the tech appear to be slowing.

We should also consider the greater context of Amodei’s verbose warning. The CEO’s company is looking to close a massive, multibillion-dollar round of funding at a valuation of $350 billion. In other words, Amodei has an enormous financial interest in positioning himself as the solution to the risks he cites in his essay.

            <div id="article-text">Terminally online right wing dorks are falling head over heels for an AI-generated waifu — and setting themselves up to get scammed in the process.

The damsel at the center of all their fawning is “Amelia,” who, we must stress, is not real. Nonetheless, she’s everywhere on places like X, where users ask Elon Musk’s AI Grok to imagine her as a purple-haired British schoolgirl — because of course she is — who’s also the anti-woke rebel of their dreams.

Often proudly displaying a Union Jack, Amelia does things like burn pictures of British PM Keir Starmer and rail against Islam and immigrants. She’s also been shown reading the notoriously racist book “The Turner Diaries” and proudly appearing alongside a sieg heiling comrade, flagrantly betraying white supremacist and neo-Nazi sympathies.

But where did “Amelia” come from? According to reporting from The Guardian, she was initially a spoof of a goth-looking character in a video game called “Pathways.” Funded by the UK government, the game was designed to be a classroom tool for teaching teenagers how to avoid falling into online extremism, but quickly became the target of mockery by far-right figures on social media.

The trend was heavily pushed by an anonymous right-wing account on X starting on January 9, according to an analysis by Peryton Intelligence shared with The Guardian. Since then, “Ameliaposting” has surged from 500 posts per day to over 10,000.

Of course, where there’s right wing outrage involved, there’s a grift. An account roleplaying as Amelia began pushing a new Amelia-branded cryptocurrency called $AMELIAJAK, which was retweeted, and thereby effectively endorsed, by Musk, The Guardian noted. (Musk, it’s worth mentioning, has a documented fondness for AI-generated women, with even his own followers mocking him for openly “gooning to AI anime.”) The meme coin reeks of a scam called a rug pull, in which followers are baited into buying the coin to boost its value, before the founder sells all their assets at a higher price. This causes its value to crash, leaving the duped fans with worthless currency.

Not all meme coins end up as being overt scams, but clearly someone intends to profit off of Amelia’s “fame.” And in any case, the coins’ value often collapses on their own, since they’re propped up by nothing except a fleeting moment of internet virality. Amelia may be out there owning the libs and destroying woke, but she’s also emptying the wallets of many far-right memelords who see her as the imaginary, wildly racist goth girlfriend that they never had — but wish they did.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Braving poor visibility, high winds, and frigid temperatures, a team of researchers has finally established a foothold on Antarctica’s fastest melting glacier.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with the polar expedition — 10 drilling personnel and roughly 17 tons of gear have been safely deposited on top of the Thwaites Glacier on Monday. Their goal is to plant scientific instruments into the rapidly-melting berg over the next few days, in order to observe, and hopefully better understand, its faster-than-expected disintegration.

During a rare break in the weather, the NYT says helicopters airlifted the researchers and their equipment 19 miles to their planned outpost site on top of the glacier. The two helicopters involved flew a dozen total loads of cargo from the icebreaker ship to the camp site, while glacial scientists and engineers erected a small tent city, complete with bathrooms, generators, and a mess hall.

The stakes are high. At worst, experts fear that the destruction of the Thwaites — evocatively known among scientists as the “Doomsday Glacier” — could have catastrophic effects on sea levels and coast lines around the world.

The camp is rudimentary: the bathrooms are described as simple outhouses drilled into the snow, while the dining tent boasts a basic air fryer and bread machine. Most food consists of “low-effort meals,” the NYT explains, like freeze-dried fajita bowls and premade soup that can be warmed up. Still, the team also has a cooler full of frozen meat and veggies, which had to be buried within the snow.

Because the ship that carried the team to Thwaites needs to embark on another trek in just a few weeks, the drilling team will need to vacate the glacier by February 7. Before they do, they hope to deposit monitoring equipment into the ocean water half a mile below their feet.

If they’re successful, scientists will be able to remotely collect temperature data on the ocean waters thought to be contributing to the thinning ice shelf. That data is important for glaciologists, who’ve watched in horror as the Thwaites melted at a rate of two or three times faster than expected over recent years.

“We’re very lucky to be here; we also work very hard to be here,” Scott Polfrey, a mechanical engineer at the British Antarctic Survey told the NYT. “It’s important for everybody here that we do things safely and we come home with hopefully some hard-hitting scientific results that speak about our planet.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No one is surprised that Neom — Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s $1.5 trillion-with-a-t plan to build a futuristic megacity smack dab in the middle of the desert — has turned out to be a disaster. Its centerpiece was supposed to be a towering skyscraper called The Line, over 100 miles in length, that could accommodate millions of people, something that the laws of reality always suggested would be impossible to pull off.

But, according to new reporting from the Financial Times, the saga may yet have a twist in store for us. The Saudi government is now considering drastically downsizing the linear city-skyscraper so it can instead turn Neom into a hub for — we swear we are not kidding — data centers.

It’s a proposal that reeks of a Saudi leadership desperate to find a way out of the multibillion dollar hole it’s dug for itself, as the dysfunctional monarchy rushes to follow what everyone else is doing and cash in on the AI race. But royal insiders briefed on the matter insist that, actually, it’s a testament to how flexible the Saudi government is.

“It shows that the system has a capacity to adjust its goals,” one of the people told the FT.

The pivot was proposed as Riyadh wraps up its year-long review of Neom’s progress, and continues a pattern of belt-tightening across the government’s myriad, exorbitantly expensive investments — which include everything from buying up entire sports leagues and teams to competitive video games. Ostensibly to diversify the country’s oil-dependent economy, they’re now becoming more burdensome as oil prices have been in steady decline, leaving the kingdom’s purportedly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund low on cash.

Jumping on the AI bandwagon, low hanging fruit as it is, could be lucrative for the Saudis. And according to the FT‘s source, Neom’s proximity to the Gulf of Aqaba makes it well suited for hosting data centers, even though seawater cooling is not the norm. “Data centers need water cooling and this is right on the coast so it will have seawater cooling,” the source said. “So it will be a major center for data centers.”

The extent that The Line will be downscaled remains unclear, but it apparently isn’t going away completely. The FT’s source said that architects were already working on redesigning the megastructure into a more “modest” — and radically changed — project.

“The Line will be a totally different concept. It will use the existing infrastructure in a totally different manner,” the person told the FT.

The linear city has been controversial since its conception due to its outrageous scale, exorbitant costs, and the human right abuses suffered by construction workers, with thousands believed to have died while working on the project. Now it could be facing its biggest reality check yet, though Neom has repeatedly denied previous reports suggesting it could be downsized.

As it stands, its fate hinges on the ongoing review, which is slated to finish by or near the end of the first quarter of this year.

            <div id="article-text">While employees at some tech corporations are demanding their executives cancel government contracts on principle, workers at other companies are begging leadership to protect them from government raids and physical violence.

New bombshell reporting from Wired reveals that in the aftermath of the shooting of Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti, it came to light that at least one federal agent had tried to enter Google’s office in Cambridge, Massachusetts last fall.

In a response to internal concerns about what Google’s senior leadership was doing to keep its employees safe, the company’s head of security and risk operations reportedly said that an “officer arrived at reception without notice,” attempting to gain entry. Ultimately, the agent was “not granted entry because they did not have a warrant, and promptly left.”

Google didn’t respond to Wired‘s request for comment. According to the publication’s sources, the company’s core leadership, CEO Sundar Pichai and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, have been internally tight-lipped about Pretti’s killing. That stands in notable contrast to DeepMind’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, who’s taken taken a pointedly vocal stand.

“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote in response to a video of Pretti’s killing at the hands of six Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers over the weekend.

“Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera,” he continued. “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”

The excessive violence suffered by US citizens and non-citizens alike at the hands of ICE agents has put renewed urgency on calls to defund or abolish the agency, which was formed in 2003.

In response to the violence, more than 800 tech workers have signed onto an open letter calling on their companies to cut ties with ICE. At the time of writing, at least 100 of them referenced Google or its parent company, Alphabet, in their signature.

And with nationwide anti-ICE protests intensifying, silence is becoming an increasingly untenable position for tech giants like Google to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year when a swarm of AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company launched with an aim to replace Chrome with features like sidebar assistants and automated tasks. Now, Google is flexing its own AI muscles by adding similar features to Chrome, the world’s largest browser by market share.

While Google had introduced Gemini to Chrome last September, the assistant lived in a floating window. With this update, the company will put its AI helper into a persistent sidebar, so you can ask questions about the current website or other open tabs.

One interesting feature Google demoed to press ahead of today’s launch involved multiple tabs. When you open different tabs from a single webpage, the Gemini sidebar understands them as a context group. This is helpful when you are comparing prices or different products you’re considering purchasing.

Before today, the Gemini in Chrome feature was available only to Windows and MacOS users. With this rollout, the sidebar will be available to Chromebook Plus users as well.

Google is also taking advantage of its newly launched personal intelligence feature, which connects to your Gmail, Search, YouTube, and Google Photos accounts, allowing you to ask questions based on your own data. This feature will roll out in Chrome in the coming months, meaning that you can ask Gemini in the sidebar about things like your family’s schedule, or ask it to draft an email and send it without switching to Gmail.

There’s a new Nano Banana integration coming to Chrome, too, that allows you to modify an existing image with another image or product that you find while browsing.

However, the most ambitious feature is called auto-browse, which aims to handle tasks for you by using your personal information and traversing websites on your behalf. For instance, you can ask the agentic feature to go to a particular website and buy an item for you, and find a discount coupon. The agent will ask for your intervention when performing data-sensitive tasks, such as logging into a website or making a final purchase.

Last year, the company explained that these features would use Chrome’s password manager or saved card details, but said its AI models wouldn’t be exposed to any of these details.

This feature is rolling out initially to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S.

Browser-based agents are finicky and often fail to complete tasks. Google’s demo, just like tons of other AI demos, involved shopping and travel planning. In real-world use cases, agents often don’t get the intent or break during traversing different sites, and that would be a challenge for wider adoption.

The company said that in its early testing, users have used the feature for tasks such as scheduling appointments, filling out tedious online forms, collecting their tax documents, getting quotes for plumbers and electricians, and filing expense reports.

The company said that the Gemini sidebar support and Nano Banana integration are arriving starting today, while the personal intelligence feature will be available in the “coming months.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Creator platform Patreon is taking issue with Apple’s new mandate that forces all creators to move to a subscription billing model, which now has a new transition deadline of November 1, 2026.

While the coming changes will only impact the 4% of creators who are still using Patreon’s legacy billing models, the company’s announcement stressed that Apple’s lack of consistency around its changing terms has made it hard for creators to build healthy, long-term businesses.

What Patreon is referring to is the mandate Apple announced in 2024 around subscription billing changes. It said that Patreon must move all its creators to subscription billing using Apple’s in-app purchase system by November 2025 or else Patreon would risk removal from the App Store. Apple made this decision because Patreon was managing the billing for some percentage of creators’ subscriptions, and the tech giant saw that as skirting its App Store commission structure.

To Apple’s credit, Patreon was given plenty of time to migrate its customers to Apple’s in-app purchases.

The company said it would switch creators to subscription billing in November 2024, and creators could choose whether to increase their subscription prices to cover Apple’s fees. In addition, creators could opt to delay changes until November 2025 if they needed more time. However, they wouldn’t be able to offer subscriptions in the app until they adopted Apple’s in-app purchases.

Last May, Patreon took advantage of newly loosened App Store guidelines resulting from the U.S. court ruling in Epic v. Apple to offer creators the ability to process web payments from links in Patreon’s app. At the time, Patreon told creators that the earlier November 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. This gave creators even more time to decide what to do about their subscription businesses.

The company says now that its decision to pause the transition for its creators may have added to the confusion given that Apple is now reimposing a transition deadline of November 2026.

While Patreon is complying with Apple’s decision, it’s clearly bristling at the idea that the tech giant should have a say in how creators run their businesses.

“We strongly disagree with this decision,” its blog post states.

“Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal – the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months. Over the years, we have proposed multiple tools and features to Apple that we could’ve built to allow creators using legacy billing to transition on their own timelines, with more support added in. Unfortunately, Apple has continually declined them,” it says.

Creators can read more about the transition plan on Patreon’s website. It has also built several tools to support these changes, including a benefit eligibility tool to see who has paid or is scheduled to pay, tier repricing tools, and gifting and discount tools to offer payment flexibility. An option for annual-only memberships will be introduced before November 2026 as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many in the industry think the winners of the AI model market have already been decided: Big Tech will own it (Google, Meta, Microsoft, a bit of Amazon) along with their model makers of choice, largely OpenAI and Anthropic.

But tiny 30-person startup Arcee AI disagrees. The company just released a truly and permanently open (Apache license) general-purpose, foundation model called Trinity, and Arcee claims that at 400B parameters, it is among the largest open-source foundation models ever trained and released by a U.S. company.

Arcee says Trinity compares to Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick 400B, and Z.ai GLM-4.5, a high-performing open-source model from China’s Tsinghua University, according to benchmark tests conducted using base models (very little post training).

Like other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Trinity is geared for coding and multi-step processes like agents. Still, despite its size, it’s not a true SOTA competitor yet because it currently supports only text.

More modes are in the works — a vision model is currently in development, and a speech-to-text version is on the roadmap, CTO Lucas Atkins told TechCrunch (pictured above, on the left). In comparison, Meta’s Llama 4 Maverick is already multi-modal, supporting text and images.

But before adding more AI modes to its roster, Arcee says, it wanted a base LLM that would impress its main target customers: developers and academics. The team particularly wants to woo U.S. companies of all sizes away from choosing open models from China.

“Ultimately, the winners of this game, and the only way to really win over the usage, is to have the best open-weight model,” Atkins said. “To win the hearts and minds of developers, you have to give them the best.”

The benchmarks show that the Trinity base model, currently in preview while more post-training takes place, is largely holding its own and, in some cases, slightly besting Llama on tests of coding and math, common sense, knowledge and reasoning.

The progress Arcee has made so far to become a competitive AI Lab is impressive. The large Trinity model follows two previous small models released in in December: the 26B-parameter Trinity Mini, a fully post-trained reasoning model for tasks ranging from web apps to agents, and the 6B-parameter Trinity Nano, an experimental model designed to push the boundaries of models that are tiny yet chatty.

The kicker is, Arcee trained them all in six months for $20 million total, using 2,048 Nvidia Blackwell B300 GPUs. This out of the roughly $50 million the company has raised so far, said founder and CEO Mark McQuade (pictured above, on the right).

That kind of cash was “a lot for us,” said Atkins, who led the model building effort. Still, he acknowledged that it pales in comparison to how much bigger labs are spending right now.

The six-month timeline “was very calculated,” said Atkins, whose career before LLMs involved building voice agents for cars. “We are a younger startup that’s extremely hungry. We have a tremendous amount of talent and bright young researchers who, when given the opportunity to spend this amount of money and train a model of this size, we trusted that they’d rise to the occasion. And they certainly did, with many sleepless nights, many long hours.”

McQuade, previously an early employee at open-source model marketplace HuggingFace, says Arcee didn’t start out wanting to become a new U.S. AI Lab: The company was originally doing model customization for large enterprise clients like SK Telecom.

“We were only doing post-training. So we would take the great work of others: We would take a Llama model, we would take a Mistral model, we would take a Qwen model that was open source, and we would post-train it to make it better” for a company’s intended use, he said, including doing the reinforcement learning.

But as their client list grew, Atkins said, the need for their own model was becoming a necessity, and McQuade was worried about relying on other companies. At the same time, many of the best open models were coming from China, which U.S. enterprises were leery of, or were barred from using.

It was a nerve-wracking decision. “I think there’s less than 20 companies in the world that have ever pre-trained and released their own model” at the size and level that Arcee was gunning for, McQuade said.

The company started small at first, trying its hand at a tiny, 4.5B model created in partnership with training company DatologyAI. The project’s success then encouraged bigger endeavors.

But if the U.S. already has Llama, why does it need another open weight model? Atkins says by choosing the open source Apache license, the startup is committed to always keeping its models open. This comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year indicated his company might not always make all of its most advanced models open source.

“Llama can be looked at as not truly open source as it uses a Meta-controlled license with commercial and usage caveats,” he says. This has caused some open source organizations to claim that Llama isn’t open source compliant at all.

“Arcee exists because the U.S. needs a permanently open, Apache-licensed, frontier-grade alternative that can actually compete at today’s frontier,” McQuade said.

All Trinity models, large and small, can be downloaded for free. The largest version will be released in three flavors. Trinity Large Preview is a lightly post-trained instruct model, meaning it’s been trained to follow human instructions, not just predict the next word, which gears it for general chat usage. Trinity Large Base is the base model without post-training.

Then we have TrueBase, a model with any instruct data or post training so enterprises or researchers that want to customize it won’t have to unroll any data, rules or assumptions.

Acree AI will eventually offer a hosted version of its general release model for, it says, competitive API pricing. That release is up to six weeks away as the startup continues to improve the model’s reasoning training.

API pricing for Trinity-Mini is $0.045 / $0.15, and there is a rate-limited free tier available, too. Meanwhile, the company still sells post-training and customization options.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is eyeing sometime in June for SpaceX’s blockbuster IPO, according to the Financial Times. The billionaire reportedly wants the offering to coincide with both his birthday (June 28th) and the rare alignment of Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter (which is happening in early June).

Regardless of when it happens, though, SpaceX’s IPO will likely be one of the largest in history: It’s looking to raise at least $50 billion at a $1.5 trillion valuation, per the FT (which also noted that those figures are likely to change).

The company wants more funding as it builds its Starship rocket, aiming to reach Mars. SpaceX is one of the nation’s most valuable private companies, and it last held a secondary sale in December that would give it an $800 billion valuation.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/with-apples-new-creator-studio-pro-ai-is-a-tool-to-aid-creation-not-replace-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Generative AI apps that can create photos, videos, songs, and more are growing in popularity. But with the release of Apple’s new Creator Studio Pro suite, available to the public on Wednesday, the tech giant has approached the addition of AI as a tool that aids in the creator process, but doesn’t attempt to replace it.

Instead, Apple lays out a vision that suggests the productivity suite of the future is the one that focuses on the needs of creators — whether that’s filmmakers, musicians, artists, or anyone else enmeshed in a creative industry of some kind — and empowers them to be more efficient using AI.

It’s tricky to bring AI into the world of creativity, given the backlash and even legal action from creators who are angry about AI models training on their works, then reproducing similar art or creative content in the AI systems’ output.

Apple, however, sees AI as a tool that handles more of the basics and tedious tasks — like generating a slideshow for you to edit from your notes, extracting chord information from a song, searching across hours of video footage for the clip you need, changing the camera angle on your images, and more.

The tools in Creator Studio Pro are not new, but they’ve never been packaged as a subscription product, which is now available at $12.99 per month or $129 per year.

Included in the subscription are Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor for video editing; Logic Pro and Mainstage for music creation; image editing tool Pixelmator Pro; and a set of exclusive features in Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform. The suite also includes the newly launched Pixelmator Pro app for iPad.

While Apple’s traditional productivity software applications haven’t caught up to those from Google and Microsoft, the tech giant has always found more success in the creative fields. And with the addition of AI features, the company likely sees the possibility of making its creative software more accessible to those who aren’t fully professionals – like an indie musician or artist who wants to improve their marketing and sales, those who quickly compile video footage to post on social media, or those who want to create music or art and edit the output.

Whether Apple’s tools are the right ones for the job compared with Adobe products will depend on the user’s specific needs and their familiarity with professional creative tools.

Each tool in the suite has received its own series of upgrades timed with this launch, both AI and otherwise. Notable additions include:

Apple says it will continue to offer its creativity apps as standalone downloads, and existing users will still get updates, including these new features. Meanwhile, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform will remain free apps, but the new, premium features will be locked behind the subscription. It’s an interesting choice to allow users to choose to purchase apps outright, as before, as that differentiates Apple’s offering from others, like Adobe.

In addition, Apple lets users share their apps through Family Sharing with up to five family members, which Adobe doesn’t offer. Users can also cancel their subscription at any time, without penalty. However, Adobe remains a fierce competitor with its expansive and detailed tools, which also run on iOS.

Some of the AI features are powered by Apple Intelligence, like the visual and transcript search in Final Cut Pro, which runs locally on the device. Others involve the use of third parties, like OpenAI, which powers things like advanced image generation, Keynote slides, and presenter notes. Creator Studio’s AI features either are processed on the device or use a private relay to anonymize the traffic. Apple says these protections mean users’ content is kept private and never used for AI training.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/san-francisco-police-department-investigating-zoox-collision-with-a-parked-car/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Francisco Police Department is investigating an accident involving a Zoox autonomous vehicle that crashed into the driver’s side door of a parked car, TechCrunch has learned.

Officers responded to the crash, which occurred at around 2 p.m. local time on January 17 near the intersection of 15th and Mission Streets, according to the department. The Zoox robotaxi was traveling along 15th street when a street ambassador named Jamel Durden opened the driver’s-side door of his 1977 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, according to MissionLocal, which first reported the crash.

Durden’s hand was reportedly smashed during the crash, and the Zoox vehicle suffered damage to its glass doors. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) told TechCrunch the Zoox vehicle was carrying a passenger at the time, which has not been previously reported. That passenger was an employee of Zoox, according to the company, and was not injured, which the SFPD confirmed.

The police department declined to provide TechCrunch with an incident report “[d]ue to the fact it is still an open investigation.” Zoox filed its own police report about the incident, the company told TechCrunch, but said no additional details have been requested. In a statement on January 20, Zoox said it was “cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident.”

The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, has also met with Zoox about the January 17 crash. The DMV told TechCrunch that Zoox filed a crash report “in compliance with California regulations.” That report is not yet publicly available.

Zoox is in the early stages of building out its robotaxi service in San Francisco. In November, the company started offering free rides to members of the public who are part of the “Zoox Explorer” early-rider program. The company is operating a similar program in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This rollout has come with challenges. The Amazon-owned company issued a recall in December to fix an issue where some of its vehicles were crossing center lanes and blocking crosswalks. (Zoox also issued two different software updates during recalls earlier in 2025 before it started offering public rides.)

The January crash in San Francisco happened when Durden “suddenly opened” the door of his car into the path of the robotaxi, according to Zoox. The company said the robotaxi “identified the opening door and tried to avoid it but contact was unavoidable.” (Durden’s employer could not be reached for comment.)

Zoox also said it offered medical attention to Durden, who allegedly declined. According to MissionLocal, Durden refused medical treatment until his car was towed.

“Safety and transparency are foundational to Zoox, and we are cooperating with local authorities to provide an accurate account of the incident,” the company said in a statement.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, the same day that federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street, the Justice Department sent a letter to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The letter did not have anything to say about the violence caused by the Department of Homeland Security’s presence in the state. Nor did it offer Minnesota any assistance in the investigation of Pretti’s death or that of Renee Good’s just more than two weeks earlier. Instead, Attorney General Pam Bondi complained that Walz had “refused to support” DHS, insisted that the state cooperate more fully with ICE, and demanded that the governor hand over its voter rolls and records on Medicaid and food-stamp recipients. Walz had “better support President Trump,” Bondi declared on Fox News.

This abusive behavior by DHS has stood out in the chaos of Operation Metro Surge. But the Justice Department has done its part, too. It has shielded federal agents from accountability, launched needless criminal investigations into Minnesota officials and residents, and pumped out propaganda to aid the far-right press in justifying ICE’s tactics. The president has always treated DOJ like his own personal law firm. Now the department is acting like DHS’s law firm as well.

DOJ first undertook the role of ICE defender in Minneapolis in the days after Good’s death, on January 7. Video captured by the phones of both bystanders and the ICE agent Jonathan Ross showed Ross firing into Good’s car repeatedly, killing her and sending her car barreling down the icy street. In prior administrations, a death at the hands of a federal officer would have been cause for the Justice Department to begin a probe into potential wrongdoing by law enforcement. But this time, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced, “There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” Though federal and local investigators typically collaborate in the aftermath of shootings by law enforcement, the FBI blocked state and local governments from accessing evidence. When a journalist asked Trump about this development, he explained that Minnesota officials should not be allowed to look at evidence, because they are “crooked.”

Most galling, instead of probing Ross’s actions, the Justice Department decided to investigate the woman he killed. According to MS NOW, FBI agents in Minnesota drafted a search warrant for Good’s car to examine the path of the bullets fired by Ross, intending to carry out a civil-rights probe. But Blanche’s office demanded that they alter the warrant for use in an investigation of whether Good had assaulted Ross. (A magistrate judge denied the request on the grounds that Good was dead.) The New York Times reported that DOJ also considered launching a criminal probe into Good’s widow, Becca Good, who was with Renee that morning. Six prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota resigned in protest of the department’s handling of the case, along with an FBI agent who’d sought to open a civil-rights investigation but was rebuffed. Several attorneys in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have since resigned as well.

After Blanche accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “encouraging violence against law enforcement,” DOJ sent out subpoenas to Walz, Frey, the mayor of St. Paul, the Minnesota attorney general, and the chief local prosecutor in Minneapolis as part of an ill-defined criminal investigation that seems designed chiefly to intimidate. This use of the Justice Department for political strong-arming has been unheard of since Watergate.

The department has also busied itself in Minneapolis with prosecuting residents opposed to what federal officials are doing in their city and immigrants trying to flee their pursuers, a tactic seen in other cities targeted for immigration enforcement. In Minnesota, DOJ has apparently run into a small challenge: Because so many attorneys there resigned over the handling of the Good case, the Justice Department has had to ask prosecutors from elsewhere in the Midwest to travel to the state to help out. Some of the cases filed so far do seem to describe potential assaults on officers, such as a pair of incidents in which two women are alleged to have bitten the fingers of the Border Patrol agents who were restraining them. Still, the Justice Department’s choice to focus on charging protesters, while enabling the violence by law enforcement that may have provoked them, is a telling indicator of its priorities.

Among the prosecutions of protesters, perhaps the strangest story involves a desperate quest by DOJ to bring criminal charges against the former CNN news personality Don Lemon. On January 18, Lemon documented a demonstration at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul by a group of activists, who accused a church pastor of also serving as the acting director of the local ICE field office. Just days later, federal law enforcement arrested three of the lead protesters. But prosecutors were unable to convince a magistrate judge to let them charge Lemon along with the other protesters. Instead of taking the hint and giving up, however, the Justice Department repeatedly tried—and failed—to bully judges into allowing them to bring the case. On Monday, the department indicated that it had dropped its effort to force the court to reconsider, but Lemon may not be in the clear. “We’re going to pursue this to the ends of the earth,” promised the Civil Rights Division leader Harmeet Dhillon.

DOJ’s obsession with pursuing charges over a single protest might seem puzzling, especially because this protest did not obviously break any laws or move beyond the bounds of protected speech under the First Amendment. As with the finger-biting cases, which featured prominently on Fox News, directing prosecutorial resources toward protesters who disrupted a church service helped amplify the administration’s portrayal of Minneapolis as a battle between godly crusaders for justice and pathetic yet demonic leftist agitators. The White House published a digitally altered photo of one of the defendants, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that both changed her stoic expression to a tearful one and darkened her skin. (Levy Armstrong is Black.)

This was the context in which Bondi sent her bullying letter to Walz on Saturday. “Accountability is coming. 🇺🇸,” she posted on X alongside a clip of her brandishing the letter on Fox News. Her post included no mention of Alex Pretti, who had died that morning.

George Packer: What should Americans do now?

After Pretti’s death, the Justice Department once again helped block off the scene from state and local investigators. This time, though, Minnesota and Hennepin County sued, and succeeded in convincing a judge to rapidly issue a temporary restraining order barring the federal government from “destroying or altering evidence.” The judge—Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee—convened another hearing on the matter on Monday, the same day that another Minnesota federal judge questioned a DOJ lawyer over Bondi’s letter during a hearing in a separate case. The state had pointed to the letter as evidence of the federal government’s effort to bully Minnesota into carrying out Trump’s will. At one point, Judge Katherine Menendez asked, “Is the executive trying to enforce a goal through force that it cannot enforce through the courts?”

Menendez has yet to rule. On Monday evening, Bondi celebrated on X that DOJ had successfully convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to pause a district court’s order barring federal agents in Minneapolis from harassing protesters. Still, the ground has shifted under the Justice Department’s feet in the days since Pretti’s death. Greg Bovino, the preening Border Patrol chief who wandered around Minneapolis posing for photos and lobbing tear gas at protesters, left the city on Tuesday, seemingly pushed out by the administration. With public anger mounting toward the White House’s deportation campaign, it’s not clear whether DOJ will continue its aggressive approach or back down.

Whatever DOJ chooses, though, any chance of it conducting independent investigations into the killings of Good and Pretti seems to have vanished. In response to the events in Minnesota, Democratic members of Congress have called for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the public’s disapproval of ICE has surged. Any real reckoning must address the rot at the heart of the Department of Homeland Security. But it will have to address the rot in the Department of Justice, too.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If recognition alone were capable of repairing harm, then the weeks surrounding the Tulsa Race Massacre’s 100th anniversary in 2021 might have begun to make the neighborhood of Greenwood whole. Oklahoma’s Republican and Democratic elected officials clamored to release public statements praising the commemoration. President Biden told an audience at Tulsa’s Greenwood Cultural Center, “For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness.” Having grown up in Tulsa, I found the pageantry of the centennial—the opening of a history center on Greenwood Avenue, the news crews that covered the events, and the concerts—unfamiliar, yet, for the moment, welcome.

The problem was what happened before—and has happened since: running down the clock on justice. At the time of the centenary, there were three living survivors: Lessie Benningfield Randle, Hughes Van Ellis, and his sister, Viola Ford Fletcher. That year, they had shared eyewitness accounts of the massacre with Congress, articulating claims for justice and redress rooted in ongoing harm. The three didn’t appear before the House Judiciary Committee with the expectation that Congress would intervene. Today, Randle, who goes by “Mother Randle,” is still alive. But Van Ellis died two years ago and Fletcher, who went by “Mother Fletcher,” died in November. Congress never did get around to direct reparations, nor did any other government body—neither the city of Tulsa nor the state of Oklahoma, which the three had sued for compensation—and now it’s too late.

The massacre began at night on May 31, 1921. It would go on to claim some 300 people, leave some 10,000 homeless, and raze more than 1,000 residences and businesses. Telling her story to the congressional committee a century later, Fletcher spoke of the massacre in the present tense: “I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lining the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burnt. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I live through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history. I cannot. I will not.”

Read: How the Tulsa Race Massacre caused decades of harm

What the massacre destroyed, a century of disinvestment calcified. In Tulsa, dispossession unfolded not as a single event, but instead through the denial of insurance claims, the exclusion from public programs, the removal of homes through urban renewal, and decades of political pressure not to speak. Even a century later, Tulsa’s northern neighborhoods remained Blacker and poorer while the rest of Tulsa accumulated wealth. In parts of North Tulsa, home to Greenwood, the average life expectancy is approximately 10 years less than that of many parts of South Tulsa. And the data sour beyond these regional or neighborhood boundaries: Black infant mortality is three times greater than for white infants in Tulsa. Across Tulsa County, Black people, on average, live six fewer years and are twice as likely as their white peers to be unemployed.

Fletcher’s life would never be the same after the massacre. She told Congress that she lost the chance to study beyond the fourth grade. She spent most of her years as a domestic worker for white families, earning so little that even at 107, she told the committee, she could “barely afford everyday needs.” Her grandson said in a radio interview that for years, his grandmother would not let him utter the word “massacre.” According to him, Fletcher spent most of her life sleeping without lying down, fearing that she might, for some reason, need to make a quick escape. What many Americans saw as a historical event, she relived daily.

With Fletcher’s death, and the prospect of personal recompense answered, the question becomes what America will remember of that day. The country is well practiced in the art of forgetting. For much of my childhood, the massacre was not mentioned in my textbooks. I did not learn its scope in school. I learned about it only through references from elders and convoluted apologies by city leaders.

What I did not understand as a child is that this absence of public memory was not mere neglect. It was the profound callousness of a city ready to bury the past and then build on top of it. T. D. Evans, the mayor during the immediate aftermath of the massacre, instructed, “Let the negro settlement be placed farther to the north and east,” because displacement offered him the chance to potentially build a train depot and residential developments, as he hustled the city toward a future cleansed of the past.

But moving on from the past—without doing the hard work of repair—wasn’t just a matter of physical infrastructure. The legal system, too, played its part. In September 2020, Fletcher, Van Ellis, and Randle became plaintiffs in a civil case to redress the harms they had survived. By then, more than 100 Tulsa Race Massacre–related cases had already been dismissed on the reasoning that descendants didn’t have sufficient standing. To not repeat prior cases, the three pursued a public-nuisance claim, a legal strategy used to address ongoing harms that burden an entire community rather than a single past injury. The strategy—which Oklahoma had just tested in an opioid case, with early promising results—was designed not only to win damages but also to force the case into discovery, where the city’s role in allowing the violence would be made public. In their lawsuit, they claimed that the massacre could not be understood as an isolated incident but as one that kick-started ongoing suffering.

They still lost. The Tulsa County District Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2023, arguing that “simply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation.” The survivors’ attorneys appealed to the state supreme court, hoping that the case might continue, only for the court to uphold the dismissal in June 2024.

As the legal process slowed, Fletcher’s persistence seemed to solidify. She intensified the pace at which she shared her story. She co-authored a book, Don’t Let Them Bury My Story, with her grandson Ike Howard, making her the oldest woman to publish a memoir. Fletcher and her brother Van Ellis obtained Ghanaian citizenship in 2023. Her story became not only a record of what she survived, but a call to others to take up the work that the courts said they could not.

Fletcher’s death shows us what’s at stake as 1921 recedes into historical memory. Without survivors to testify, the burden shifts to the rest of us to make the record whole and to insist that Tulsa’s story is not only an episode to be commemorated but a harm to be repaired.  Randle, Ellis, and Fletcher received adulation for their courage to speak out about what they experienced. They became, late in life, the subject of national recognition, because that’s what America is good at—celebrating survivors of the harm the country allowed, not compensating for the misfortune it has caused. The best America could offer these three and the community they watched burn was an investment plan, funded by philanthropy, not policy. Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols proposed a $105 million private trust, called Road to Repair, aimed at ameliorating the long-term damage of the massacre through scholarships, housing, and general reinvestment in Tulsa’s Greenwood district. None of the victims or their descendants received any direct reparations from the city or state. But for now, Road to Repair is just a plan—not a repository of funds ready to be allocated—to raise $100 million from private donors. Perhaps that’s the best that Tulsa can do: rely on charity to deliver some semblance of justice when our governments abdicate that responsibility.

Fletcher’s witness was never and could never be only about what was done to her, or to her brother or to Randle. The survivors’ lives bore the undeniable impressions of a community’s injury. Waiting her out, or her brother before her, does not end the obligation to repair. Greenwood is still there, and it has never seen justice.</div>

On a chilly day before Christmas, Teresa Rivas helped a tween boy pick out a new winter coat. “Get the bigger one, the one with the waterproof layer, mijo,” she said, before helping him pull it onto his string-bean frame. Rivas provides guidance counseling at Owen Goodnight Middle School in San Marcos, Texas. She talks with students about their goals and helps if they’re struggling in class. She’s also a trained navigator placed there by a nonprofit called Communities in Schools.

The idea behind CIS and other “community school” programs is that students can’t succeed academically if they’re struggling at home. “Between kindergarten and 12th grade, kids spend only 20 percent of their time” in a classroom, Rob Watson, the executive director of the EdRedesign Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told me. If America wants kids to thrive, he said, it has to consider the 80 percent. Educators and school administrators in San Marcos, a low-income community south of Austin, agreed. “Tests and academics are very important,” Joe Mitchell, the principal of Goodnight Middle School, told me. “But they are secondary sometimes, given what these kids’ lives are like away from here.”

Along with mediating conflicts and doing test prep, Rivas helps kids’ families sign up for public benefits. She arranges for the nonprofit to cover rent payments. She sets up medical appointments, and keeps refrigerators and gas tanks full.

A new study demonstrates that such efforts have long-term effects. Benjamin Goldman, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell, and Jamie Gracie, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated data on more than 16 million Texas students over two decades, examining data from the Census Bureau and IRS, as well as state records on academic outcomes. They found that the introduction of CIS led to higher test scores, lower truancy rates, and fewer suspensions in Texas schools. The program bumped up high-school graduation rates by 5.2 percent and matriculation rates at two-year colleges by 9.1 percent. At age 27, students who had attended a CIS school earned $1,140 more a year than students who had not.

Jonathan Chait: Why the left stopped talking about achievement gaps

The program’s impact is “quite big,” Gracie told me: Spending $1,000 on CIS increased student earnings at age 27 by $400, whereas spending $1,000 on smaller class sizes increased student earnings by $40. The researchers estimated that every $3,000 in CIS investment would increase income-tax revenue by $7,000.

Although contemporary education policy has focused intently on standardized tests, student and teacher tracking, and other accountability measures, the CIS study suggests that the United States could bolster achievement by providing more social support too. “You could have the world’s greatest teacher,” Goldman told me. “It’s only going to matter so much if you’re not actually showing up to school.” Watson said he hoped the study would lead policy makers to finance community-school programs in every low-income neighborhood. “If you care about morals and social justice, there’s something here for you,” he said. “If you care about good fiscal and economic policy, there’s something here for you.”

But the country is veering in the other direction. The White House has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from a free-school-meal initiative, ended a $1 billion grant covering mental-health counseling, and revoked $170 million from the federal community-schools program, which helps cover the salaries of hundreds of workers like Rivas. Other whole-child initiatives might lose financing if they are found to fall under the Trump administration’s DEI rubric. At the same time, the White House is reducing financial support for low-income families, cutting more than $1 trillion from SNAP and Medicaid.

The United States wants schools to act as a “great equalizer,” yet socioeconomic differences among students remain the central drivers of student outcomes. Community schools can’t prevent homelessness, pay for health insurance, or stop parents from getting deported; they cannot construct a strong safety net. Still, they can help to close the gap.

A decade ago, the San Marcos school district’s dropout rate was higher than the state average, and its standardized-test scores lower. In 2016, Michael Cardona was named superintendent and tasked with a turnaround mission.

“We have great—amazing—kids,” Cardona told me. But more than 100 students were homeless in the 8,000-student district. “That’s a lot for a town with one high school,” he said. Seven students had died by suicide in recent years. Students had been involved in 282 recorded incidents of domestic violence over an 18-month period. “Typically, it was mom trying to discipline the kid or grandma trying to discipline the kid, taking away the cellphone, then the kid beats up the family member and gets put in jail,” Cardona said.

A visit to a fifth-grade gifted-and-talented classroom put the crisis into even sharper relief for him. Cardona asked the students a softball question: What could he do for them as superintendent? One asked if he could help keep their father out of prison. Another wondered if he could stop their mother from partying every weekend. Afterward, he sat in his truck and cried. “These are the students identified as the best of the best,” he said. “We’ve got a mental-health issue in this district unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”

Cardona decided to focus not only on test scores and remediation measures but also on social support. The district expanded its health-care and counseling initiatives, putting a focus on early intervention. And it reached out to CIS, which offered to place a navigator, such as Rivas, in every school.

CIS is a half century old and works with 2 million children in 26 states. (It’s not a pilot, in other words; it’s three times the size of Head Start.) The nonprofit has a few unusual qualities. For one, it doesn’t apply rigid criteria or means tests in determining who gets help, and doesn’t provide a set menu of benefits to students and families. The model is adaptable. In some districts, navigators focus on violence prevention or absenteeism. In San Marcos, they focus on behavioral health. Inside schools, CIS staff members created lamp-lit, womblike rooms, stocked with fidget toys and snacks, where kids can calm down and talk about their feelings. Some middle-school girls told me that Rivas helped them with “drama and stuff”—meaning “girls fighting over boys.” One boy who was having trouble sleeping and had a 69 average in math told me that Rivas was helping get his eyes shut and his grades up. “You only need one more point!” she said, beaming.

CIS workers help families navigate existing public programs. “The traditional economist view would have been, Just give people cash. They’ll figure out what to do with it,” Goldman told me. But decades of studies have found that families in crisis don’t know that help is out there, possess limited capacity to research complex social-safety-net initiatives, and are averse to signing up for benefits, given the stigma. Community schools take paperwork away from stressed-out families and put it on trained employees.

CIS workers also come with a pool of funds to distribute. A freshman named Valencia Ayub told me about a time when her mother had lost a job at Dollar Tree, and her father had lost his job as an electrician. She considered going “straight to work” to help her younger sisters, rather than applying to college. CIS sent two checks, one for $500 and one for $800, to cover the family’s rent. School systems don’t have to make these payments themselves; in general, CIS is inexpensive for school districts to offer because it uses a mix of public, private, and philanthropic funding.

These kinds of wraparound supports keep kids in class, reduce the number of behavioral incidents, and make sure students are capable of learning when they sit down at their desks; as Goldman and Gracie’s study showed, they also have long-term effects. For those reasons, “there’s been a significant expansion in terms of systematic initiatives and interventions,” Anna Maier of the Learning Policy Institute told me; school districts, states, and individual institutions have built out their social-work capacity. Still, the country underinvests in kids and schools, creating achievement gaps that classroom teachers struggle to close and preventing children from reaching their full potential. The Trump administration’s withdrawing community-school financing as it slashes the safety net stands to make the problem worse.

In San Marcos, at least, the school district is seeing improvements. Kids feel safer, and the number of violent incidents has fallen. “At the end of the day,” Cardona told me, “that’s what I look at.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, the economy, and how to solve some of America’s biggest problems.

To hear some Silicon Valley insiders tell it, California is on the verge of economic suicide. This November, Californians will likely vote on a ballot initiative that would levy a one-off tax on the wealth of about 200 of the state’s richest residents. Garry Tan, the CEO of the start-up incubator Y Combinator, posted on X that the measure would “kill and eat the golden goose of technology startups in California.” Investors and tech executives are threatening to leave the state. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been angling for a centrist presidential pivot, has vowed to “do what I have to do” to stop the initiative.

Many progressives, however, see the billionaire tax as a long-overdue effort to finally force the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share. Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, calls it a “model that should be emulated throughout the country.” In their telling, hyperbolic claims about the death of innovation and entrepreneurship in California are a smoke screen for the fact that billionaires simply don’t want to pay higher taxes.

The unfortunate reality for progressive backers of the wealth tax is that what billionaires think about the policy, and how they react to it, will determine whether it succeeds. If voters approve the tax, they will be making a huge bet on billionaire psychology. That would be a very high-stakes wager indeed.

The California wealth-tax idea originated as a response to a federal tax cut. Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered taxes for corporations and rich individuals and paid for those cuts in part by reducing Medicaid spending. That left a roughly $20 billion annual shortfall in California’s health-care budget. If left unfilled, that could cause 1.6 million low-income Californians to lose their health care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In response, one of the state’s largest health-care-employee unions teamed up with a group of progressive economists and lawyers to come up with a way to make up the difference: impose a one-off 5 percent wealth tax on California’s billionaires.

The logic is simple enough: The ultra-wealthy, who amass their fortunes by owning assets as opposed to earning wages, pay very little in income taxes. According to calculations by the Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, who helped design the proposal, California’s billionaires pay approximately $3 billion to $4 billion a year in state income taxes, or less than 0.2 percent of their collective net worth of $2.2 trillion. He and the other architects of the ballot initiative determined that tapping into this pool of mostly untaxed wealth would be the most economically fair way to raise the money California needs, especially given that those same billionaires had just received a major tax break from Trump. “Right now our tax system effectively fails to tax the superrich,” Gabriel Zucman, another economist involved with the proposal, told me. “If you want to raise a lot of revenue, you need to focus on wealth.”

One serious objection to imposing a wealth tax at the state level is that it will trigger a process known as capital flight: When faced with the prospect of losing a sizable chunk of their fortune, wealthy individuals might leave the state altogether. If enough people make that choice, a wealth tax could backfire, resulting in lower long-term tax revenues. Many Silicon Valley critics of the ballot initiative have claimed that the proposal would give them virtually no choice but to leave. They say that it would result in massive tax bills that would force founders to sell off their companies, push entrepreneurs into bankruptcy, and ultimately make it impossible to build a successful company in California. “I think the technology industry kind of has to leave the state,” one anonymous venture capitalist told the tech-right publication Pirate Wires. “Because every person running a company will have to look at the math, and they will think, ‘Well obviously that cannot happen because it will literally destroy the company.’”

Already, several high-profile billionaires, including the Google co-founder Larry Page, the Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, and the Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, have reportedly begun shifting their assets out of California, and several have threatened to leave if the initiative passes. Andy Fang, a co-founder of DoorDash, claimed on X that the new tax “could wipe me out” and that it would be “irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state.” (Others, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, have said that they will remain in California regardless of what happens. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it. I’m perfectly fine with it,” Huang recently told Bloomberg.)

The tax’s designers, however, think they’ve come up with a clever solution to capital flight: a one-off tax that is retroactive, based on a billionaire’s residency status on January 1, 2026. In other words, unless they’ve already fled the state, billionaires won’t be able to move to avoid paying the tax. “At this point, there’s no financial incentive to leave California,” Zucman said. “You’re going to pay the same amount either way.”

Contrary to what its opponents claim, moreover, the tax is carefully designed to avoid the most common objections. If billionaires are worried that the government will improperly value their assets, they can submit independent third-party appraisals. If they can’t come up with the full 5 percent all at once, they can spread out payments over five years, though they would be charged interest. If their fortunes are tied up in “illiquid assets” such as a privately held start-up, they can defer the tax rather than having to sell their stake. “So many of these criticisms are either completely ignorant or made in bad faith,” Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley who helped write the bill, told me. “I think it’s pretty clear that these guys will basically say anything to protect their giant mountains of wealth.”

Brian Galle: The myth of the mobile millionaire

Even if the wealth tax wouldn’t nuke the state’s tech start-ups, however, it would roughly quadruple the amount that California’s billionaires currently pay annually in taxes. And if most empirical research suggests that the superrich do not tend to move in response to state-level tax hikes, none of that research has considered a tax nearly as large as what is being proposed in California. “There’s just a different kind of anxiety in the air this time,” Cristobal Young, a sociologist at Cornell University and the author of The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight, told me. “We’re not talking about paying a little more in income taxes. There’s a lot more at stake and a whole lot of unknowns.”

Part of that anxiety stems from the fact that billionaires don’t believe that the tax will really be one time only. “It’s not a one time; it’s a first time,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and Trump’s AI czar, recently told CNBC. “And if they get away with it, there’ll be a second time and a third time.” That fear isn’t completely unfounded. In 2012, for instance, California voters approved a ballot initiative to raise the income-tax rate for high-earners for seven years to fill a budget shortfall. In 2016, voters overwhelmingly chose to extend the tax until 2030, and are likely to extend it even further. Voters could very well behave similarly with the wealth tax, especially given that the state’s budget problems probably won’t magically solve themselves in the next few years. “I just don’t think the idea that this will be one time is very credible,” Zachary Liscow, a tax scholar at Yale Law School who worked on a national wealth-tax proposal under the Biden administration, told me. “If this tax is really as successful at bringing in revenue as its proponents claim, I have a hard time imagining voters will just let it go away.”

This is where a debate ostensibly about economics reveals itself to be about political science and behavioral psychology. Proponents of the ballot initiative argue that Silicon Valley’s unmatched ecosystem of founders, investors, and talent is so alluring that no single tax would cause current and would-be billionaires to relocate. “Study after study has shown that the probability of becoming a billion-dollar company is higher in Silicon Valley than anywhere else,” Galle said. “You aren’t going to give that up just because there’s a chance that sometime in the future there’s going to be a tax on your wealth.”

Opponents of the bill, though, worry that the tax will be viewed as a harbinger of a soak-the-rich mentality among California voters that makes the state a risky place to do business. Start-ups and venture-capital investment could begin to flow to lower-tax states; the next hub of technological innovation may end up being seeded in Austin or Miami instead of Silicon Valley. “The real fear is less about the specific tax than the message it sends: that California is a dangerous place to be a billionaire,” Alan Auerbach, an economist at UC Berkeley, told me. “If people begin to fear that California has removed guardrails that allowed the wealthy to do well, they might get nervous and go elsewhere.”

Elias Wachtel: New York can’t be progressive without the one percent

Each side’s argument is rooted in a set of interlocking assumptions about how California voters will vote, how the state’s ultra-wealthy think they will vote, how those predictions will factor into would-be entrepreneurs’ decisions about where to locate their companies, and whether Silicon Valley will retain its unparalleled allure—all in response to a type of tax that has never been tried in the United States before.

For proponents of the proposal, going forward with the wealth tax is worth the risk, if only because the alternative is so much worse. Better to lose a handful of billionaires than for millions of low-income Californians to lose their health care. Other ways to generate the same revenue—such as raising income or corporate taxes, or cutting other parts of the budget—come with their own set of hard economic, political, and moral trade-offs. There is also a sense of basic fairness in asking society’s very wealthiest individuals, all of whom just got a massive tax break, to hand over a small portion of their staggering fortunes in order to help society’s least well-off.

And yet, doing so would mean wagering the future of California’s tax base on the proposition that billionaires are bluffing when they threaten to leave the state. Progressives tend to be clear-eyed about the lengths the rich will go to avoid paying their fair share. They should recognize a risky bet when they see one.

            <h2>The Islamic Republic’s Predatory Contract With Its People</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-regime-predatory-contract/685782/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Iran’s 86-year-old supreme leader, who believes that he represents God’s will on Earth, ordered what now appears to be one of the deadliest two-day mass slaughters in modern history. According to estimates provided by two anonymous senior officials in the country’s ministry of health, as many as 30,000 citizens may have been killed during this 48-hour rampage on January 8 and 9. If these estimates prove correct, Ali Khamenei’s January 2026 massacre—the climax of a decades-long reign of repression—will rank among modern history’s deadliest single episodes of state violence.

Since the rise of the modern state in the 17th century, political legitimacy has come to rest on a social contract, in which the government provides security and sustenance in exchange for the consent of the governed. The Islamic Republic’s relationship with Iranians does not resemble a social contract, but a predatory lease signed in 1979 that has long since expired.

The terms of this lease—imposed by the landlord upon the tenants—are nonnegotiable:

You, the tenant, will live inside the religious fever dream of a man, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who viewed the state not as a vessel for national advancement, but as a weapon for personal retribution, and whose copious writings offered detailed pronouncements about the religious penalties for fornicating with animals, yet no insights on how to run a modern economy. “Economics,” he once said, “is for donkeys.”

You will be ruled for four decades by his successor, Khamenei, whose views will remain fixed no matter how much the world, and Iranian society, changes. He will preach resistance and pretend he is a pious man who eschews worldly wealth. But an entity called Setad—a shadowy financial empire under his personal control—has amassed assets valued at more than $95 billion in 2013 and potentially exceeding $200 billion today, much of it confiscated from Iranians who fled political and religious persecution.

We, the landlord, will micromanage your personal life. Whom you love, the movies you watch, the music you listen to, what you drink—all will be subject to our approval. Under our Sharia-based laws, women will be stoned for adultery, while men are permitted to take multiple wives.

You will be subjected to routine power outages, even though your country possesses the world’s third-largest proven reserves of oil and second-largest reserves of natural gas. We will preside over one of the highest inflation rates in the world, wiping out your savings as the national currency loses more than 99 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the revolution.

We will so profoundly mismanage our environment–due to corruption and incompetence–that we will dry up your rivers and turn your lakes into salt flats, creating dust storms that choke your cities. We will pump the groundwater until the land beneath Tehran literally sinks, imperiling its habitability for future generations.

Our national slogans will be “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” never “Long Live Iran.” As Khomeini once put it, “Patriots are useless to us. We need Muslims. Islam is opposed to patriotism.” While we chant these slogans, we will send our own children to study in the West.

We will treat half the population as second-class citizens. If you are a woman, your testimony in court will be worth half that of a man’s, and your inheritance will be half that of your brother’s. We will make a piece of cloth—the hijab—the primary symbol of our state’s authority, and we will beat you to death in detention centers for wearing it “improperly.”

Although we will rule from a moral pedestal, we will lie without reserve. As the longtime Khamenei adviser Mohammad-Javad Larijani likes to say, “Being able to keep a secret even if you have to mislead is considered a sign of maturity. It’s Persian wisdom. We don’t have to be ideal people. Everybody lies. Let’s be good liars.”

Our greatest national export will be the intelligence of our nation. We will suffer from one of the highest levels of brain drain in the world. One hundred fifty thousand of our citizens will leave every year, at a cost that even our own officials have conceded could amount to about $150 billion annually.

Rather than recruit the brightest minds from our diaspora back to Iran to contribute to our nation, we will take them hostage and sell them for ransom to the United States and European countries. We will take visiting foreign academics hostage and trade them for convicted terrorists.

Though we will boast about our independence, 90 percent of our oil exports—the lifeblood of our economy—will go to China, which demands steep discounts.

We will use a sizable portion of our national wealth—tens of billions of dollars—to finance and arm Arab militias throughout the Middle East. This should not be confused with concern for the well-being of Palestinians. In contrast to American, European, and Arab governments that fund Palestinian human-welfare initiatives, our resources will arm and finance Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Our goal is not to build Palestine but to destroy Israel. We will achieve neither.

We will spend well more than $500 billion—including the revenue lost to sanctions—for a nuclear program that provides neither energy nor deterrence, as was evidenced by Israel and America’s repeated penetration of Iranian air space.

We will ally with Russia, a country that excised a third of our territory in the 19th century, that occupied and attempted to take more territory in the 20th century, and that benefits from keeping our country isolated so that we cannot compete with them in global energy markets or for influence in Central Asia.

We will preach a “resistance economy” of austerity for you, while our Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates as a tax-exempt mafia that controls as much as 50 percent of the national economy, including telecommunications, ports, and construction. You will stand in line for subsidized bread while our elites smuggle iPhones and luxury cars through exclusive, unmonitored airport terminals. Our middlemen will funnel your national wealth into European property empires—buying ski resorts in Austria and mansions on London’s Billionaires’ Row—all while financing the very guards who repress you.

Omid Memarian: What Trump fails to grasp about Iran

We reserve the right to use you as human shields. When we fear an attack, we may refuse to close civilian airspace, shoot down a passenger plane full of our own citizens, lie about it for three days, and then torment the families of the victims.

If you protest our corruption or incompetence, you will be called a terrorist and charged with “waging war against God” or “corruption on earth.” We will execute you without due process, maintaining the world’s highest execution rate per capita.

We will build a digital wall around you. We will slow your internet speeds to a crawl and block global platforms to prevent you from communicating with one another or the outside world, while our officials post freely on X to spread propaganda to the West.

Even before this latest massacre, the gap between the Iranian government and its citizens was one of the widest on Earth. A critical mass of Iranians, including within the regime, have realized that the structure is condemned. They know that breaking the lease will be costly and terrifying, especially without foreign help. But they also know that living under its terms is at best a dead end, and at worst a death sentence. They do not seek to renegotiate the contract. They seek to evict the landlord.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The statements from congressional Republicans after Saturday’s shooting of Alex Pretti were relatively mild. Lawmakers said that they were “deeply troubled” or “disturbed” by the second killing of an American citizen by federal immigration officers this month; most called for an investigation into Pretti’s death. But the statements kept coming, one after another, all through the weekend and into yesterday.

The reactions from across the GOP sent an unmistakable message in their volume, if not in their rhetoric, to Donald Trump: Enough. The defining characteristics of the Republican-controlled Congress during the president’s second term have been silence and acquiescence. That so many in his party felt compelled to speak up after Pretti’s killing was a sign that Republicans had finally lost patience with federal agents occupying a major American city—a deportation operation that has soured the public on one of Trump’s signature policies and sunk the GOP’s standing at the outset of a crucial midterm-election year.

Republican committee chairs in both the House and the Senate summoned top administration officials to public hearings—a rarity in the past year. From the right, the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates criticized comments from senior law-enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, that blamed Pretti for carrying a firearm and said that people should not bring guns to public demonstrations. (Videos showed that officers disarmed Pretti before they fatally shot him.) Few Republican leaders rushed to defend the unnamed agent who’d killed Pretti, nor did they echo the rhetoric of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, who referred to Pretti, an ICU nurse, as a “would-be assassin.” In at least one case, the lack of comment from a top Republican was significant: House Speaker Mike Johnson—ordinarily quick to pick up talking points from the president and his top aides—has said nothing about the shooting.

The harshest Republican condemnation came from one of the party’s candidates for governor of Minnesota, Chris Madel, who yesterday declared that he was quitting the race in part because of the federal deployment. “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said in his video announcement, “nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”

Watching all of this unfold was Trump, who already did not like what he saw. For the president, it was a rare winter weekend when he wasn’t in Palm Beach or at the golf course. He never left the White House. And he was glued to news coverage that showed little besides another horrific shooting in Minnesota. Videos of Pretti’s killing were inescapable on TV and social media, and the story broke through to nonpolitical media—drawing reactions from the likes of Charles Barkley and Bill Simmons—in ways that the fatal shooting of Renee Good on January 7 did not.

Trump’s first move was to defend the federal officers carrying out the immigration operations in the moments before the deadly clash. He reposted a Department of Homeland Security–supplied photo of the gun Pretti had been carrying, before again making claims about fraud in Minnesota’s immigrant communities. But he otherwise remained publicly silent as more videos of the shooting cast doubt on the administration’s statements about what had happened.

Trump began asking aides and outside advisers if it had been an “okay” shooting, trying to figure out whether the agents had made the right decision to fire, a White House official and two allies close to the West Wing told us. His top aides, among them Miller—including in a post that was amplified by Vice President Vance—immediately blamed Pretti for instigating violence (as the administration blamed Good after her death) and suggested, without evidence, that Pretti had been a “domestic terrorist.”

But this time, fewer Republicans joined the chorus. And as the weekend wore on, more GOP lawmakers and conservative media voices began to call for an investigation into the shooting and to question the administration’s assertion that an armed Pretti had violently resisted agents. Senator John Curtis of Utah called out Noem by name, saying that he disagreed with her “premature” response to the shooting.

Trump grew concerned at the response, the White House official and one outside ally told us. He again on Sunday demanded more cooperation from local officials and blamed Democratic lawmakers for violence in Minnesota—but he noticeably did not defend the officers who’d shot Pretti, in either his posts or in a brief interview with The Wall Street Journal. The president, who has long enjoyed near-total fealty from Republicans, took note of the lawmakers calling for a probe or quietly suggesting that federal officials roll back operations in the Twin Cities. (He was glad that the lawmakers did not blame him personally for the administration’s response, one of the allies told us.)

Trump was particularly bothered by the NRA’s strong reply to an assistant U.S. attorney in California appointed by the administration who said that if a person approaches law enforcement with a gun, there is a “high likelihood” that officers will be “legally justified in shooting you.” Trump has long prided himself on the support he receives from those he calls “my Second Amendment people,” and he has often been deferential to the gun lobby despite its waning influence.

When something becomes too controversial for Trump’s liking—or when the blowback becomes too fierce—he has in many cases found a way to declare some sort of victory, even a far-fetched one, and then move on (as he did with Greenland last week). Aides wondered whether he was trying to do the same with Minneapolis. Yesterday, Trump appointed his designated “border czar,” Tom Homan, to head the federal operation in Minnesota. Although most Democrats are deeply skeptical of Homan, he has not been involved in the Twin Cities operations and has been more consistently careful with his language than Miller or Noem. (After Good’s killing, Homan said that he would reserve judgment on the matter until an investigation had concluded.) Trump later claimed, after a phone call, that he and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are largely aligned in their goals for the federal operation—and even offered some faint praise for the governor, who is under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding the operation of immigration agents.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that if local officials increased their cooperation with the federal government, Border Patrol agents would “no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.” The administration decided to pull some federal agents out of Minnesota, aides said, but did not suggest a sweeping overhaul to the mission in the state or to Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

Trump’s unease, along with pushback from Republicans, grew by the hour and forced a major change: As The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff first reported, the administration yesterday ousted Gregory Bovino from his role as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” and removed him from Minnesota, where he had become the public face of the federal operation. Many in Trump’s orbit saw Bovino as an easy scapegoat; he’d claimed, without evidence, that Pretti had planned to attack federal agents. (His choice of coat and interactions with Minnesotans in social-media posts had also generated an uproar.) Despite this, a senior administration official insisted that Bovino’s transfer had been in the works before the announcement of Homan’s new role. Not all of Trump’s allies were happy with the change in Minneapolis. “You can’t sugarcoat this,” the Trump ally Steve Bannon said on his podcast. “It wasn’t just a blink. It was a crater.”

Last night, the president met for two hours in the Oval Office with Noem and one of her top advisers, the former Trump-campaign chief Corey Lewandowski, but the senior official made clear to us that no additional leadership changes are imminent. Leavitt, in her briefing, also said that Trump continues to have confidence in Noem. For the moment, she remains at her job.

It is out of your hands now, and the domains mean nothing anymore.

It was good while it lasted, but it is gone.

You can run your own shit on top of the existing network. But it will be a struggle to get anyone to visit because while incessant advertisement, marketing data collection, and social media content-tuning has ruined the Internet those things are also why the masses keep coming back.

It&#39;s like building a gingerbread house and then telling obese german children not to visit.

I remember visiting Tim&#39;s website, at CERN, at the dawn of the web.

Today&#39;s web bear little resemblance to it in any way shape or form.

But good ideas are common. The question is whether it&#39;ll get implemented and used by enough nations to make a difference.

If the EU adopts this, which is possible as there&#39;s a pressure to move away from the US, then there&#39;s a real possibility that it&#39;ll make a difference. But one nation isn&#39;t nearly enough to push things over the tipping point. Especially with the UK and US governments determined to destroy privacy and internet security.

The internet is a public place. What you do there is public. The whole world can watch while you do. It is designed that way, and there&#39;s nothing that can change that.

He can come up with whatever pods he wants, with the user having absolutely control over how it&#39;s used. But he can&#39;t control what everyone else observes in that public place, and what they do with it. Advertising companies like Google and Meta will still surveille everything they possibly can (which is, increasingly, everything), collect every byte available, subject it all to their algorithms, and sell advertising based on it.

And once those massive databases exist in private hands, governments can, and will, compel those companies to fork it over for whatever purpose they choose, be it criminal investigation or political oppression or genocide. That is the inherent nature of government.

The only way for the user to opt out is to not be on the internet, which is increasingly crippling in today&#39;s world, because the user has no role in what happens in that public place other than just being there to be spied on.

Why do you think IPv6 has gone nowhere?  IPv4 and CGNAT is the most recent method of blocking participation.  You still need to access a server from a major company to do anything.

I keep a web server active not for popularity, nor traffic, BUT JUST IN CASE.

It&#39;s as &#39;free&#39; as a vps can be, which is to say nothing is &#39;free&#39;.

I can whack up a Raspberry Pi, LAMP stack or whatever, and it&#39;s maybe a $60 cost today, SD card included.

Access to the Internet? Never was free. Even ARPANet required data lines, not free. I&#39;ve used dial-up, DDS2, T-1/E-1, BRI, cable, fiber, none ever free.

I know what Tim Berners-Lee means, but there will always be choke points, and those today are, fundamentally, ac

It&#39;s hard to find people with Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s integrity. We should &#39;own&#39; our own lives. It&#39;s a lot deeper than just being watched.

hoopla about creating a super-intelligence, has no one seen the movie space odyssey 2001? Do you know what happened to the astronauts?

Of the hominids. Thinking they will surely never go extinct, despite that having happened to the, what, 6 other alternatives?

I think so far it was dumb luck and a scale to small to wipe out everybody. But in the future it will require actually acting intelligently with a global view. Things do not look good.

At any given point in time, there seem to have been 4-6 different branches of humanity, with only one of these surviving to the next round (possibly occasionally more). There have been something like 5 different rounds in the past 2.2 million years. This suggests that between 20 and 30 different lineages of hominids have gone extinct. If some of those other lineages did successfully branch, then this figure goes up accordingly.

Homo Sapiens aren&#39;t a particularly competent branch. Most of the early innovation

Homo Sapiens aren&#39;t a particularly competent branch.Yes, they are.Most of the early innovation (art, music, symbolic thought, ritual) was done by Neanderthals and only later adopted by H. SapiensFlatly incorrect.
It is absolutely true that earlier hominids also dabbled in such things, but Homo Sapiens mastery of these things was vastly more sophisticated. This is evidence even in the initial migrations out of Africa of Homo Sapiens that colonized places that Neanderthals never tread, simply due to improve tool mastery.

This is evidence even in the initial migrations out of Africa of Homo Sapiens that colonized places that Neanderthals never tread, simply due to improve tool mastery.

Humans (homo sapiens) are late arrivals who inherited almost everything from earlier hominids and from lots of other animals who learned to use tools millions of years ago.

Using tools and making tools are very different things. The only species that actually manufacture tools are crows, humans, and chimpanzees.

Obviously if there were already hominids in Britain and Europe 500k years ago isn&#39;t it quite possible that more advanced hominid species such as Neanderthals, Sapiens and Denisovans and others evolved separately in place all around the world and that we can no longer assume Sapiens evolved only somewhere in Africa then spread out and highly diversified over a very short time frame -- 50k years or so?No.
The level of diversity is the proof.
There is more difference between 2 random people of the same &quot;race&quot; than there is between an average of 2 random races.
We have a single common ancestor, and it was recent.
The multiple-loci position is untenable due to the genetic similarity of extant geographically isolated populations.We know that the hominids migrated out of Africa about 1 million years ago, long before Sapiens appeared. So stop pretending that Sapiens didn&#39;t evolve from different sets of hominids separately in multiple places to a genetically compatible state. That DOES happen and it does a better job of explaining why Sapiens are so diverse today. Scientists frequently get things wrong and then refuse to recognize what is obvious. It&#39;s the structure of scientific revolutions...No.

In general, this viewpoint is spread by people who don&#39;t want to accept that they come from black folks. My buddy Matt used to argue this shit all the time.
It is wrong, and usually a sign of deep-seated racist views.

They aren&#39;t competing with Amazon, they are working for Amazon. Amazon was using UPS for deliveries, but being Amazon they demanded terms that were simply unprofitable for UPS. So UPS is now winding down that partnership, and presumably Amazon is either looking for another sucker, or cracking the whip on its own delivery drivers a bit harder.

Yes, you could help yourself to not attribute mistakes to malice. But it&#39;s more rewarding to find fault in others.

Amazon and their drivers do a pretty good job with delivery instructions. They deposit the packaged as requested snap a photo a leave.

Anything remotely difficult like please pace the item in the box at the end of my driveway, and UPS sticks a &#39;we are sorry we missed you&#39; sticker some place I won&#39;t find it for two days and demands I drive 30min each way to get my package.

won&#39;t be sorry to see Amazon take over the rest of their deliveries

Boy, I have the exact opposite experience. I know my UPS driver&#39;s name (and two of the alternates that occasionally sub for him).  If he has something that needs a signature for me he will either flag me down if I am driving or call me to get a verbal authorization. I still have his Christmas card in my car though since Amazon packages were eliminated-- I have only gotten one other UPS delivery in the past two months and he took vacation time that day.

I have consistently had similar experiences with UPS dri

What are you on? Of course a fence building company you can sub-contract a given job.

Meh, it&#39;s rsilvergun.  I don&#39;t like the crass hate posts he was getting for a while, but he is pretty unconnected to reality.

Amazon now has their own drivers delivering out here in the country. It just started a couple months ago.

Now we have three delivery trucks scooting around the place, Fed-Ex, UPS, and Amazon. Four if you count the post office which just dropped off a box yesterday. CO2 emissions be damned.

Even Microsoft window management is better than Chrome&#39;s, and this seems to just carry forward that tradition of not even bothering to use a capable pre-existing solution and crap out a low quality one.

They can&#39;t use any of the existing WMs or compositors because they have their own display engine. But you&#39;re right, it&#39;s sad to see them fail so hard when they could just copy something that doesn&#39;t suck

It looks like they copied something that does suck.  All the behavior looks like Windows 11 but with the menu at the top of the display instead of the bottom.

I&#39;d assume that is absolutely deliberate too. I am sure goal is cannibalize the portable Windows market, further.

Yeah, it looks fine. Maybe the window borders could do with a bit more definition, but it&#39;s pre-release and they do seem to intend you to use it as a tiling window manager for the most part.

Mostly based on other ChromeOS and some Android desktop mode experience, and a big example is lack of tiling beyond just left-right split.

Indeed. Those that ignore what is already out there and works well, will forever implement crappy &quot;solutions&quot;. Personal arrogance, &quot;Not Invented Here Syndrome&quot; and flat-out incompetence.

To do tech well, you need to stand on the shoulders of giants. That starts with knowing what they did and where they succeeded (and failed).

Yes, using the international English spelling within the codename.

Whenever I see &quot;inadvertent&quot; leaks of new UIs, functionality, etc., I can&#39;t help thinking that they might be purposeful trial balloons. I&#39;m sure companies want to see the people&#39;s surprised reactions, as opposed to the responses from those who have been waiting for the release of a new version.

There is plasma mobile. But if you look at which devices it supports, you suddenly notice how &quot;open&quot; the Android ecosystem really is. Without proprietary blobs (that are of course Android specific) most things won&#39;t work. Mobile devices are just not built like computers, the manufacturers only support what they want the user to run on it and tolerating Custom ROMs is goodwill and not guaranteed. Booting something different from Android is on most devices nearly impossible.

Would not bother me at all if Aluminum ditched X for Wayland. X11 is an interesting kludge that has been &#39;made to work&#39; over the years. Mostly by taking advantage of various lax permissions, poorly defined functions, and tolerance of workarounds because, frankly, X did not want to be bothered with fixing much if it could avoid it. That&#39;s a good strategy for games and toys, bad strategy for industry standards.

I, for one, welcome our new window manager and compositor overlords.

At least that way, more of the apps available on Android on phones and tablets will be available for desktops running it.  That could reduce some of the demands on current PCs, such as TPM 2.0 for Windows 11.  It may not solve the AI slop, given that Google is about as aggressive as Microslop in pushing it

Linux distributions are so close to benefit from the disaster of Windows 11 and you wish for the Google monopoly to extend to PCs?

How does this compare with Samsung DEX that has been on Android for years to provide a desktop experience?  I played with it a bit when work started requiring us to be in-office but without assigned cubes and static equipment, as I could, at least in theory, do everything I needed with a keyboard, mouse, screen and my phone driving it all with a VNC app to do my real work on a Linux server.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On For all the buzz surrounding them, AI agents are simply another form of automation that can perform tasks using the tools you&#39;ve provided. Think of them as smart macros that make decisions and go beyond simple if/then rules to handle edge cases in input data. Fortunately, it&#39;s easy enough to code your own agents and below we&#39;ll show you how.

Since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, literally dozens of frameworks for building AI agents have emerged. Of them, LangFlow is one of the easier and more accessible platforms for building AI agents.

Originally developed at Logspace before being acquired by DataStax, which was later bought by Big Blue, LangFlow is a low-code/no-code agent builder based on LangChain. The platform allows users to assemble LLM-augmented automations by dragging, dropping, and connecting various components and tools.

In this hands-on guide, we&#39;ll be taking a closer look at what AI agents are, how to build them, and some of the pitfalls you&#39;re likely to run into along the way.

Before we jump into building our first agent, let&#39;s talk about what comprises an agent.

At its most basic, an agent is composed of three main components: a system prompt, tools, and the model. - Click to enlarge

In general, AI agents are going to have three main components, not counting the output/action they ultimately perform or the input/trigger that started it all.

For more complex multi-step tasks, multiple models, tools, and system prompts may be used.

If you&#39;re using a Mac or PC, deploying LangFlow Desktop is as simple as downloading and running the installer from the LangFlow website.

If you&#39;re running Linux, you&#39;ll need to deploy the app as a Docker container. Thankfully this is a lot easier than it sounds. Once you&#39;ve got the latest release of Docker Engine installed, you can launch the LangFlow server using the one-liner below:

After a few minutes, the LangFlow interface will be available at http://localhost:7860.

Warning: If you&#39;re deploying the Docker container on a server that&#39;s exposed to the web, make sure to adjust your firewall rules appropriately or you might end up exposing LangFlow to the net.

LangFlow Desktop&#39;s homepage is divided into projects on the left and flows on the right. - Click to enlarge

Opening LangFlow Desktop, you&#39;ll see that the application is divided into two sections: Projects and Flows. You can think of projects as a folder where your agents are stored.

Clicking &quot;New Flow&quot; will present you with a variety of pre-baked templates to get you started.

LangFlow&#39;s no-code interface allows you to build agents by dragging and dropping components from the sidebar into a playground on the right. - Click to enlarge

On the left side of LangFlow Desktop, we see a sidebar containing various first and third-party components that we&#39;ll use to assemble an agent.

Dragging these into the &quot;Playground,&quot; we can then config and connect them to other components in our agent flow.

In the case of the Language Model component shown here, you&#39;d want to enter your OpenAI API key and select your preferred version of GPT. Meanwhile, for Ollama you&#39;ll want to enter your Ollama API URL, which for most users will be http://localhost:11434, and select a model from the drop down.

If you need help getting started with Ollama, check out our guide here.

With LangFlow up and running, let&#39;s take a look at a couple of examples of how to use it. If you&#39;d like to try these for yourself, we&#39;ve uploaded our templates to a GitHub repo here.

In this example, we&#39;ve built a relatively basic agent to analyze spreadsheets stored as CSVs, based on user prompts.

This data analytics agent uses a Python interpreter and an uploaded CSV to answer user prompts - Click to enlarge

To help the agent understand the file&#39;s data structure, we&#39;ve used the Type Convert and DataFrame Operations components to extract the dataset&#39;s schema and help the model understand the file&#39;s internal structure.

This, along with the full document&#39;s file path, is passed to a prompt template, which serves as the model&#39;s system prompt. Meanwhile, the user prompt is passed through to the model as an instruction.

LangFlow&#39;s Prompt Template enables multiple data sources to be combined into a single unified prompt. - Click to enlarge

Looking a bit closer at the prompt template, we see {DATA_HEADER} and {DATASET_FILEPATH} defined as variables. By placing these in {} we&#39;ve created additional nodes to which we can connect our database schema and file path.

Beyond this, the system prompt contains basic information on how to service user requests, including instructions on how to call the PYTHON_DATA_PLAYGROUND Python interpreter, which we see just above the prompt template.

This Python interpreter is connected to the model&#39;s &quot;tool&quot; node and apart from allowlisting the Pandas and Math libraries, we haven&#39;t changed much more than the interpreter&#39;s slug and description.

The agent&#39;s data analytics functionality is achieved using a Python interpreter rather than relying on the model to make sense of the CSV on its own. - Click to enlarge

Based on the information provided to it in the system and user prompts, the model can use this Python sandbox to execute code snippets and extract insights from the dataset.

If we ask the agent &quot;how many monitors we sold,&quot; in the Langflow playground&#39;s chat, we can see what code snippets the model executed using the Python interpreter and the raw response it got back.

As you can see, to answer our question, the model generated and executed a Python code snippet to extract the relevant information using Pandas - Click to enlarge

Obviously, this introduces some risk of hallucinations, particularly on smaller models. In this example, the agent is set up to analyze documents it hasn&#39;t seen before. However, if you know what your input looks like — for example, if the schema doesn&#39;t change between reports — it&#39;s possible to preprocess the data, like we&#39;ve done in the example below.

Rather than relying on the model to execute the right code every time, this example uses a modified Python interpreter to preprocess the data of two CSVs or Excel files before passing it to the model for review - Click to enlarge

With a couple of tweaks to the Python interpreter, we&#39;ve created a custom component that uses Pandas to compare a new spreadsheet against a reference sheet. This way the model only needs to use the Python interpreter to investigate anomalies or answer questions not already addressed by this preprocessing script.

AI agents are just automations that should, in theory, be better at handling edge cases, fuzzy logic, or improperly formatted requests.

We emphasize &quot;in theory,&quot; because the process by which LLMs execute tool calls is a bit of a black box. What&#39;s more, our testing showed smaller models had a greater propensity for hallucinations and malformed tool calls.

Switching from a locally-hosted version of OpenAI&#39;s gpt-oss-120b to GPT-5 Nano or Mini, we saw a drastic improvement in the quality and accuracy of our outputs.

If you&#39;re struggling to get reliable results from your agentic pipelines, it may be because the model isn&#39;t well suited to the role. In some cases, it may be necessary to fine tune a model specifically for that application. You can find our beginner&#39;s guide to fine tuning here.

Along with the model, the system prompt can have a significant impact on the agent&#39;s performance. The same written instructions and examples you might give an intern on how to perform a task are just as useful for guiding the model on what you do and don&#39;t want out of it.

In some cases, it may make more sense to break up and delegate a task to different models or system prompts in order to minimize the complexity of each task, reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, or cost optimize by having lower cost models tackle easier pieces of the pipeline.

Up to this point, our examples have been triggered by a chat input and returned a chat output. However, this isn&#39;t strictly required. You could set up the agent to detect new files in a directory, process them, and save its output as a file.

LangFlow supports integrations with a wide variety of services that can be extended using agentic protocols or custom components written in Python. There&#39;s even a Home Assistant tie-in if you want to build an agent to automate your smart home lights and gadgets.

Speaking of third-party integrations, we&#39;ve hardly scratched the surface of the kinds of AI-enhanced automation that are possible using frameworks like LangFlow. In addition to the examples we looked at here, we highly recommend checking out LangFlow&#39;s collection of templates and workflows.

Once you&#39;re done with that, you may want to explore what&#39;s possible using frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP). Originally developed by Anthropic, this agentic protocol is designed to help developers connect models to data and tools. You can find more on MCP in our hands-on guide here.

And while you&#39;re at it, you may want to brush up on the security implications of agentic AI, including threats like prompt injection or remote code execution, and ensure your environment is adequately sandboxed before deploying them in production. ®

            <div id="article-text">Things aren&#39;t over yet for Fortinet customers – the security shop has disclosed yet another critical FortiCloud SSO vulnerability.

Those hoping for a reprieve following last week&#39;s patch pantomime are out of luck. After users reported successful compromises of FortiCloud SSO accounts, despite being patched against an earlier flaw, the vendor confirmed there was an alternate attack path.

According to a security advisory published Tuesday, that alternate path was assigned a separate vulnerability identifier (CVE-2026-24858, CVSS 9.4), and the company disabled FortiCloud SSO connections made from vulnerable versions. Patches are not yet ready.

Fortinet confirmed that CVE-2026-24858, an authentication bypass bug, was exploited in the wild by two malicious FortiCloud accounts, but these were blocked as of January 22.

Customers of FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, FortiOS, and FortiProxy are all affected and should upgrade to the version recommended in the advisory to restore FortiCloud SSO services. Some versions have safe releases available already, although patches are still in the works for most.

FortiWeb and FortiSwitch Manager are still being investigated for their exposure to the security flaws.

The original attacks were first spotted by Arctic Wolf around January 15, and seemed to involve two bugs Fortinet patched in December, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719.

The vulnerabilities in question allowed attackers to bypass SSO checks using specially crafted SAML responses, and the observed attacks appeared to be using CVE-2025-59718 to compromise firewalls.

Fortinet confirmed on January 22 that the attacks were indeed bypassing that December patch, exploiting FortiCloud SSO, but doing so through alternate means. The patch was effective against one attack path, but not via this separate one.

Carl Windsor, CISO at Fortinet, warned at the time that although the attacks of which the company was aware only targeted FortiCloud SSO, all SAML-based SSO implementations were vulnerable.

The latest advisory states that the authentication bypass flaw can be exploited by an attacker, provided certain conditions are met.

&quot;An authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer may allow an attacker with a FortiCloud account and a registered device to log into other devices registered to other accounts, if FortiCloud SSO authentication is enabled on those devices.&quot;

&quot;Please note that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in default factory settings. However, when an administrator registers the device to FortiCare from the device&#39;s GUI, unless the administrator disables the toggle switch &#39;Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO&#39; in the registration page, FortiCloud SSO login is enabled upon registration.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Anyone scanning the news might think it&#39;s pedal to the metal as far as AI agent implementations go, but there is a slump in rollouts as many organizations figure out what to do next, Redis CEO Rowan Trollope told The Register.

The company behind the Redis database, which built a following as a cache in cloud application architecture to become the most popular database on AWS, is trying to help users get out of the lab with AI agent projects and into production.

Earlier this month, Gartner forecast that investment from software vendors and cloud providers would propel a trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year as investment hits $2.52 trillion. Enterprise users, however, are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; as reactions to enterprise project pitches go from &quot;that was a great idea&quot; to &quot;where&#39;s my revenue?&quot; the research firm said.

Trollope said the phenomenon was reflected in his experience of helping customers build projects implementing AI agent platforms in business.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen fewer examples of real successful production agents than I would have imagined [in terms of] anything outside of engineering,&quot; he said. &quot;It is still quite hard to do, and only the biggest companies in the world understand this is the future they&#39;re investing in. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to stop. They realize they need to have this next-generation platform.&quot;

Redis started life in 2009 as an attempt to build a performant key-value database. By late 2020, it was the most popular choice as a cache and message broker in cloud-native application stacks. Redis has since broadened its ambitions, adding features for machine learning and support for JSON documents in a bid to evolve beyond its caching roots. Now it is supporting AI implementations. Last year, it announced LangCache, a fully managed REST service designed to reduce expensive and latency-prone calls to LLMs by caching previous responses to semantically similar queries.

While Gartner sees a lot of enterprise LLM spending going to large application vendors as users seek low-risk options by upgrading software they already use, Trollope said organizations need to think about the range of sources they have to draw from to get AI agents to make decisions.

While Salesforce might store what discount you gave a customer and Workday stores information about employees, agents making decisions may also require information from email, instant messaging platforms, and other sources, he argued. Hence, organizations building out AI agent systems were using frameworks from Microsoft, Google, or LangChain, an independent engineering platform for building, testing, and deploying reliable AI agents.

&quot;The information needed to make the most relevant decisions is often not immediately obvious to the agent,&quot; said Trollope. &quot;For example, if I were to build an agent that is going to interface with my customers and allow it to do pricing, why and when is the agent allowed to make exceptions to the standard pricing policy? If all you want is the standard pricing policy, that&#39;s very easy, but you&#39;re not going to replace any human beings with that. What you need is to find out where the humans apply their judgment and what data they used to make that decision. That&#39;s where pulling that data together is difficult, because it&#39;s often unstructured. It&#39;s sitting in Slack threads, in email chains, in text messages. That&#39;s what we see as the number one problem.&quot;

The data requirements for AI agents to make meaningful decisions are part of the motivation for vector features in databases. A slew of vendors, including Redis and Oracle, as well as specialist vendors, are backing the concept. With a paucity of successful case studies, the jury might still be out on whether returns will follow. But Redis, at least, sees big businesses continue to invest despite the challenges. ®

            <h2>Flush with cash, SK hynix spawns mysteriously named 'AI Co.'</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/sk_hynix_ai_co/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SK hynix is surfing the AI hype wave by setting up what it nebulously describes as a solutions biz to further exploit the hysteria.

The chipmaker is already flying high on the back of booming demand for datacenters. Its share price has quadrupled in the past year as it supplies a vital component, one now in tight supply. Judging by its financials published today, the AI gravy train isn&#39;t slowing.

The Korean corp is launching a new subsidiary in February, referred to only as &quot;AI Company&quot; (AI Co.) at this point. It aims to become &quot;a key partner&quot; in the AI datacenter ecosystem to &quot;proactively seize opportunities.&quot;

The market is now seeing demand for integrated AI solutions that combine hardware, software, and services rather than just standalone products, SK says.

The Register asked for more information, but a spokesperson told us: &quot;AI Co. aims to serve as an optimized AI solutions provider for various industries by investing in the AI datacenter ecosystem.&quot; The plan is to focus first on software for AI system optimization, then gradually expand investments within the ​​datacenter arena, we&#39;re told.

Investment in other companies and technologies is also part of the circular AI economy. SK hynix says that &quot;solutions commercialization&quot; is one of the proposed business activities too.

SK hynix says it is committing $10 billion to starting the new operation. An interim management team and a board of directors will be named next month.

Shipments of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) aimed at AI servers are forecast to triple by 2027, according to Counterpoint Research. Unit sales are estimated to exceed 15 million by 2028, surpassing shipments of the datacenter GPUs that currently dominate AI processing.

ASICs are generally used more for inference, and are cheaper than high-end GPUs in terms of operating costs, but may incur higher upfront costs. Broadcom is expected to take 60 percent market share in 2027.

It will establish the biz by restructuring Solidigm, the existing California-based SSD subsidiary. Solidigm will change its name to AI Co. before transferring SSD manufacturing operations to a new subsidiary named Solidigm Inc.

One of the aims seems to be to continue promoting the &quot;chip technologies such as HBM&quot; that have helped propel SK hynix into the AI hype cycle.

Memory demand is &quot;materially outpacing supply,&quot; according to analysts at IDC, with chipmakers reallocating production capacity to favor components for servers and GPUs rather than consumer devices as prices rise across the board.

The effect of the memory crisis can be seen in the Korean company&#39;s latest financial results, with revenue for 2025 up 47 percent to ₩97.14 trillion ($67.9 billion) and Q4 revenue up 66 percent on a year ago to ₩32.8 trillion ($22.9 billion)

It&#39;s also good news for Netherlands tech giant ASML, which develops photolithography machines needed for chip production. Its calendar Q4 revenue of €9.7 billion ($11.6 billion) came in toward the higher end of previous forecasts, but the firm expects demand for its most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems to increase significantly this year.

None of this, however, seems to be good news for end users who face paying significantly more for anything that incorporates memory, including PCs and smartphones as well as servers and GPUs. Analysts predict that PC shipments will fall this year simply because there won&#39;t be enough memory chips to go round and prices will jump as a result. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty years ago, Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into its flight, killing its crew of seven and exposing the management culture and decision-making process that led NASA to launch on a freezing January day.

Four decades on, the technical facts that led to the destruction of Challenger are clear. Erosion had been noted in the rubber O-rings that sealed the segments of the twin solid rocket boosters (SRBs) mounted to either side of the Shuttle stack&#39;s external fuel tank. The temperature at launch was 36°F (15° colder than any previous launch).

Just after liftoff, the primary and secondary O-rings at the base of the right-hand SRB failed. The Rogers Commission report, an official investigation into the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, noted: &quot;At 0.678 seconds into the flight, photographic data show a strong puff of gray smoke was spurting from the vicinity of the aft field joint on the right Solid Rocket Booster.&quot;

More puffs were visible as the Shuttle accelerated. &quot;The vaporized material streaming from the joint indicated there was not complete sealing action within the joint.&quot;

During the flight, the Shuttle experienced several high-altitude wind shear events, all within design limits, but which caused the SRB steering system to be &quot;more active than on any previous flight.&quot;

At 58.788 seconds, a flickering flame was noted on the right SRB, at or near the aft field joint. That plume increased, and from approximately 62 seconds, the control system began to correct for the forces caused by the plume. This carried on for another nine seconds. At 64.66 seconds, the first visual indication that the flame had breached the External Tank was noted.

At approximately 72 seconds, a series of events happened in rapid succession. The lower strut linking the right SRB to the tank was severed, permitting it to rotate around the upper strut. A structural failure of the hydrogen tank occurred, releasing large amounts of liquid hydrogen and enveloping the Space Shuttle in a massive explosion.

The Shuttle was traveling at Mach 1.92 at an altitude of 46,000 feet. Its reaction control system ruptured, and the reddish-brown colors of the burning hypergolic fuel were visible on the edge of the main fireball. The Orbiter broke apart under severe aerodynamic loads, with several sections visible, including the forward fuselage and a mass of umbilical lines ripped from the payload bay.

The crew consisted of Dick Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. It was third time lucky for Jarvis after having to make way for US Senator Jake Garn in April 1985 and US Representative Bill Nelson in January 1986. Nelson&#39;s flight, STS-61-C, was the mission chronologically before.

In his book Riding Rockets, former astronaut Mike Mullane speculated on the fate of the crew. The cockpit had survived more or less intact, but all electrical power was lost at the moment of breakup. &quot;The mayhem of breakup lasted only a moment before the equally startling calm of free fall began.&quot;

The Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPs) for the pilot, Mike Smith, were activated, probably by Judy Resnik or Ellison Onizuka. &quot;Scobee and Smith were test pilots and reacted as they had been trained,&quot; wrote Mullane. &quot;They had faced countless serious emergencies in their flying careers. They knew the situation was perilous, but they were in a cockpit with a control stick, and there was a runway only twenty miles away. They believed they had a chance.&quot;

The cockpit, however, was electrically dead. No amount of button mashing or switch flicking could restore control to the blossoming cloud of debris that Challenger had become. The crew members on the upper deck had window views of the disaster as the cockpit tumbled over its arc. The three on the mid-deck – Ronald McNair, Christa McAuliffe, and Gregory Jarvis – were in a darkened, tumbling room, with no communication to inform them of events.

Investigators were not able to conclusively state that the crew was unconscious by the time the cockpit hit the ocean surface. At 207 mph and with a deceleration force of more than 200 g, it wasn&#39;t survivable. Unlike Mullane, former Apollo astronaut and chief of the Astronaut Office John Young reckoned that even with the activation of the PEAPs, the crew had only a few seconds of useful consciousness. Enough time to flick some switches, but not much more. He noted in his book Forever Young that the &quot;PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air that was not all that helpful at the altitude of the breakup.&quot;

The managerial and cultural factors behind the disaster are equally well documented. The Rogers Commission stated: &quot;The decision to launch the Challenger was flawed. Those who made that decision were unaware of the recent history of problems concerning the O-rings and the joint and were unaware of the initial written recommendation of the contractor advising against the launch at temperatures below 53 degrees Fahrenheit and the continuing opposition of the engineers at Thiokol after the management reversed its position.

&quot;They did not have a clear understanding of Rockwell&#39;s concern that it was not safe to launch because of ice on the pad. If the decision-makers had known all of the facts, it is highly unlikely that they would have decided to launch 51-L on January 28, 1986.&quot;

As John Young put it later, after summarizing the concerns of the Thiokol engineers, worries about the erosion noted on the O-rings, and the decision-making process that led to the launch: &quot;We astronauts would have thought differently.&quot;

The Challenger disaster reverberated through NASA in the years after, though not always loudly enough to prevent the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia. In the chapter &quot;Echoes of Challenger&quot; in their book Comm Check…, Michael Cabbage and William Harwood presented parallels between the last flights of Challenger and Columbia, as presented to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board [PDF].

Has NASA learned from the tragedies? It appears so, judging by the recent Starliner debacle, where caution and safety appeared to win the day in the decision to return the Boeing astronauts in a SpaceX capsule rather than risk a trip in Boeing&#39;s CST-100. However, there is also an argument that the astronauts should never have launched in the first place, considering the faults that were stacking up on the ground.

Today&#39;s anniversary is an important reminder for engineers to speak out when something doesn&#39;t look right, and for managers to listen.

There are many sources of information regarding the Challenger disaster. This article drew on Mike Mullane&#39;s Riding Rockets and John Young&#39;s Forever Young. The Rogers Commission report is also an invaluable source, as are Charles Perrow&#39;s Normal Accidents and David Harland and Ralph Lorenz&#39;s Space System Failures. ®

            <div id="article-text">West Midlands Police&#39;s acting Chief Constable has suspended use of Microsoft Copilot following a controversy that led to the early retirement of his predecessor over a recommendation to ban Israeli football fans from a Birmingham match.

The force&#39;s recommendation to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the team&#39;s Europa League match against Aston Villa on November 6 was partly based on material generated by the AI tool about disruption to a non-existent match against London club West Ham.

On January 6, former Chief Constable Craig Guildford told Parliament&#39;s Home Affairs Committee that his officers had not used AI to find this material, then corrected this in a letter to say they had.

Following criticism by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and others, Guildford retired at age 52. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said that he had already started the process that would allow him to fire Guildford when he announced his retirement.

The force&#39;s acting Chief Constable, Scott Green, speaking at a public meeting with Foster on January 27, said he could not discuss the details of how Copilot was used as this was under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct and West Midlands Police&#39;s professional standards department.

But Green added: &quot;On my first day in office, I took the immediate step to turn off access to Microsoft Copilot within the force. Like everybody else, we will be using AI in the future, we will use Microsoft Copilot, but we are not going to do so until I am satisfied with the conclusion of what has happened in this case and until we have got broader policy and guidelines in place.&quot;

Responding to a query from The Register, Foster said: &quot;Artificial intelligence has an important role to play in policing, to increase productivity, improve crime detection, and manage emerging threats. However, use of AI must be ethical, lawful, transparent, and evidence-based, so as to maintain the trust and confidence of the public.&quot;

&quot;Serious concerns have arisen about the use of Microsoft Copilot by West Midlands Police, when preparing to police the Aston Villa v Maccabi Tel Aviv football match in November 2025,&quot; Foster added. &quot;It is important therefore that West Midlands Police pause its use, whilst resolving matters relating to the governance, oversight and regulation of its use, as a matter of urgency.&quot;

In the meeting, Foster also questioned Green about poor record keeping of meetings with Dutch police and findings of confirmation bias in the force&#39;s assessment of the risk from Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. Green apologized for the way the force had handled the work, describing the failings as &quot;damning.&quot; He said the force is working to rebuild trust with Jewish communities by investigating every report of antisemitic hate crime and introducing antisemitism training for staff.

In a white paper published this week, the government laid out plans for a big increase in the use of AI in policing, spending £115 million over the next three years on a new National Centre for AI in Policing to be known as Police.AI that will initially focus on automating administrative work. ®

            <div id="article-text">But that doesn’t mean your favorite artist made any more money.

But that doesn’t mean your favorite artist made any more money.

Today, Spotify announced that it had paid out more than $11 billion to the music industry in 2025. It’s an impressive-sounding number that’s a full $1 billion more than it paid last year. And, according to Spotify, that accounts for roughly 30 percent of the entire recording industry’s revenue. And, according to Spotify, that accounts for roughly 30 percent of the entire recording industry’s revenue. This figure, however, is purely a measure of royalties paid to the music industry and does not include merch or ticket sales, nor does it include audiobook royalties or podcasting deals.

However, it is important to note that this doesn’t mean that Spotify paid out $11 billion to musicians and artists. That money went to “rightsholders.” That includes labels, distributors, publishers, and more.

Spotify says that it doesn’t have insight into how much of that money eventually finds its way into artists’ hands. Agreements for individual artists can vary greatly. However, it’s not uncommon for an act on a major label to see as little as 15 percent of their royalties. Though indie labels typically offer much more favorable deals, with 50 percent or more going to the artist.

Spotify says that once again, roughly half of those royalties were paid to independent artists and labels. That includes DIY acts that self-release music through distribution services like DistroKid or TuneCore, as well as those signed to indie labels. But it also potentially includes library content and some so-called “ghost artists,” which have been the subject of controversy. Spotify’s Global Head of Music Communications, Chris Macowski, says the company doesn’t have more detailed data on how payouts to independent acts break down.

Macowski did say that over 12,500 artists generated more than $100,000 in royalties in 2025. That’s up from 10,000 in 2024. Spotify claims that is more than the number of artists being stocked on shelves in record stores “at the height of the CD era.” However, The Verge was unable to independently verify this claim, and Macowski was unable to provide sourcing at the time of publication.

Because royalties are calculated by dividing up a finite pool of money, the more songs that are streamed, the lower the per-stream payments are to artists. Unless Spotify decides to take a smaller cut of proceeds (it currently keeps 30 percent), the only way to grow that pool is to either grow its subscriber base or raise prices. Artists with fewer than 1,000 streams still receive no payout from Spotify.

In its post announcing the $11 billion in royalty payments, Spotify also teased future plans that seem aimed at addressing criticism it’s received. For one, it promises that “new solutions” are in the works to address scams, artist impersonation, and spam content. It acknowledges that “AI is being exploited by bad actors to flood streaming services with low-quality slop”, in an attempt to steal revenue from real artists, so it will be introducing changes to artist verification.

The company also seems to be leaning more fully into human curation in response to growing backlash against the algorithm. It said it will “bring more of the human voice behind that curation into the listening experience.”None of that, however, is likely to quell the continued complaints from artists that Spotify pays less than its competitors.

Halide’s Mark III update includes HDR and ProRaw support for Process Zero, plus a new film simulation.

Popular iPhone camera app Halide is debuting a major update today: Halide Mark III. It’s been years in the making, and it’ll be available as a “Public Preview,” letting users get their hands on new features while design is finalized. This update includes the next iteration of the app’s much-discussed Process Zero mode, adding HDR and ProRAW support to what is intended to be a hands-off, anti-computational image processing method. There’s a new black-and-white film simulation that also supports HDR, and more new “Looks” to come.

This is my semi-regular cue to remind you that HDR is not a dirty word. We tend to associate the term with an over-processed look when high-contrast scenes are translated to an SDR display. But true HDR displays, like the ones on most modern smartphones, can display a wider range of tones, and image formats that support HDR can take advantage of this capacity for brighter highlights. Contrast can exist alongside highlight detail, shadows can be shadows, and everybody gets a pony. Or something like that.

That’s the HDR Process Zero is adding support for, so if it sounds antithetical to the whole Process Zero experience, maybe give it a try. In a related move, you’ll be able to shoot ProRaw in Process Zero so you can toy with a version of your image that’s been through part of Apple’s processing pipeline and retains more flexibility for tweaks after capture. Which goes hand-in-hand with another new Process Zero feature: brightness and shadow adjustments, called Tone Fusion. Halide’s blog post is careful to point out that it doesn’t use AI, and is less heavy-handed than Apple’s default processing.

If you’re looking for something totally different, Halide now offers its own monochrome film simulation called Chroma Noir, which also supports HDR that gives the brightest highlights a little extra pop. Halide’s blog post reminds us that film itself is a high dynamic range medium, and if you’re still allergic to HDR, you can turn it off anyway.

The Mark III update is available now; subscribers can toggle it on within the current app. The final update will be available free of charge to all Halide II subscribers. Halide is $19.99 per year, or $59.99 if you make a one-time payment.

They’re a great budget alternative to the AirPods Pro 3, offering solid noise cancellation, sound, and wireless charging.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The AirPods Pro 3 may be on sale for $199 ($50 off), but that’s still a lot of money. If you want noise cancellation for less, fortunately you can buy the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation for $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart. That’s the cheapest they’ve been since the holidays, and only $20 more than their lowest price to date.

For the price, the AirPods 4 do a surprisingly good job of tuning out the outside world. While they don’t drown out noise as completely as the AirPods Pro, they significantly reduce ambient and low-frequency sounds on planes and in offices, especially when listening to music. In our testing, outside noise was easy to ignore even with the volume set to about 50 percent.

Beyond noise cancellation, the AirPods 4 offer the best sound we’ve heard from an entry-level AirPods model so far, with richer bass than previous generations. They also add a more robust IP54 rating for water and dust resistance and even boast a few Pro-level features, including wireless charging support, a built-in speaker on the charging case so you can track them via Apple’s Find My app, and crystal clear call quality. You also get other perks like support for live translation courtesy of an iOS 26 update, along with a natural-sounding transparency mode.

That said, they’re still the more affordable model, so you miss out on extras like a heart rate sensor, on-ear volume controls, and the ability to use them as hearing aids. Still, they deliver most of what people actually want at a much lower price.

            <h2>Beyond Meat’s protein soda might be its last chance and best hope</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/science/869209/beyond-meat-immerse-protein-soda">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ‘crisp and refreshing’ protein drink is a sign of a company running out of time to turn it around.

Beyond Meat just launched a new product that’s even further from meat than ever before: a protein soda. Beyond Immerse is the company’s first product that makes no attempt to replicate meat whatsoever, marking a sharp shift in Beyond’s business model. It might seem like it comes out of left field, but it all clicks into place once you know just how badly the veggie burger business is working out for Beyond. A pivot to protein is still a long shot for a company that’s never turned an annual profit — but it’s an attempt to tap into the one market left that might offer it hope.

Immerse is an oddity in and of itself. Unlike most protein drinks, which are usually chalky at best, it claims to be “crisp and refreshing” and comes in three fruity flavors: Peach Mango, Lemon Lime, and Orange Tangerine. Each flavor then comes in two versions, with either 10g or 20g of protein, at either 60 or 100 calories per 12oz can, with 7g of fiber either way.

As you’d expect from Beyond, Immerse is entirely plant-based. The protein comes from peas and the fiber from tapioca, with stevia, “natural flavors,” and a few juice concentrates and food colorings to round out the ingredient list. Beyond makes sure this ticks off a few more of the health food boxes, promising plenty of antioxidants and electrolytes too.

Immerse’s macronutrients are almost suspiciously impressive. I drink a protein shake most days, and 100 calories’ worth of my powder of choice would only net me 19g of protein and essentially no fiber at all, delivered in a semi-palatable sludge that I must try — and fail — to convince myself tastes like a milkshake. If Immerse can actually deliver better macros, and is as “crisp and invigorating” as Beyond promises, the appeal is obvious. Other people seem to agree. On the Beyond Test Kitchen site, where the limited first run of Immerse is exclusively available, every released flavor is already sold out.

Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising. Protein snacks, drinks, and supplements are a big and growing business. US sales of ready-made protein shakes grew 71 percent between 2021 and 2025, and they’re now an $8 billion market. Much of that protein comes from dairy-based whey, but plant-based protein is growing too — sales of both drinks and powders grew 11 percent from 2023 to 2024 according to the Good Food Institute, making up a $450 million business in its own right. Those numbers pale in comparison to the larger “functional drinks” market — prebiotics, probiotics, fiber, protein, electrolytes, preworkout, postworkout, CBD, and more — that was worth over $200 billion in 2024 and is only expected to grow from here. The drinks fridge in my local store is overflowing with gut-friendly kombucha, cold-pressed ginger shots, and electrolyte-packed recovery drinks from brands big and small, with more every time I look. Poppi, a prebiotic soda that touts the benefits of apple cider vinegar, has drawn investment from Shark Tank, spent millions to run Super Bowl ads two years in a row, and in 2025 was acquired by Pepsi for a cool $1.95 billion (it also settled a class action lawsuit alleging its “gut-healthy” claims were misleading, but hey, it can’t all be good news).

If there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit

You can see why Beyond wants in. It’s already got “pioneering expertise in unlocking the power of plants,” according to founder and CEO Ethan Brown, and is one of the few brands in plant-based food that can truly claim to be a household name. More to the point, protein drinks are clearly profitable — and if there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit.

Beyond Meat was founded by Brown in 2009 and within a few years was generating excited headlines suggesting that the future of food was here. In 2019, Beyond went public; its shares launched at $25 each but rose to $65 on the first day of trading, making it the fastest-growing US IPO since Palm Inc. in 2000. A few months later shares peaked at just under $240 each, giving the company a valuation of over $14 billion. It secured supermarket distribution with Walmart, Target, and Kroger; supplied its fake meat to McDonald’s, KFC, and Subway.

But the glory days didn’t last long. Beyond has posted straight losses ever since it went public. Profit sometimes seems like an optional afterthought in modern capitalism, but if investors don’t see profit, they do expect to see growth, and that’s where Beyond has stalled: after a peak in 2021, Beyond’s annual revenue has steadily declined, down to $326 million in 2024. None of those fast food deals yielded permanent products on US menus. Beyond’s stock price has been in freefall for years, aside from a short-lived rally as a meme stock last October. It’s currently trading at below a dollar per share, placing it at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is facing a class action lawsuit from its own shareholders, who allege it hid the need for a $77.4 million write-down of aging assets.

What went wrong? While Beyond Meat’s management have no doubt made mistakes over the years, really it’s simply the highest profile victim of a collapse in the market for meatless meat. The Good Food Institute found that US plant-based meat sales had dropped 7 percent from 2023 to 2024, marking the third straight year of decline. “The category is smaller today than it was two years ago, four years ago, five years ago,” Peter McGuinness, the CEO of Beyond’s chief rival Impossible Foods, told New York earlier this month. “That’s not good.”

In fact Beyond and Impossible have arguably done well by surviving so long, but both are struggling. Impossible has never delivered on long-rumored plans for an IPO of its own, likely put off by Beyond’s public problems, but has suffered repeated rounds of layoffs; last year McGuinness told The Wall Street Journal that profitability was likely years away.

By 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier

Both companies sit at the nexus of two major trends that are working against them. The first is that meat is back on the menu. The Good Food Institute notes a 4 percent decline in sales of plant-based foods between 2023 and 2024, while the Food Industry Association found that meat sales grew almost 5 percent over the same period, to a record $105 billion. The number of vegetarians and vegans has declined, with Gallup’s 2023 Consumption Habits poll estimating 1 percent of the US population are vegan and 4 percent vegetarian, down from 3 percent and 5 percent in 2018. But vegetarians were never meant to be Beyond’s whole market — it was supposed to persuade swathes of the rest of us to eat less meat in favor of plant-based alternatives. For a while it seemed to be working — by 2023, nearly half of US restaurants offered vegan menu options, and cutting back on meat consumption, especially to reduce climate impact, was at the core of the cultural zeitgeist. But by 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier.

That would be bad enough for Beyond, but it has a second problem: processed food is out too. And a patty of pea protein, oils, and starches, pushed through an extruder and treated so that it will appear to bleed, is pretty darn processed. Researchers have linked ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to 32 different harmful health effects, The Lancet has labeled them a global health threat, and San Francisco is suing processed food giants. Then there’s RFK Jr., whose new dietary guidelines include perhaps the only part of current American health policy I could get behind, urging Americans to limit highly processed foods (and, in a double whammy for Beyond, to eat more meat). There’s no real evidence yet of a decline in sales of UPFs as a whole, but anyone trying to eat more healthily right now is unlikely to be recommended Beyond patties. Instead they might be told to eat whole foods, to stick to snacks with fewer than five ingredients, to eat more meat but maybe cut back on beef. Beyond doesn’t enter the picture.

This all goes some way to explaining why Beyond has turned for salvation in, of all things, soda. Next time you’re passing a supermarket drinks fridge, take a look at the “wellness drinks” on offer. You know two things they almost all have in common? They don’t include meat (I hope), and they’re pretty heavily processed. Health-conscious eaters don’t want their food to be made in a factory or packed with preservatives, but rarely seem to mind when it comes to what they drink. My Instagram feed is packed with fitfluencers promoting “clean” eating and whole foods, while they shill branded discount codes for processed protein powders. There’s a double standard at work that likely won’t last forever, but as long as it does, you can see why Beyond Meat wants to take full advantage.

It’s unlikely that a protein soda, no matter how refreshing or fiber-packed, will turn Beyond’s fortunes round entirely. But right now it doesn’t need that: it just needs time. Time to persuade investors to stick around, time to pull the share price up by a buck or two, and maybe just time for food fads to change once more and give meatless meat a second life.

﻿Fauna Robotics’ Sprout encourages human interactions with an expressive face and a soft foam body.

A startup called Fauna Robotics has revealed a new humanoid robot called Sprout it’s been developing over the past two years. Standing around 3.5-feet tall, Sprout’s design, featuring a soft padded exterior, a wide head, and expressive mechanical eyebrows, was inspired by some of science fiction’s friendlier robots like Baymax and Rosie Jetson, the startup’s co-founder and CEO, Rob Cochran, told the Associated Press.

With articulated limbs and grippers for hands, Sprout looks ready to tackle dishes, tidy up around the home, or join a factory assembly line alongside humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas. But that’s not why Fauna Robotics developed the humanoid. It’s initially being sold to other robot developers, researchers, universities, and tinkerers who may not have the resources to develop their own humanoid platform.

Fauna Robotics says Sprout’s “movement, perception, navigation, and expression all work out of the box,” so that others can focus on developing unique applications for the humanoid instead of having to spend time teaching it to do basic things like walk. While it may be destined for labs and research facilities away from the public at first, Sprout was still developed to be approachable and function alongside humans. It’s lightweight, quiet, and was designed with “no pinch points or sharp edges” for safety reasons. It’s not folding laundry yet, but the potential is there.

While buying a Sprout may be cheaper than engineering a humanoid scratch, it’s still priced at $50,000, according to the Associated Press. That puts it well out of the reach of most consumers, but some of the startup’s earliest customers include companies like Disney and Boston Dynamics. It’s not known how much robots like Atlas cost, but it will certainly be a lot cheaper for Sprout to take damage from a bad fall than Boston Dynamics’ most advanced humanoid.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/28/1131835/what-ai-remembers-about-you-is-privacys-next-frontier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

A startup’s ads for controversial embryo tests hit the New York City subway.

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/france-turns-digital-sovereignty-into-policy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What: The European Commission unveiled EU Inc (“28th regime”), a single EU-wide legal company structure designed to let startups incorporate once and operate across all member states.
Who it affects: European startups & scale-ups, founders, VCs, international investors.
How: Reduces legal fragmentation, standardises corporate and investment structures, lowers friction for cross-border scaling.
Impact timing: Strategic impact now (capital & expectations), real operational impact from 2027–2028.

What: The EU proposed mandatory rules to remove and replace technology from suppliers deemed “high-risk” in telecoms and other critical networks.
Who it affects: Telecom operators, infrastructure providers, governments, Chinese tech vendors, cybersecurity supply chains.
How: Forces equipment replacement, raises capex, hardens security requirements across Europe.
Impact timing: Immediate policy impact, execution over the next few years.

What: European institutions publicly backed a strategy to reduce reliance on US technology across cloud, software, semiconductors and AI, often referred to as building a European “tech stack.”
Who it affects: US hyperscalers, European cloud & AI companies, policymakers, public procurement.
How: Shapes future regulation, funding priorities and government tech buying decisions.
Impact timing: Political and strategic impact now, regulatory and market impact medium-term.

This week wasn’t about hype:
EU Inc sets the future structure, high-risk tech phase-out enforces security now, and tech sovereignty defines Europe’s direction.
