            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <h2>Home Depot Deploys Havana-Style Sonic Weapon Against Day Laborers</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) are running up on migrant workers in Home Depot parking lots, the home improvement corporation has decided to take a stand — against the migrant workers.

Reporting by The Guardian reveals a cruel new initiative being rolled out to one high-traffic Home Depot location in Los Angeles’ Cypress Park: high-pitched noise machines meant to shoo away day laborers.

The Intituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California (Idepsca), an advocacy group for migrant workers, is calling for the removal of three sonic devices they say are causing migrant workers to suffer headaches and nausea.

In some areas, it’s common for day laborers to congregate outside home improvement stores like Home Depot, where they can find new gigs, catch rides to job sites, and quickly buy new equipment or material. It’s all part of the informal gig economy, a system which exploits poor and working class people for cheap labor.

Home Depot’s sound devices, advocates say, are punishing these folks at the bottom of the ladder.

“They chose to weaponize sound,” Los Angeles city councilwoman Eunisses Hernandes said at a conference. “Devices like these are used as torture against our people.”

One worker described to The Guardian how he has to wear ear plugs to block the excruciating noise, saying it “penetrates your bones.”

Hernandez also said that the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has begun using the devices on its property.

“This is the people’s land,” she said. “This is Caltrans land that is owned by Californians who pay taxes. The people’s land is being used to torture the people.”

The noise machine evokes tales of a mythic weapon supposedly responsible for the ailment known as “Havana syndrome,” which specifically seems to effect US intelligence officers stationed in Havana, Cuba.

No direct evidence of Cuba’s supposed sonic weapon has ever surfaced, though the Home Depot ear blasters do have another precedent: riot control weapons. In situations like the Ferguson uprising of 2014 or the Dakota Access Pipeline protest of 2016, police have deployed “sound cannons,” mobile arrays capable of incapacitating people with high-amplitude noise.

In other words, the same tactic has been refined from a tool of police control to a mechanism to protect corporate property. In both cases, sound is deployed as a weapon to repel unwanted people from a space, closing any chance for a dialogue.

The timing of the Home Depot deployment is significant, coming on the heels of a high number of brutal ICE raids in which Latino-looking workers are rounded up at random, stuffed into cars, and brought to deportation centers.

So far, Home Depot has been silent about the raids happening on its property. But given the chaos these agents cause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Home Depot is trying to wash its hands of the whole thing — “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”

WATCH: ICE agents jumped out of a rental truck and arrested 16 people outside of a Home Depot in Los Angeles as a part of what CBP calls “Operation Trojan Horse.” In a statement, Penske, the rental truck company ICE agents used during this raid, said the company was not made aware of the operation. #immigration #ice #la #losangeles

Asked for comment on the sonic warfare, Home Depot told The Guardian that the machines are a “safety initiative… intended to deter and prevent illegal overnight parking in the area,” with no connection to any “immigration enforcement.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have discovered an astonishing exoplanet that’s stretching our understanding of what’s possible for these distant worlds. And when we say say “stretch,” we mean it literally.

The roughly Jupiter-mass object, designated PSR J2322-2650b, orbits just one million miles away from its star, or one percent of the Earth’s distance from the Sun, with a single “year” lasting just 7.8 Earth hours. And at such proximity, the extreme gravity of the star — an exotic type known as a pulsar — pulls the entire planet into an oblong shape, like a lemon or a football.

The findings, published in a new study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are so unusual that the astronomers are having to consider if they represent an entirely new class of cosmic object.

“It’s the stretchiest planet that we’ve confirmed the stretchiness of,“ lead author Michael Zhang, an exoplanet scientist at the University of Chicago, told the New York Times.

The planet’s sun is a type of rapidly spinning neutron star. These are the almost impossibly dense stellar cores that are left over in the aftermath of a supernova, containing mass equal to our entire Sun in a package the size of a human city. (The resulting gravity is so extreme that if you could scoop just a tiny teaspoon of one of these objects without being instantly crushed into a soup of pure neutrons, which is what neutron stars are, it’d weigh trillions of pounds.)

Some of these neutron stars spin, becoming pulsars, and emit a sweeping beam of energy along its poles like a lighthouse, appearing to telescopes as a repeating signal.But since it emits mostly in gamma rays, it also means its light is invisible to telescopes like the James Webb, which see in infrared wavelengths. This provides a perfect opportunity to study an exoplanet, which are often outshined by the light of their star.

“This system is unique because we are able to view the planet illuminated by its host star, but not see the host star at all,” coauthor Maya Beleznay, a physicist at Stanford University, said in a NASA statement. “So we get a really pristine spectrum. And we can study this system in more detail than normal exoplanets.”

Their observations revealed that just as unusual as the planet’s lemon shape is the composition of its atmosphere. With surface temperatures up to 3,700 degrees Fahrenheit —which is four times hotter than Venus, the hottest world in the solar system — it’s almost entirely dominated by helium and carbon, something that’s never been seen before on any planet. That’s because molecular carbon easily binds with other elements commonly found on planets and especially gas giants, such as oxygen and nitrogen, suggesting that these elements must not be present.

With a weird composition comes deeply peculiar weather. The astronomers speculate that clouds of carbon soot float through the air. Near the core of the planet, these clouds can condense into shards of solid diamond.

As it stands, everything about PSR J2322-2650b is an enigma. Few pulsars are known to have a planet, let alone one that’s shaped like a lemon, has graphite for clouds, and lacks the elements detected on other worlds.

One possibility is that this configuration is actually a type of star system known as a black widow binary, in which the pulsar slowly siphons material from a smaller stellar object in its orbit, sucking the life out of it until it’s devoured completely.

But this has only been observed between a pulsar and another star, not a planet. That raises the possibility that the exoplanet is actually some kind of stellar remnant that’s already been whittled away at for eons. “It would have lost 99.9 percent of its mass, and we just happened to catch it right at the very end,” coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington told the NYT.

The more exciting alternative is that we’re witnessing an “entirely new type of object that we don’t have a name for,” Zhang suggested to the paper.

“Did this thing form like a normal planet? No, because the composition is entirely different. Did it form by stripping the outside of a star, like ‘normal’ black widow systems are formed? Probably not, because nuclear physics does not make pure carbon,” Zhang elaborated, via NASA. “It’s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The executive branch has been infiltrated by an unexpected entity: a random livestreamer.

On Friday, the White House said it was launching an investigation after some bearded dude’s YouTube stream suddenly showed up on its official website, Bloomberg reports, heightening the absurdity of our already tenuous reality.

The livestream was hosted by @RealMattMoney, who can be seen in a Bloomberg screenshot — see below — on the White House’s “Live News” section sitting at a typical streaming setup, and wearing gaming headphones and a dark gray t-shirt. An overlay shows his stream chat, where viewers praise his analysis. Beneath the video window, the stream’s title, displayed in elegant White House font, promises there will be “no mid-stream ads,” plus a little descriptor offering a $10 discount if you click a link for “StreamYard.”

The stream was visible on the “Live News” section of the official White House website shortly before midnight Thursday, appearing and disappearing for around an hour, according to Bloomberg‘s reporting.

RealMattMoney claims he had no idea about any of this.

“There’s no way this is real, right?” he tweeted Friday, responding to the reporting. “I was just trying to stream with my buddies.”

The video stream appeared to show a YouTuber, who describes himself as &quot;a shepherd for individual investors.&quot; Read more: https://t.co/6luLYBiyCH📷️: https://t.co/t99jnI2LNZ pic.twitter.com/AQTkCJzV65

While it seems mostly innocuous, the strange incident is bound to raise eyebrows given the Trump administration’s track record of cybersecurity gaffes, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth accidentally leaking secret bombing plans in an unsecure group chat.

@RealMattMoney, whose real name is Matt Farley, gives investor advice to his audience. When not in front of a webcam, he works as a petroleum engineer in Texas, and is a fan of president Trump, he told Bloomberg. “Had I known I would be on the White House page I would probably have dressed a little differently,” the 34-year-old added.

On his socials, he further lamented the missed opportunity to impress his dear leader, adding that he “would have had a different message than personal finance.”

As it stands, it’s not clear if Farley’s five minutes of fame was the result of a hack or an accidental post, per Bloomberg.

            <h2>Waymo resumes service in San Francisco after robotaxis stall during blackout</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-as-robotaxis-stall-during-blackout/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets.

Numerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled at roads and intersections as human drivers were either stuck behind them or weaved around them.

Waymo said on Saturday that it had temporarily suspended service in the city due to the blackout. It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.

“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”

The Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”

The blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.

Waymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully.

The blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.

A letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.

This post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In just about a week, iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes all filed for bankruptcy.

They’re very different companies — selling Roombas, lidar, and e-bikes, respectively — but as Sean O’Kane, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed on the episode of the Equity podcast, they faced some similar challenges, including tariff pressures, major deals that fell through, and a failure to establish themselves beyond the products that first made them successful.

You can read an edited preview of our conversation below, with Sean providing an overview of each filing, Rebecca weighing in on whether she has a Roomba, and me speculating about what the popular narratives about these bankruptcies leave out.

Sean: Rad Power is big for an e-bike company, but small, I think, in most people’s minds, since that’s still a bit of a niche. They were founded a long time ago and became popular even before the pandemic, and really were thought of as an industry leader, as far as quality of the bikes that they’re making, pretty good branding and marketing and trying to connect with with customers — which is really hard to find in the world of e-bikes, where most of them are just like alphabet soup companies on Amazon.

They rode that wave in the pandemic up high as micromobility really took off, and people were really rethinking how they were getting around, they weren’t commuting into the office as much. And we get glimpses of that in the bankruptcy filings. It only shows revenue back three years, but they were pulling in well over $100 million in revenue in 2023 — like $123 million, I think that fell to about $100 [million] last year, and through the bankruptcy this year, they were only at about $63 million, so they were clearly coming down off a pretty big high. They have a pretty diverse product lineup, but they just never really found a way to establish a foothold there.

And I think you could say similar things about these other two companies. Luminar is another company that was founded in the early 2010s, came out of stealth in 2017, and its mission was essentially to take lidar sensors, which at the time were really expensive and big and really only used in, like, defense applications and aerospace. 2017 was sort of the first big hype cycle of autonomous vehicles. They wanted to apply those sensors, make them more affordable for that use case. That helped them get some deals, most notably with Volvo, and then some other deals with Mercedes Benz, and a couple other players. But they were just heavily concentrated in that, and that was one of the reasons they wound up filing this week, too.

And then iRobot [was] the most well known of these three companies — a lot of people listening probably even have a Roomba at home or something very like it. It’s just another one of these situations where iRobot became synonymous with a certain thing, and then the advances in the technology that build that product move so quickly that they wound up in a situation where they were looking for a way out. And we all saw this, they were trying to get acquired by Amazon, and that deal got blocked by the FTC and so here we are.

They’re very different companies, but they all ran into similar problems. Do either of you guys have a Roomba?

Rebecca: No, I don’t have a Roomba. Those freak me out, but I bought my mom a Rad Power bike years ago, and she loves it. But now, you know, they had not only this bankruptcy issue, but they also had the issue with the batteries — they weren’t able to do their recalls because they were, like, “If we have to recall these bikes, we’re going to go bankrupt.” But they’re going bankrupt anyway!

I’m curious about the tariff thing, and how much this affected everyone’s bottom lines. You hear a lot on social media, people who are pro merger, how certain FTC blockings of [mergers] leads to the companies going bankrupt, or getting acquired by a Chinese firm rather than an American firm.

Sean: iRobot represents, to me, the sort of macro global trade problem of, could you have ever built this company here in the United States with a localized supply chain over the last 15 years? Probably not. And so it makes sense that they became so heavily reliant on China — which, let’s be real, probably led to the ability for these other companies to pop up and essentially copy what they did.

That reminds me of in Trump 1, when he flipped on tariffs for Chinese imports, and we saw a bunch of startups like Boosted Boards and other ones in the micromobility space get hit. So they’re contributing factors, for sure. The battery recall with Rad Power absolutely was, I think, a bigger dagger at the end, but the tariff stuff put them on uneven footing that made it harder for them to respond to stuff like that.

Anthony: A lot of times when a company fails, there [are] larger structural issues, and then there’s maybe a more immediate proximate issue. And particularly in the case of iRobot, I think that a lot of former executives and even outside commentators are pointing to this Amazon deal that was reached a few years ago — it kind of looked like the EU was not going to allow it to go through, and there is this sense of, “Okay, well, by blocking this deal, you’ve essentially put the dagger in their heart that eventually killed the company.”

That narrative also maybe ignores the fact that there were other things that caused them to want to get acquired in the first place.

The year in transportation started with a couple of bankruptcies — Canoo and Nikola — and now it’s ending with two more. Rad Power Bikes is coming to an end — or at least a bankruptcy. The electric bike company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days.

And then there is troubled lidar maker Luminar, which also filed for bankruptcy this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation.

The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of layoffs, executive departures, and a legal fight with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter Sean O’Kane reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy.

Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed emerged. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026.

The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by Waymo’s fast-paced growth, although Zoox and Tesla have also started to set up shop. This next year could be when we see these companies really squaring off in the same markets; it will also be the year when companies will face even greater scrutiny over safety and how robotaxis fit into daily life.

Meanwhile, EVs have had their struggles this year and automakers have struggled to adjust.

For instance, Ford is pivoting yet again. The company said this week it is ending production of the fully-electric F-150 Lightning as part of a broader companywide shake-up that will put more emphasis on hybrids and gas-powered vehicles. As part of its shift, Ford is turning to the increasingly popular “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. It’s also getting into the energy storage business — gotta do something with all those batteries — and says it is still committed to producing a midsized electric truck that will go on sale in 2027.

But hey, the EV is not dead. And the promise of smaller, more affordable ones are looming in the near distance with the imminent launch of Rivian’s R2 and Slate Auto’s electric truck.

Reporter Jagmeet Singh, who is based in India, always seems to have birds chirping in his ear about startup deals. The latest is Spinny, the Indian online marketplace for used cars.

Spinny is raising around $160 million, funds that will be used to acquire car services startup GoMechanic. TechCrunch learned the Series G round includes a mix of primary and secondary transactions and will value the 10-year-old startup at about $1.8 billion post-money.

Boatsetter and GetMyBoat, two companies that operate Airbnb-type business models for boats, agreed to merge.

Cowboy is back — sort of. The Brussels e-bike startup has been acquired by ReBirth Group Holding, a company that owns Gitane, Peugeot, and Solex. The e-bike startup had its buzzy moments but ultimately ran into problems, including a frame recall. The terms weren’t disclosed, but apparently it includes €15 million ($17.6 million) from existing shareholders.

Nirvana Insurance, an insurance tech startup focused on trucking, raised $100 million in a Series D funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. Lightspeed and General Catalyst also joined. Former TC reporter Mary Ann Azevedo had the scoop on the new valuation, which is now $1.5 billion.

Redwood launched a newly patented Battery Collection Bin designed to encourage consumers to recycle batteries. The system, which will launch in San Francisco, safely stores, packages, and monitors hundreds of batteries and battery-containing devices.

Rivian has added its branded “Universal Hands-Free” driving via a software update to its second-generation R1 EVs (not sure I am a fan of that term “universal hands-free,” btw). This upgrade will allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). Also in case you missed it over the weekend, senior reporter Sean O’Kane took us inside Rivian’s bet on AI-powered self-driving.

Securing America’s Future Energy has a new CEO. Avery Ash, SAFE’s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs and Special Initiatives, will become the organization’s next CEO.

Slate Auto, the electric truck startup backed by Jeff Bezos, said it has collected more than 150,000 refundable reservations for its low-cost EV due out at the end of 2026.

Sterling Anderson has been on the job at GM for six months and there is already chatter about him taking over as CEO once Mary Barra retires. My take: Anderson has big tasks ahead, so let’s all take a beat before assuming he’ll get that top post. GM president Mark Reuss is also in the wings.

Tesla has pulled its human safety monitors out of its robotaxis in Austin. The robotaxi service is limited with a fleet size numbering in the dozens. Still, it is a milestone. And for those wondering, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told me this week that Tesla has not applied for a driverless testing permit. The company only holds a permit to test autonomous vehicle technology with a human safety operator located behind the wheel.

Meanwhile, Tesla is facing a tricky situation in California. Here’s the gist: An administrative law judge agreed with the case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and ruled Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software. The DMV wanted to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its action, and a judge has agreed.

Ah, but wait. The DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to comply. That gives Tesla two options if it wants to keep those licenses: drop the Autopilot name or ship software to its cars that make them autonomous.

Some of you might not know that I am also co-host of Equity, a TechCrunch’s podcast about the business of startups. I generally co-host our Friday show, which offers commentary and analysis on the news of the week.

Every now and then I interview a founder or VC for the Wednesday show. My latest is an interview with Jiten Behl, partner at Eclipse Ventures and former chief growth officer at Rivian, who thinks we’re entering an era of major reindustrialization in the U.S. — one where factories run on AI-powered robots, not cheap overseas labor.  Check out the episode here.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Board of Trustees—or, if one prefers, the Board of Toadies—at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has renamed it the Trump-Kennedy Center. The 47th president of the United States approves. Donald Trump’s appetite for flattery appears as insatiable as the supply of bootlickers among his followers appears inexhaustible. He also blessed engraving his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace building and delivered a cartographic decree that the Gulf of Mexico would henceforth be called the Gulf of America.

Meanwhile, his secretary of defense, in between haranguing generals about physical fitness and ordering the U.S. Navy to engage in the killing of criminals without trial, has renamed the Department of Defense “the Department of War” (illegally, as it happens). Pete Hegseth has also gone about renaming bases that were once named after Confederate generals (traitors, the lot of them, and for the most part incompetent military leaders) but, last year, renamed after real heroes. The Hegsethian names are the same as the originals (Bragg, Hood, Lee) but supposedly refer to different people.

It is all offensive and in some cases skirts the will, such as it is, of a feeble and craven Congress. It is also puerile. The names will come back. In 10 years’ time, the maps will say “the Gulf of Mexico,” and the odds are good that a Democratic administration will yet again rename the Department of Defense and the forts. Trump’s name will be chiseled out of the walls, as will his embarrassing japes at his predecessors in his “President’s Walk of Fame” at the White House. So why do Trump and his minions do things that are childish in and of themselves, and that anyone with political judgment knows will be undone when their opponents eventually return to power?

“Names are powerful,” the exceptional magician Eugene Burger used to say, which is why some mentalists begin their acts by memorizing the names of everyone in the audience. The Confederate names on forts built during the early 20th century were designed to consolidate the myth of the Lost Cause, conferring nobility on what was, in fact, a sordid struggle for chattel slavery—the worst cause for which men ever fought, as Ulysses S. Grant later noted. And in some measure they succeeded.

Names can be tributes too, sometimes of a paradoxical kind. Native Americans were cheated, occasionally massacred, displaced, and defeated by Americans moving West. But in 1973 Jeep named its premier vehicle the Cherokee, hoping to capture ruggedness and pride in the name, even giving the first truck to the then-head of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The U.S. Army’s most lethal helicopter is the Apache, the Navy’s primary long-range missile is the Tomahawk, and a century ago William Tecumseh Sherman, one of the most formidable of Civil War generals, bore as his middle name that of one of the greatest Indian warriors Americans ever encountered.

One may debate whether such namings are appropriate—in 2021 the leaders of the Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation, a different federally recognized tribe, formally objected to having the name on a hulking car—but it is clear that they are intended to serve as a tribute. The renamings carried out by Trump and Hegseth are different. They are akin to the newly positive use of the word swagger and to the photo-shoot cosplay of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem or FBI Director Kash Patel in full tactical combat gear. They are childish.

Much of the leadership of the Trump administration, emphatically beginning at the top, exhibits the behavioral patterns of children—broken children, in many cases, who will never really become fully adult and do not understand what adult behavior is.

Children, particularly the adolescents whom the Trump leadership cadre most resemble, rarely have a strong sense of futurity. It is one of the reasons they so frequently do stupid things. The knowledge that what we do today may be undone tomorrow, that we cannot control the future to any large degree, that our ability to imprint our wishes on the world is limited—those are adult sentiments. The Romans would have a slave whisper in the ears of a Roman general during his triumphal parade, sic transit gloria mundi. Our equivalent, which only adults, or children becoming adults, understand, comes from Johnny Cash:

Adolescents often indulge in magical fantasies, dreaming about being able to manipulate a world that deep down they know is out of their control. That desire to shape their surroundings helps account for a fantastic belief in the power of names. To think that renaming an agency the Department of War can suddenly transform it is childish. Acknowledging the messiness of reality, its intractability, and the limits of what we can do about it is reserved for grown-ups.

Names are a useful way to be mean. Labeling the class nerd a doofus may make the class bully feel bigger than he is—for a little while. Until, that is, the nerd gets into a good college by swotting away at the books, or the doofus, after judo lessons, lands the bully on his back. Trump is a master of the insulting nickname, a tool he uses not only to cut down his opponents but also because he likes to wound. He enjoys the petty cruelty of it.

And to a particular kind of broken child, names can be a way of showing how clever you are in a similarly mean way. The Confederate names had been taken off the forts, but Hegseth no doubt feels that he has been very clever by, for example, restoring the name of Fort A. P. Hill using the last names or initials of Private Bruce Anderson, First Sergeant Robert A. Pinn, and Lieutenant Colonel Edward Hill—A. P. Hill, get it? One can practically see the smirks and elbow nudges and hear the “nyuck nyuck” of adolescent laughter. Hegseth wanted the Confederate names and, for now, got them in by the back door.

Malevolent children can be obnoxious, or even scary. But they are also pitiful creatures. The ones who never grow up will spend their lives hurting others—strangers, friends, and family alike—and usually themselves. They will never feel the weight of adult responsibilities and remorse or know the adult satisfactions and the adult joys. Some of them will forever have an emptiness inside them that they cannot fill. They will live with a deep anxiety that their frauds and cheats will be discovered and that, in the end, the magical names they have devised will be wiped away and the spells dissolved. Their brokenness will remain irreparable, their fears and unhappiness unassuageable. Unfortunately, though, they may grow up to be Cabinet secretaries, and who knows—perhaps even president of the United States of America.</div>

            <h2>Bowen Yang Broke Free on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/saturday-night-live-bowen-yang-final-sketch-episode/685375/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The final sketch of a Saturday Night Live episode is usually reserved for the show’s weirdest concepts. Airing in what’s known as the “10-to-1” slot, these bits evoke the feeling of a night gone a little too late. Think of Steve Martin and Bill Murray repeatedly wondering “What the hell is that?” at something off-screen, or a group of profane sloths reciting ridiculous “facts” about themselves in a digital short. These setups are bizarre, provocative, and often hit-or-miss.

But this weekend’s concluding sketch was more sentimental than absurd. In “Delta Lounge,” the cast member Bowen Yang played Ed, an old-school eggnog peddler completing his last shift and receiving a call from his partner, Ronda (the night’s host, Ariana Grande). The two launched into a duet of “Please Come Home for Christmas” before Ronda arrived at the airport just in time to help Ed bid goodbye.

The sketch doubled as a send-off for Yang, who’d announced earlier yesterday that he would be departing the show after that night’s episode. He was overcome with emotion as his character began talking about the job he was leaving behind. “I just feel so lucky that I ever got to work here, and I just wanted to enjoy it for a little bit longer, especially the people,” Ed said, holding back sobs. “I’ve loved every single person who works here, because they’ve done so much for me, especially my boss.” Cher, the night’s musical guest, then appeared as his manager—a larger-than-life cameo befitting Yang, a comedian who’d begun his tenure facing what seemed like outsize expectations.

In 2019, Yang became only the third cast member in Saturday Night Live history to be openly gay, and the first Chinese American performer in the program’s lineup. Yang has said he’s found these facts limiting: “There’s an idea that all of what I do is queer and Asian, which I don’t think is true,” he told Esquire earlier this month. “I get sick of people reducing the work I do on the show to those identifiers.” He covered a wide spectrum of roles: He could play a pygmy hippo gone viral, or J. D. Vance, or the mythical “evertree” that also worked as a lawyer. He could offer ridiculous takes on inanimate objects, such as a drone hovering mysteriously over New Jersey, or deepen a seemingly thin premise, as he did in a sketch about the couple featured in the choking-hazard poster, begrudgingly meeting their fans.

Yet his biggest contribution was a subtle sweetness. Yang’s go-for-broke characters tended to convey a vulnerability that’s hard to achieve in sketch comedy. Take, for instance, the iceberg that sank the Titanic and insisted on talking about his new album rather than the 100-year-old tragedy. His plea was tinged with a mix of guilt and frustration, making him unexpectedly sympathetic. Or consider Barry, the self-absorbed midwife so miffed to be forgotten by a colleague that he sows chaos in the delivery room: Yang, beneath a hilariously ever-growing wig, communicated through his body language Barry’s fear of not being taken seriously.

As a Chinese American viewer of Saturday Night Live, I’ll concede that I initially paid close attention to Yang’s performances because of the traits that made his casting so significant. But as time went on, I watched him because he made his identity appear not like a burden he carried, but like a joy he embraced. Terry Sweeney, the show’s first openly gay cast member, has spoken over the years about feeling pigeonholed during his single season; he was relied upon only to do impressions of female public figures or to deliver caricatures of his sexuality. Yang also played no shortage of such parts. But LGBTQ characters and performers have become more visible—and more dimensional—on the small screen in the decades since Sweeney was in the cast, and Yang was able to inject his roles with both personal specificity and wider resonance. The queer-coded slang—mentions of “poppers” and “twinks,” for example—in the Sara Lee sketch, in which he played a manager charged with disciplining a lustful employee who misused the company’s public Instagram, made its humor more nuanced. Yang’s mock competition with the actor Simu Liu, best known for being the first Asian star of a Marvel movie, poked fun at how goofy these milestones could sound, while also ribbing the expectations set by the model-minority stereotype. In other words, Yang drew from who he was, to his creative benefit.

His castmates channeled Yang’s own warm-but-boisterous brand of silliness last night, even in sketches from which he was absent—as in one where a group of squeaky-voiced Elf on the Shelf dolls discussed their trauma. The meta elements of Yang’s farewell appearance, meanwhile, resembled the many characters he embodied throughout his run, whose layers peeked through from underneath the farce. Comedy can sometimes seem antithetical to tenderness; it’s often easier for meanness to yield laughs, if the long history of roasts is any indication. But Yang unearthed sensitivity, helping the 50-year-old series, for which he earned five Emmy nominations, feel fresh. Like a 10-to-1 entry, he took unconventional swings. “I went into this being like, I’m just going to do whatever, and it kind of afforded me some latitude,” he told Vanity Fair last year. “That’s the whole point of the show: It’s a variety show.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Filing out of the family van, we saw snowflakes could float, dust-like, up from the monochrome rug that God had unfurled before Maranatha

Baptist Church. There, at eye level, they kept us for a second from seeing what we’d driven an hour to see,

a life-sized nativity, its figures arranged in semicircle, golden, exotic against the chapel whitescape. I watched

Mother Mary peer into the manger, her smile aglow in the vesper light, and caught myself wanting to worship

her just once without blasphemy, the way Joseph was, staring not down at the baby but over, into her, with a kind of awe

you can’t condemn. My parents looked so old and small next to them. Whose life was this size? Up close, the gold paint was scotched and chipping.

I could see arches and loops and whorls in the wood grain beneath. It took a while to realize there was nothing in the trough but powder.</div>

Did I miss anything? Russia is always strangely absent.

Russia supplies the liquidity, per Don Jr&#39;s testimony

Drones are plastics, motors, battery and computer chips.

Most people know the batteries are more expensive.  But most do not know that the motors are also surprisingly expensive to make in the US.

China took over that business when they started making toys and appliances.  It used to be unimportant and required labor not brains.

The plastic and the computer chips are not cheaper in China.

The plastic and the computer chips are not cheaper in China.

The chips definitely are. The plastic itself might not be, but making the moulds is.

Software is the biggest issue. DJI isn&#39;t just cheaper, they are better. Not just the flight software, the UI, the cameras, the radio link, the autonomy features.

Maybe you don&#39;t need or get as many drones North Dakota

Instead of 30 drones, North Dakota would be fine with two or three.

I don&#39;t care what intel China collects on me. What can they actually do with it? The US government is another story. They could easily declare me as a non citizen and have me disappear into a van.

The drones by themselves will not be able to reach China on their own. Anything coming from them that could be sent elsewhere would have to go through a cellphone app that runs the drone, and that&#39;s where the risk is.

And then there&#39;s the possibility that there&#39;s a kill switch implemented in the app, but that&#39;s the case with any drone hooked to a cellphone.

I say go ahead and ban them.  This notion of pervasive, constant, surveillance is a pernicious one.  While they are at it, ban chinese CCTV equipment too.

If the cost of surveilling is higher, police departments will be incentivized to use it more sparingly, and with cause.  I mean they used to use manned helicopters all the time. Remember when TV stations would show live video of chases?

Besides that, putting public money into local tech companies to make police drones isn&#39;t all that bad. Sure import Chinese

It&#39;s fairly easy to do a complete trace of all communication from a drone

If the US bans Chinese drones, China will probably respond by banning the export of drone motors. So America won&#39;t have any American drones either.

Almost as stupid as the Nexperia seizure. Always consider how the other party will respond.

CO2 liquifies at Room Temperature, air does not. CO2 has higher energy density. CO2 has a higher round trip efficiency.

CO2 can be turned into a liquid at roughly 30C (86F) when under pressure (about 70 bar). To turn air into a liquid, you must cool it to extreme cryogenic temperatures (around -196C). Liquid CO2 is roughly 400 times denser than gaseous CO2 at atmospheric pressure. Because it stays liquid at &quot;ambient&quot; (normal) temperatures, it can be stored in standard steel tanks without the need for massive refrigeration systems. CO2 transitions between gas and liquid so easily at moderate pressures, the system loses very little energy during the phase change. In a typical air-based system, much of the energy is lost as &quot;waste heat&quot; during compression. In the CO2 battery, that heat is captured and stored in &quot;thermal bricks&quot; and then used later to turn the liquid CO2 back into gas, making the cycle highly efficient.

Not enough CO2.  2000 tons seems like a lot, but the Lake Nyos disaster which killed people within 25km was a release of 100,000 to 300,000 tons of CO2.  A release of 2000 tons would be a major industrial accident but not an area-wide disaster.

The CO2 should have to escape through whatever opening is created, and ripstop is pretty standard for this sort of thing, keeping openings small.  A venting liquid CO2 tank would be limited by evaporation.The danger zone would depend on the size of the hole, but like old CO2 fire extinguishers, CO2 tends to disburse fast, and the lethal range for it is drastically higher than things like carbon monoxide, ammonia, and such.Plus, think of the future!  An EV would operate just fine, and a couple minutes would

If the CO2 is somehow released, it will not be possible to drive away from the accident because car engines require oxygen to burn fuel.Well, that, and because humans require oxygen to remain conscious.  If there&#39;s so little oxygen in the air that your car won&#39;t start, your car won&#39;t be the worst of your problems.OTOH your self-driving EV could perhaps evacuate your unconscious body from the area :)

Thanks for all the details!Something learned today.

Still, only the (re)compression all the CO2  will set you back a $22 per metric ton every time.And turbines aren&#39;t that efficient either.I wonder how much will be left when taking all the costs and inefficiencies into account.

CO2 can operate at ambient temperatures vs cryogenic requirements for liquid air. That’s a major advantage

I&#39;m curious about the &quot;thermal bricks.&quot; I can&#39;t think of a material with a higher specific heat than water, and the diagrams show water in the heat-exchanger areas.I&#39;m curious about this too. I don&#39;t understand the properties of CO2 but if you&#39;re compressing the gas, it heats up (PV=nRT). But you don&#39;t want to waste that heat, that&#39;s the energy you&#39;re trying to store. IIRC, condensing a gas to a liquid also releases heat so I don&#39;t understand the energy flows.

Reading the site page, it is closed cycle.  The big gas dome holds more or less atmosphere temperature and pressure CO2.  There are one or more tanks holding relatively non-cryogenic liquid CO2.When there is excess power, pumps liquify CO2 into the tanks.  When power is demanded, evaporating CO2 goes through a turbine to produce power, then into the dome.Water is used, most likely to cool the freshly compressed CO2, and warm expanded CO2 after the turbine.

But then if you let the CO2 out of the system and into the atmosphere, you are defeating the purpose of capturing it in the first place.

So re-process as much of the expelled CO2 as practical, since you already have it right there, turn it into calcium carbonate or something,The company site has a nice animation of how this works. It&#39;s a closed cycle: CO2 is never released into the atmosphere, it&#39;s just liquified and evaporated.To make sure everyone is clear, this is an energy storage system, not a generator. The power has to come from somewhere else, e.g. solar panels which are producing more energy than is needed during the day and less than needed at night.

Renewable energy at scale requires a mix of generation types, of storage types, of locations, of temporal phasing, etc etc. And that’s what we’re getting: for storage, we are getting short, medium and long term storage solutions using thermal, chemical, kinetic, gravitational and other mechanisms. This heterogenous approach lowers risks associated with single points of failure such as materials supply chain crunches or inability to meet demand spikes. It means a higher initial cost per kWh becau

I&#39;ve had some inside access to this tech in recent past. The main problem is efficiency. It&#39;s horrendous. You lose tremendous amounts of energy doing this, and you need quite a bit of energy to maintain the compressed state. We&#39;re nowhere near mainline chemical batteries in terms of efficiency numbers, and whatever numbers they&#39;re claiming on their website are likely specifically negating some critical losses. I&#39;ve seen efficiency numbers as low as 20-25%, through they can really struggle to push into upper

Quoting from the Google blog post linked in the summary,

The technology has already proven successful, having injected electrons into the Italian grid for more than three years, thanks to their commercial demo facility, and now with their full-scale 20MW-200MWh commercial plant.By supporting multiple commercial deployments of Energy Dome&#39;s technology globally, and making an investment in the company, we aim to bring this technology to scale faster and at lower costs.I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that if Google is investing in them, they&#39;ve probably done their due diligence and found it&#39;s real.

There have been successful prototypes of gas compression capacitors &quot;injecting electrons into the grid&quot; for much longer than that.

What matters isn&#39;t &quot;injecting electrons in the grid&quot;. What matters is doing this efficiently at low cost.

My entire point is that none of these sources, including this blog have a single word to say on the issue that matters. Instead they all focus on various language trick and creative wording to divert attention from thing that matters to things that don&#39;t.

Yes. We store is in steel tanks by cryogenically cooling it prior to compression so it doesn&#39;t go supercritical during compression. After compression is done, we just need to maintain subcritical temperature and pressure.

Basic physics time: do you remember that when you compress something, it heats up? So what happens to a gas that goes supercritical at around 30 celsius if you attempt to rapidly compress it into a liquid without doing extreme cooling on it before compressing it?

2000t generating 20MW over 10h... that&#39;s 2 milliion kg generating 720GJ.  Equivalent to lifting that 2000t by 36km.

This isn&#39;t gravity storage.  It liquifies the CO2 by pressurizing it.

According to Wikipedia, 2000t of CO2 can store 100MWh [wikipedia.org] which is 360GJ, half of the 720GJ I calculated above.  So that would be 20MW for 5h, not 10h.

So I guess I was right to be a bit skeptical, but am still surprised by how much energy can be stored.

Aren&#39;t these operations only considered efficient if the liquid COâ is a byproduct of another, much more expensive, operation?

Do we think they&#39;re doing this because there&#39;s some flaw in an existing California law where they can get credit for using  a former Linde facility as a &#39;battery&#39;?

It is a closed loop system.  Smallish tanks for the liquid co2, great big football field or larger dome for gaseous CO2.  Website does not have dimensions, I&#39;d guess the dome varies in size based on total energy desired.As such, it is like worrying about the inner loop water in a nuclear reactor.  Since you theoretically only need that initial charge, it rounds to zero per unit of energy over time.

            <h2>Trump Now Shares One More Thing in Common With History’s Worst Dictators</h2>

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected the idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

This week, meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Clint&quot; who told us he once worked as a consultant for a major Italian entertainment company.

&quot;A very unwelcome reorganization brought us a new boss,&quot; Clint told Who, Me? &quot;Although he was utterly incompetent, he had a complete faith in technology, and a fetish for physical security.&quot;

Clint said the new boss took less than a month to &quot;antagonize the whole office.&quot;

&quot;I remember him at lunchtime, locking up his office door, and ambling through the open plan section of the office with a telephone and a personal digital assistant both hanging from his belt,&quot; he told Who, Me? &quot;He thought he looked like a real pistolero,&quot; Clint wrote, but his colleagues thought he looked like a twit who mistakenly thought two kilograms of tech bouncing around his waist was cool.

The new boss liked to swagger out of the office at 3pm on Fridays, and when he did so Clint and his colleagues were ready.

“We opened his office and pasted his mouse on his desk with epoxy resin,” he told Who, Me?

&quot;The next Monday, he entered his office, powered up his computer and tried to move the mouse: The entire desk trembled and shook, but the pointer on the screen didn&#39;t move at all.&quot;

Clint said that after two or three attempts, the boss closed his office door and rang tech support.

&quot;We could hear him screaming on the phone, and we promptly and cowardly left the open plan area.&quot;

Clint later learned that the boss told the company&#39;s support team his mouse was faulty.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/22/south_korea_facial_verification/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">South Korea’s government on Friday announced it will require local mobile carriers to verify the identity of new customers with facial recognition scans, in the hope of reducing scams.

As explained in an announcement from South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT, the nation has a problem with criminals registering mobile phone accounts and then using them to run scams such as voice phishing.

The nation’s new policy therefore extends existing customer authentication arrangements, which see buyers required to present verifiable identity documents at the point of sale, to add verification of a facial scan.

South Korea’s three main mobile carriers – SK Telecom, LG Uplus, and Korea Telecom – each provide an app called “PASS” that stores digital credentials. This new scheme will see facial biometric info stored in that app used to verify identity.

The Ministry’s announcement of the scheme says it’s hoped the new verification requirement will make it much harder to register a mobile phone account using only stolen data.

South Korea has a population of almost 52 million and has experienced two major data theft incidents this year that impacted more than half of all residents. E-tailer Coupang leaked over 30 million records , an incident that cost its CEO his job.

SK Telecom, exposed data describing all of its 23 million customers.

Korean authorities have already fined SK Telecom $100 million after learning of the carrier’s woefully bad infosec practices, which included exposing plaintext credentials for its infrastructure on an internet-facing server. The telco also stored millions of user credentials without encryption in its database, making it easy for attackers to clone customers or add devices to their accounts.

The incident will now cost the carrier another $1.55 billion, after South Korea’s Consumer Dispute Mediation Commission on Sunday ordered the telco to compensate all 23 million customers to the tune of ₩100,000 ($67), half in the form of credits on their bills and the rest in loyalty points that can be used in many retail outlets.

No wonder South Korea now needs tighter procedures before allowing new mobile accounts.

Not all of the blame lies with SK Telecom, as the announcement of the facial verification requirement states that Mobile Virtual Network Operators registered 92 percent of counterfeit phones detected in South Korea during 2024. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">APAC in Brief Google and Apple last week started to allow developers of mobile applications to distribute their wares through third-party app stores and accept payments from alternative payment providers.

The tech giants made their changes in response to Japan’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).

Neither seems particularly happy about it.

Apple warned the law’s requirements “open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, and privacy and security risks.”

Cupertino has complied anyway, and said it introduced “Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization process for app marketplaces, and requirements that help protect children from inappropriate content and scams.”

Apple also dropped its App Store commissions to 10 percent “for the vast majority of developers.”

Google called for “constructive regulatory engagement and careful enforcement to avoid any unintended consequences as these new rules are rolled out.”

The company now offers Japanese users screens that let them choose a browser and search provider, and allows in-app purchases to be made using payment services other than the company’s Play payment scheme.

The Chocolate Factory also now lets developers “offer a side-by-side choice of making a purchase with Google Play Billing or completing the purchase on the developer’s website.”

AMD CEO Lisa Su last week visited China and, according to the nation’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said the US chip design firm “will continue to deepen its investment in China, further strengthen cooperation with China, and jointly promote industrial innovation and development.”

Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Lecheng said China continues to promote a new wave of industrialization and hopes AMD will participate in the opportunities that effort creates.

The Minister said he hopes AMD “will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market, innovating and growing together with upstream and downstream enterprises in the Chinese industrial chain to achieve mutually beneficial development.”

The President of Japanese brewer Asahi, which suffered a cyberattack and data leak in October, has said the incident was a management failure.

“We didn&#39;t pay enough attention to security measures, especially at the management level,” company president Atsushi Katsuki told Japanese outlet Nikkei. “There were governance issues about information security, which is something we&#39;re reflecting on.”

Katsuki said Asahi used NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework and had engaged third-party experts to simulate attacks. “Even so, we still had blind spots. If we had established a zero-trust communications environment earlier, we may have prevented it,” he admitted.

Linux distro Debian on Saturday announced its upcoming version 14, aka “Forky”, will support loong64 as an official architecture.

Loong64, aka LoongArch 64-bit, is a proprietary instruction set architecture developed by Chinese company Loongson. It blends MIPS and RISC- tech and is on the list of locally-developed chip tech Beijing encourages Chinese buyers to acquire.

Some of the Linux distros China promotes as an alternative to Windows are based on Debian.

The New York Stock Exchange last Friday twice suspended trading of Indian tech giant Infosys’s American Depositary Receipt shares, after the price jumped almost 50 percent.

Infosys issued a statement [PDF] in which the company said it is not aware of any material events that caused the sudden share price jumps.

The Indian company also announced [PDF] it had settled a class action related to the 2024 cybersecurity incident and data theft at its US operation Infosys McCamish Systems.

McCamish agreed to pay $17.5 million into a fund, to settle the matter.

Hong Kong’s Customs authority last week revealed it has conducted a territory-wide enforcement operation targeting pirate karaoke venues.

The sweep saw two men arrested for suspected breaches of Hong Kong’s Copyright Ordinance.

“With the Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement to resolutely combat different kinds of infringing activities to safeguard the rights of copyright owners,” Hong Kong Customs warned. ®

            <h2>Honey: all the news about PayPal’s alleged scam coupon app</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">PayPal’s Honey browser extension has been lauded for years as an easy way to find coupons online. But some are calling it a “scam” after a deep dive from YouTuber MegaLag, who accused Honey of “stealing money from influencers,” and returned one year later with a second video that says Honey targeted minors, collected data on people who never signed up for its service, and exploited small businesses.

The first video shines a light mostly on Honey’s use of last-click attribution, swapping its tracking cookie in for others’ when you interact with it. The second video tracks a series of emails between Honey and small businesses that lost revenue from its use of private coupon codes and how it attempted to squeeze them to sign up as partners, as well as its approach of sponsoring YouTubers with large audiences of younger viewers, like Mr Beast.

PayPal issued statements after the first video in 2024 saying that it follows “industry rules and practices” like last-click attribution. But creators who may have missed out on money because of it aren’t happy. Some YouTube channels, like Legal Eagle and GamersNexus, are now suing.

Below, you’ll find all our coverage of the controversy.

ESPN NBA writer Brian Windhorst points out that when Aspiration signed up to be the Clippers’ jersey patch sponsor (and, allegedly, help circumvent the NBA’s salary cap) it replaced another company.

That was Honey, the shopping tool exposed for swapping referral codes, which actually got ads featuring Kawhi.

Six months after the coupon hunting extension Honey was accused of cheating shoppers and influencers, it appears the PayPal-owned tool is still losing users. According to 9to5Google, the number of Chrome extension users continues to drop — at one point 20 million people used the extension. Now, that number is down to 15 million.

Google has updated its affiliate ads policy for Chrome extensions after creators accused PayPal’s popular Honey browser extension of being a “scam.”

Honey was accused of taking affiliate revenue from the same influencers it paid for promotion by using its Chrome extension to swap in its own affiliate link before you checked out. According to the updated Google policy posted today, this isn’t allowed in most cases:

The lawsuit joins other complaints filed since YouTuber MegaLag’s video accusing PayPal’s coupon-hunting Honey extension of hijacking affiliate links. The Legal Eagle channel filed one earlier this month as well.

The 90-minute video recaps the concerns raised in MegaLag’s original video and includes interviews with lawyers explaining the legal process.

Devin Stone of the YouTube Channel Legal Eagle is suing PayPal over the affiliate link practices of its Honey extension that were detailed by fellow YouTuber MegaLag last month, he announced in a video published Friday.

The proposed class action lawsuit was filed December 29th in California’s Northern District Court by Stone’s Eagle Team LLP and several other YouTubers’ businesses. It accuses Honey of intentionally replacing creators’ affiliate links with its own, even if it’s not offering shoppers a benefit, depriving creators of money in the process.

The PayPal Honey browser extension is, in theory, a handy way to find better deals on products while you’re shopping online. But in a video published this weekend, YouTuber MegaLag claims the extension is a “scam” and that Honey has been “stealing money from influencers, including the very ones they paid to promote their product.”

Honey works by popping up an offer to find coupon codes for you while you’re checking out in an online shop. But as MegaLag notes, it frequently fails to find a code, or offers a Honey-branded one, even if a simple internet search will cover something better. The Honey website’s pitch is that it will “find every working promo code on the internet.” But according to MegaLag’s video, ignoring better deals is a feature of Honey’s partnerships with its retail clients.

            <h2>Frozen Waymos backed up San Francisco traffic during a widespread power outage</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/848843/waymo-san-francisco-power-outage">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.

With street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.

A power outage struck San Francisco on Saturday that blacked out about 130,000 customers at its peak, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.

Some people posted videos of Teslas using their FSD feature to navigate the same streets, and Elon Musk tweeted that “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.” On Sunday evening, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion said, “We are resuming ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area.”

In response to an inquiry from The Verge, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion sent a statement overnight saying, “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work.”

PG&E reported as of 2pM PT that service for about 114,000 of the affected customers had been restored, as it continued repairs after a fire at a five-story power substation.

After this story was published, Philion sent a second statement Sunday evening:

We are resuming ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area. Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions. While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.

“Throughout the outage, we closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials. We are focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.

Exactly why the cars weren’t moving remains unclear, with no public updates we could find on the company’s social media channels, but speculation centered on spotty wireless data connections, with cell towers either down or overloaded by people who no longer had access to Wi-Fi, and/or the street lights that weren’t operating without power.

These problems have occurred before, though, as seen in TikTok videos from earlier this year showing Waymos frozen by a malfunctioning street light and during a power outage in Austin, Texas. In a reply to a Reddit post showing another similar situation last year, someone saying they were a former employee commented explaining that the vehicle would send a request to a remote assistant and wait for their response before proceeding.

According to a company blog post, it reaches out to a human response agent when the car encounters “unique interactions,” providing them with live and recorded views from its cameras in addition to a 3D map of what the sensors are picking up. However, those may require bandwidth that’s hard to find during a significant power outage. I couldn’t find any statistics on how many remote assistance operators Waymo has available at a given time, but in November, the company announced it passed a third-party audit by Tüv Süd, a German tech inspection company that evaluated its remote assistance program against industry best practices.

Update, December 21st: Added updated statement from Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion and updated information from PG&E.

Holiday shopping on a budget can feel constricting, especially if you’ve been invited to a white elephant or need a last-minute stocking stuffer. The good news is that, with this guide, you can leave that stress behind.

Whether you’re aiming for something practical or fun, we’ve found plenty of great gifts for under $25 — heck, we found several under $10 — that don’t scream “I bought this at the gas station on my way over.” You might not expect to find a worthwhile Nintendo Switch / iPad-compatible controller, a 4K-ready streaming stick, or a waterproof speaker in this guide, but here we are. And that’s just the start.

Your desk could probably use a fun distraction to help you unwind a little in the middle of the day. The Mini Buddha Board lets you create ephemeral sketches using water and the included brush. Once the water evaporates you’ll be left with a blank board to create a new work, no cleanup necessary.

8BitDo’s Micro is a pocket-friendly, 16-button wireless game controller compatible with iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch. It can make playing mobile games easier than tapping a touchscreen, and it’s perfect for playing NES, SNES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance titles on the Nintendo Switch.

A big roadblock to learning how stuff works is getting immediately bogged down by jargon. Author Randall Munroe sidesteps that in Thing Explainer by using the thousand most common English words to describe how bridges, data centers, helicopters, and the tectonic plates (and more!) work. The explanations are complemented by drawings that literally illustrate what’s going on.

SnapPower’s GuideLight can illuminate your dark hallway without permanently giving up an outlet to a nightlight. It replaces the cover around your duplex outlet receptacle and draws power by attaching its built-in prongs to screws on the side of your outlet. Once connected, the lights on the bottom of the GuideLight automatically turn on once it gets dark.

Finding the right video game to gift can be a challenge, but Paladone’s cartridge-shaped coasters are a fun alternative for fans of the 8-bit era. Each coaster features cover art from a popular game — whether it be Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, or Metroid — and can be hand-washed should a beverage spill on it.

Nobody should have to pay for a streaming service or cable just to watch live events like the Super Bowl, World Series, or Oscars. GE’s HDTV antenna can receive a TV signal from up to 40 miles away. Which channels you’ll get depends on your location, but CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS, and ABC are some of the most common stations that’ll be picked up over the waves.

Bentoheaven’s stackable bento box is slicker than most lunch bags. It comes with two large, 7.3-inch containers, a divider to help keep foods separated, and a smaller container for stashing snacks. The top container even has a compartment in its lid for utensils, and a velcro strap prevents the bento from opening in your bag.

A waterproof speaker should look good and sound good, too. Altec Lansing’s Mini H2O has an IP67 rating, floats when dropped in water, and has a built-in loop so you can attach it to a backpack with the included carabiner. The company claims its battery lasts up to six hours per charge. If you get two speakers, they can be paired together for stereo sound.

There’s nothing quite as nostalgic as building a Lego set. The 484-piece Medium Creative Brick Box contains the pieces you’ll need to make your own custom scenes, plus specific bricks to create Lego vehicles, animals, and other objects — including a windmill and toaster. The pieces come in a giant Lego brick-shaped bucket for easy storage.

Bluetooth earbuds are all the rage, but you’d be surprised how often a wired pair comes in handy. Apple’s EarPods have a surprisingly good microphone, never need to be charged, and should work with all your USB-C devices. An inline controller on the earbuds’ cable lets you change your volume and pause or skip tracks.

Using a physical notebook isn’t as convenient as dashing off quick ideas in your phone’s notes app, but putting pen to paper can feel more satisfying. Field Notes’ 48-page notebooks are pocket-friendly at 3.5 inches wide and 5.5 inches tall, and their graph paper makes them useful for sketching diagrams in addition to jotting down notes.

A wireless charging pad is a practical way to charge your gadgets without being tethered by a cable. Anker’s Qi2 15W MagGo pad is compatible with the iPhone, Android phones, or earbuds inside a wireless charging case. The pad snaps to your iPhone with magnets. For gadgets without magnets, the charging pad is large for easy alignment.

Bananagrams is a chaotic word game that can bring out the competitive side in anyone. The objective is to use tiles to create words that branch off of one another. The game is done once one player uses all of their tiles and the shared pool of tiles is empty.

A power bank is an essential travel gadget, and Baseus’ 22.5W model is feature-rich considering its low price. It has a built-in 8.6-inch retractable USB-C cable, so you’ll always have a cord with you, along with USB-C and USB-A ports to charge two more devices. Its 10,000mAh capacity is enough to fully recharge a smartphone with juice to spare.

GE’s 800-lumen Wi-Fi bulbs serve as a great entry point for making your home a little smarter. The color-changing LED bulbs work with Alexa and Google Assistant without a hub, and they support Matter for interoperability with Apple Home, making them a great choice if you’re unsure which smart home platform your giftee uses.

Staying hydrated is harder if your beverage spends most of the day sitting at room temperature. Hydro Flask’s 32oz tumbler is made from dishwasher-safe, BPA-free stainless steel, and it can keep beverages hot and cold for several hours. It’s big, but the tumbler’s tapered bottom can fit in car cupholders, and its handle makes it easy to carry.

Looking at your phone for directions while driving is very dangerous, but iOttie’s One Touch car mount can keep it at eye level for easy glancing when you really need to look. The suction cup mount has arms that grip your phone to prevent it from falling, and there’s even a cutout to hold your charging cable. It’s compatible with most smartphones — even larger devices like the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer like the colorful MOD (Home Edition) is key to helping break tasks into manageable, bite-sized chunks.

If you want to fix electronics instead of replacing them, you’ll need the right tools for the job. Kaisi’s 136-piece kit includes the spudgers, picks, tweezers, and screwdriver bits (111 of them!) to get inside gadgets and replace parts. The kit also has an anti-static wristband so you don’t accidentally short a motherboard with a shock.

A cast iron skillet is one of the few gifts that could last a lifetime. Lodge’s 10.25-inch skillet is big enough for cooking multiple burgers or pancakes at once, or baking biscuits or cornbread for a crowd. If you’ve never cooked in cast iron, remember not to soak it in water, and season it with oil fairly frequently.

If your TV struggles to run streaming apps well (or at all), consider Onn’s 4K Streaming Device. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and all your favorite apps via the Google TV interface, from Netflix and Disney Plus to YouTube. Recommendations are pulled from across services, and you can even use Google Assistant to search for shows and movies using your voice instead of the remote.

For older cars without built-in Bluetooth, get Scosche’s BTFM9, which can bring wireless music streaming to its speakers. It has USB-C and USB-A ports for charging gadgets and a Bluetooth transmitter inside. Once it’s paired to your phone, the BTFM9 can stream audio from your phone over an FM frequency picked up by your car’s radio antenna. It’s a simple, tool-free upgrade for almost any car.

Bachan’s Japanese Barbecue Sauce should be a staple in every household. The savory-sweet condiment is pretty atypical compared to American BBQ sauces, which often rely heavily on brown sugar or molasses for taste. Instead, Bachan’s recipe offers a nice balance of ginger, soy, mirin, green onion, and other Japanese flavors that work great if you’re trying to add a kick of umami to your next meal.

Everyone has felt the sinking feeling of losing their keys. Tile’s Mate is a Bluetooth tracker designed to fit onto your key ring. If you forget them, you can check the tracker’s location using an app to retrieve them. The Mate also has an SOS button you can push to subtly alert friends and family members you’re in an unsafe situation.

A multitool is a practical gift that won’t collect dust in a junk drawer. Gerber’s Dime has 12 tools, including wire cutters, scissors, nose pliers, two flat-head drivers, and a bottle opener. The Dime is only 2.75 inches long when closed, so it’s easy to carry in a pocket or keep in a car glove box.

This past year might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Groovy Glob, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

A smart plug adds functionality to an existing gadget rather than replacing it. Once the plug is connected to your Wi-Fi network and a gadget, you can turn it on and off using an app. TP-Link’s Tapo smart plug supports Matter, so you can add it to whichever smart home platform you use.

Having access to a spare headlamp is always a good idea, whether for grilling at night or sifting through an attic. The dirt-cheap Headlamp Pro might not be the brightest option available, but it runs on AAA batteries, carries an IPX4 weatherproof rating, and produces a 260-lumen beam that can illuminate up to 80 meters in front of you.

The Echo Pop is a compact smart speaker that’s perfect for a bedside table. You can use Amazon’s Alexa to set an alarm, play music, or control smart lights (and other accessories). If you have an Eero Wi-Fi router, the Echo Pop can extend the range of your network up to 1,000 feet. Read our review.

True globe-trotters know to keep a power adapter in their bag so they don’t end up with a dead phone in an unfamiliar area. Tessan’s 35W Universal Travel Adapter features five USB ports, a versatile AC socket, and three sets of retractable prongs that can be plugged into receptacles in more than 200 countries.

If you know a puzzler with a penchant for festive jigsaws, Galison’s Sparkling City might be the perfect gift. The 1,000-piece puzzle depicts a wintery scene with an ice rink, falling snow, a starlit sky, and trees covered with various holiday lights. The 27-by-20-inch puzzle also features foil accents, adding yet another festive touch.

A white noise machine can help you sleep or concentrate when silence is too boring, or when music or podcasts are too overstimulating. It can play 20 sounds, including blue noise, pink noise, rain or ocean sounds, or a fan. You can set the machine on a timer to turn off after one to four hours, or run continuously.

Hues and Cues is a board game that alternates between chill and absolute chaos. First, one player draws a card with a color on it and describes the color in a couple of words. Then, everyone else places their game piece on a board with 480 individual spaces, each with a different hue. Whoever guesses closest to the actual color scores points. It’s as simple as that.

No one should have to deal with a rat’s nest behind their desk when devices like Anker’s 2-in-1 USB-C cable exist. The handy USB-C cable splits at the end, giving you the ability to charge up to two devices from a single port. That means you can split power between a phone and tablet or juice a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in just 20 minutes using a single port.

Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most lauded Metroidvanias of all time. It’s an unrelenting game that requires patience, often requiring you to replay sections in an effort to learn how to defeat a boss or avoid a pesky hazard. You may have to take breaks, but the beauty of Silksong is that it often inspires you to give tough sections “just one more try.”

What’s the point of a clippable zip-up bag this small? Basically, you can use it to stash anything you would otherwise put in your pocket but fear slipping out. That includes chapstick, cash, cards, earbuds, you name it. Just be sure to leave the actual street tacos at your local tienda.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
