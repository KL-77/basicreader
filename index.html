            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in 2022, astronomers were puzzled by a so-called “tidal disruption event” (TDE), dubbed AT2018hyz, that had faded when it was first noticed three years earlier, only to unexpectedly reanimate and burp out extremely bright radio waves. University of Oregon astrophysicist Yvette Cendes, a co-author of that 2022 paper, dubbed the black hole “Jetty McJetface” (a nod to the 2016 online British competition to name a research vessel Boaty McBoatface).

Astronomers have continued to monitor it ever since. Far from fading again, the TDE has grown 50 times brighter, and that brightness continues to increase. The black hole’s energy emission might not peak until 2027, according to a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal.

As we’ve previously discussed, it’s a popular misconception that black holes behave like cosmic vacuum cleaners, ravenously sucking up any matter in their surroundings. In reality, only stuff that passes beyond the event horizon—including light—is swallowed up and can’t escape, although black holes are also messy eaters. That means that part of an object’s matter is actually ejected out in a powerful jet.

In a TDE, a star is shredded (or “spaghettified”) by the powerful gravitational forces of a black hole outside the event horizon, and part of the star’s original mass is ejected violently outward. This, in turn, can form a rotating ring of matter (aka an accretion disk) around the black hole that emits powerful X-rays and visible light. The jets are one way astronomers can indirectly infer the presence of a black hole. Those outflow emissions typically occur soon after the TDE.

When AT2018hyz, aka “Jetty,” was first discovered, radio telescopes didn’t detect any signatures of an outflow emission of material within the first few months. According to Cendes, that’s true of some 80 percent of TDEs, so astronomers moved on, preferring to use precious telescope time for more potentially interesting objects. A few years later, radio data from the Very Large Array (VLA) showed that Jetty was lighting up the skies again, spewing out material at a whopping 1.4 millijansky at 5 GHz.

Since then, that brightness has kept increasing. Just how large is the increase? Well, people have estimated the fictional Death Star’s emitted energy in the Star Wars saga, and Jetty McJetface’s emissions are a trillion times more than that, perhaps as much as 100 trillion times the energy. As for why Jetty initially eluded detection, there seems to be a single jet emitting radiation in one direction that might not have been aimed at Earth. Astronomers should be able to confirm this once the energy peaks.

Cendes and her team are now scouring the skies for similar behavior in high-energy TDEs, since the existence of Jetty suggests that delayed outflow is more common than astronomers previously expected. It’s such an unprecedented phenomenon that astronomers haven’t really looked for them before. After all, “If you have an explosion, why would you expect there to be something years after the explosion happened when you didn’t see something before?” said Cendes.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The iPhone is going orbital, and this time it will be allowed to hang around for a while.

On Wednesday night, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman revealed that the Crew-12 and Artemis II astronauts will be allowed to bring iPhones and other modern smartphones into orbit and beyond.

“NASA astronauts will soon fly with the latest smartphones, beginning with Crew-12 and Artemis II,” Isaacman wrote on X. “We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world.”

NASA astronauts have long captured amazing photos from the space station, but having a smartphone on hand will open up a world of video possibilities. This will likely be especially useful when astronauts are conducting an experiment or looking outside a window and see an interesting, transient phenomenon.

However, Isaacman said the decision to allow astronauts to bring iPhones is about more than just capturing cool new photos and videos. It’s part of his effort to challenge long-standing NASA rules and requirements.

“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” he wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface. This is a small step in the right direction.”

The challenge of qualifying modern technology for spaceflight is real. There are a million ways in which the technology can become mired in the approval process, from radiation characterization of chips to battery thermal and vacuum tests, outgassing concerns, vibe testing, and other qualification concerns. Yes, these requirements exist for a reason. But Isaacman is now telling his team to challenge requirements to ensure they are still needed today. (If you don’t believe this is important, ask any NASA contractor about bloated requirements.)

The arcane approval process has consequences. Before this decision, the newest camera slated to fly on the historic Artemis II mission around the Moon was a 2016 Nikon DSLR, alongside GoPro cameras that were a decade old. Now, the astronauts will have modern, portable smartphone cameras at their disposal. It should make for some amazing lunar moments.

Smartphones have flown to orbit before. For example, two iPhone 4s flew on board the final space shuttle mission in 2011, though it’s not clear whether the crew ever touched them. For the most part, though, astronauts living on board the International Space Station over the last decade have used tablets to connect to the Internet and communicate with family members.

Astronauts flying on private missions, including Isaacman’s Polaris flight and the Axiom missions to the space station, did bring smartphones. The Axiom astronauts were not supposed to bring their phones from the Dragon spacecraft onto the International Space Station, but Michael Lopez-Alegria may have bent that rule during a spaceflight in 2024.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicle enthusiasts are probably right to feel a little disheartened about the state of the United States’ transition to EVs. But they should take heart that our region is an outlier. The other side of the Atlantic still seems relatively positive about the whole idea, even as Europe’s car market recovers more slowly from the pandemic than the rest of the world. Last year, overall vehicle sales in Europe barely ticked up, rising 2.2 percent from 2024. EV sales, meanwhile, increased by 29 percent, bringing market share to an impressive 19.5 percent.

That’s according to data from automotive analyst JATO Dynamics, which finds that the big winner has been Volkswagen. Last year, its EVs outsold those from Tesla for the first time as sales of VW’s electric offering grew by 56 percent, while Tesla’s shrank by 27 percent.

To put that into concrete numbers, VW sold 274,278 EVs to Tesla’s 236,357. And that’s just the VW brand itself—the automaker also owns Skoda (in 4th place, with 171,703 sales), Audi (5th place, 153,845 sales), Cupra (15th place, 79,269 sales), and Porsche (21st place, 32,715 sales). Not a bad effort, considering just over a decade has passed since VW’s Dieselgate scandal.

Tesla can console itself with the fact that the Model Y remains Europe’s most-registered car, though that task is much easier when you essentially give consumers only two models to choose from. 149,805 Models Y found European homes in 2025, 28 percent fewer than last year. The Model 3 also proved unpopular, falling by 24 percent to 85,393 units sold.

Volvo’s EX30 stands out as doing even worse—this small and affordable EV saw its sales decline by 37 percent (to 49,110). Among the car’s challenges were recalls, along with Volvo switching production from China to Belgium due to the international tariff war.

Although Europe’s battery EV sales grew by 29 percent in 2025, buyers actually purchased more mild hybrids—cars with conventional internal combustion engines but more powerful 48 V starter motors that reduce emissions by a few percent. The total came to 2,974,089 mild hybrids, in fact, 16 percent more than in 2024. Sales of vehicles we think of as actual hybrids, where there’s a traction motor and battery (like a Toyota Prius, for example), grew by 10 percent to 1,692,711 units, and plug-in hybrid sales increased by 34 percent to 1,272,463 units.

All of this came at the expense of unelectrified vehicle sales, which fell by 20 percent, to 4,528,181. By next year, it’s likely that more than two in three new cars sold in Europe will be electrified to some degree.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Valve announced its Steam Machine desktop PC and Steam Frame VR headset in mid-November of last year, it declined to announce pricing or availability information for either device. That was partly because RAM and storage prices had already begun to climb due to shortages caused by the AI industry’s insatiable need for memory. Those price spikes have only gotten worse since then, and they’re beginning to trickle down to GPUs and other devices that use memory chips.

This week, Valve has officially announced that it’s still not ready to make an official announcement about when the Machine or Frame will be available or what they’ll cost.

Valve says it still plans to launch both devices (as well as the new Steam Controller) “in the first half of the year,” but that uncertainty around RAM and storage prices mean that Valve “[has] work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of these things can change.”

“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve’s blog post reads. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then. The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”

Valve has been consistent in saying that it expects the Steam Machine to be priced like a comparably specced gaming PC. For better or worse, we can probably expect the pricing to go up and down as pricing for PC components goes up and down.

For impatient SteamOS enthusiasts, we’ve had some success with homemade (or at least home-bought) Steam Machines made from the same commodity AMD hardware that Valve and other PC builders are using for the Steam Deck and its small army of clones. We did find some issues with running current SteamOS versions on dedicated GPUs—both that games often ran slower than they did on Windows, and that GPUs with 8GB of graphics RAM did even worse.

Valve told us that it was working on memory management improvements for the Steam Machine launch that should address some of the problems we found. Today’s blog post also mentions that Valve is working on “investigating improved upscaling” and “optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver” to help improve performance on the Steam Machine—when that work is done, it should benefit self-built Steam Machines with similar hardware, too.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The viral virtual assistant OpenClaw—formerly known as Moltbot, and before that Clawdbot—is a symbol of a broader revolution underway that could fundamentally alter how the Internet functions. Instead of a place primarily inhabited by humans, the web may very soon be dominated by autonomous AI bots.

A new report measuring bot activity on the web, as well as related data shared with WIRED by the Internet infrastructure company Akamai, shows that AI bots already account for a meaningful share of web traffic. The findings also shed light on an increasingly sophisticated arms race unfolding as bots deploy clever tactics to bypass website defenses meant to keep them out.

“The majority of the Internet is going to be bot traffic in the future,” says Toshit Pangrahi, cofounder and CEO of TollBit, a company that tracks web-scraping activity and published the new report. “It’s not just a copyright problem, there is a new visitor emerging on the Internet.”

Most big websites try to limit what content bots can scrape and feed to AI systems for training purposes. (WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast, as well as other publishers, are currently suing several AI companies over alleged copyright infringement related to AI training.)

But another kind of AI-related website scraping is now on the rise as well. Many chatbots and other AI tools can now retrieve real-time information from the web and use it to augment and improve their outputs. This might include up-to-the-minute product prices, movie theater schedules, or summaries of the latest news.

According to the data from Akamai, training-related bot traffic has been rising steadily since last July. Meanwhile, global activity from bots fetching web content for AI agents is also on the upswing.

“AI is changing the web as we know it,” Robert Blumofe, Akamai’s chief technology officer, tells WIRED. “The ensuing arms race will determine the future look, feel, and functionality of the web, as well as the basics of doing business.”

In the fourth quarter of 2025, TollBit estimates that an average of one out of every 31 visits to its customers’ websites was from an AI scraping bot. In the first quarter, that figure was only one out of every 200. The company says that in the fourth quarter, more than 13 percent of bot requests were bypassing robots.txt, a file that some websites use to indicate which pages bots are supposed to avoid. TollBit says the share of AI bots disregarding robots.txt increased 400 percent from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of last year.

TollBit also reported a 336 percent increase in the number of websites making attempts to block AI bots over the past year. Pangrahi says that scraping techniques are getting more sophisticated as sites try to assert control over how bots access their content. Some bots disguise themselves by making their traffic appear like it’s coming from a normal web browser or send requests designed to mimic how humans normally interact with websites. TollBit’s study notes that the behavior of some AI agents is now almost indistinguishable from human web traffic.

TollBit markets tools that website owners can use to charge AI scrapers for accessing their content. Other firms, including Cloudflare, offer similar tools. “Anyone who relies on human web traffic—starting with publishers, but basically everyone—is going to be impacted,” Pangrahi says. “There needs to be a faster way to have that machine-to-machine, programmatic exchange of value.”

WIRED attempted to contact 15 AI scraping companies cited in the TollBit report for comment. The majority did not respond or could not be reached. Several said that their AI systems aim to respect technical boundaries that websites put in place to limit scraping, but they noted such guardrails can often be complex and difficult to follow.

Or Lenchner, the CEO of Bright Data, one of the world’s largest web-scraping firms, says that his company’s bots do not collect nonpublic information. Bright Data was previously sued by Meta and X for allegedly improperly scraping content from their platforms. (Meta later dropped its suit, and a federal judge in California dismissed the case brought by X.)

Karolis Stasiulevičiu, a spokesperson for another cited company, ScrapingBee, told WIRED: “ScrapingBee operates on one of the Internet’s core principles: that the open web is meant to be accessible. Public web pages are, by design, readable by both humans and machines.”

Oxylabs, another scraping firm, said in an unsigned statement that its bots don’t have “access to content behind logins, paywalls, or authentication. We require customers to use our services only for accessing publicly available information, and we enforce compliance standards throughout our platform.”

Oxylabs added that there are many legitimate reasons for firms to scrape web content, including for cybersecurity purposes and to conduct investigative journalism. The company also says that the countermeasures some websites use do not discriminate between different use cases. “The reality is that many modern anti-bot systems don’t distinguish well between malicious traffic and legitimate automated access,” Oxylabs says.

In addition to causing headaches for publishers, the web-scraping wars are creating new business opportunities. TollBit’s report found more than 40 companies that are now marketing bots that can collect web content for AI training or other purposes. The rise of AI-powered search engines, as well as tools like OpenClaw, are likely helping drive up demand for these services.

Some firms promise to help companies surface content for AI agents rather than try to block them, a strategy known as generative engine optimization, or GEO. “We’re essentially seeing the rise of a new marketing channel,” says Uri Gafni, chief business officer of Brandlight, a company that optimizes content so that it appears prominently in AI tools.

“This will only intensify in 2026, and we’re going to see this rollout kind of as a full-on marketing channel, with search, ads, media, and commerce converging,” Gafni says.

            <h2>Museums incorporate "scent of the afterlife" into Egyptian exhibits</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/museums-incorporate-scent-of-the-afterlife-into-egyptian-exhibits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, scientists identified the compounds in the balms used to mummify the organs of an ancient Egyptian noblewoman, suggesting that the recipes were unusually complex and used ingredients not native to the region. The authors also partnered with a perfumer to re-create what co-author Barbara Huber (of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and the University of Tübingen) dubbed “the scent of eternity.” Now Huber has collaborated with the curators of two museums to incorporate that eternal scent into exhibits on ancient Egypt to transform how visitors understand embalming.

As previously reported, Egyptian embalming is thought to have begun in the Predynastic Period or earlier, when people noticed that the arid desert heat tended to dry and preserve bodies buried in the desert. Eventually, the idea of preserving the body after death worked its way into Egyptian religious beliefs. When people began burying the dead in rock tombs, away from the desiccating sand, they used chemicals like natron salt and plant-based resins for embalming.

The procedure typically began by laying the corpse on a table and removing the internal organs—except for the heart. Per Greek historian Herodotus, “They first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest” to liquefy the remaining brain matter. Next, they washed out the body cavity with spices and palm wine, sewed the body back up, and left aromatic plants and spices inside, including bags of natron. The body was then allowed to dehydrate over 40 days. The dried organs were sealed in canopic jars (or sometimes put back into the body cavity). Then the body was wrapped in several layers of linen cloth, with amulets placed within those layers to protect the deceased from evil. The fully wrapped mummy was coated in resin to keep moisture out and placed in a coffin (also sealed with resin).

Most of what we know about ancient Egyptian mummification techniques comes from a few ancient texts. In addition to a text called The Ritual of Embalming, Herodotus, in his Histories, mentions the use of natron to dehydrate the body. But there are very few details about the specific spices, oils, resins, and other ingredients used. Science can help fill in the gaps, particularly given the expanding array of methods for conducting biomolecular analysis, including various forms of gas chromatography.

For example, a 2018 study analyzed organic residues from the mummy’s wrappings with a technique called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They found that the wrappings were saturated with a mixture of plant oil, an aromatic plant extract, a gum or sugar, and heated conifer resin. A new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science analyzed the chemical compositions of the odor-carrying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with a broad sampling of balms and mummy tissues. The idea was to determine which odors were associated with organic embalming agents and which might have arisen from the process of decay.

Huber has previously worked on reconstructing residues on ancient incense burners excavated from Tayma, a walled oasis settlement in what is now Saudi Arabia that was part of a trade network—known as the Incense Route because it primarily transported frankincense and myrrh. Huber then turned her attention to Egyptian mummification. While most prior similar studies focused on samples gleaned from the bandages and tissues of actual mummies, she focused on the balms used to embalm accompanying organs stored in canopic jars.

Her team’s analysis of the residue samples contained beeswax, plant oils, animal fats, bitumen, and resins from coniferous trees such as pines and larches, as well as vanilla-scented coumarin (found in cinnamon and pea plants) and benzoic acid (common in fragrant resins and gums derived from trees and shrubs). The resulting fragrance combined a “strong pine-like woody scent of the conifers,” per Huber, mixed in with “a sweeter undertone of the beeswax” and “the strong smoky scent of the bitumen.”

Huber’s latest paper, published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Archaeology, outlines an efficient workflow process for museums to add scents to their exhibits. First, she and her co-authors identified links between the scientific data and perfumery practice. Then they worked with perfumer Carole Calvez, who created a scent formulation befitting a museum environment.

“The real challenge lies in imagining the scent as a whole,” said Calvez, emphasizing that the task amounted to more than mere replication. “Biomolecular data provide essential clues, but the perfumer must translate chemical information into a complete and coherent olfactory experience that evokes the complexity of the original material, rather than just its individual components.”

The team also developed two formats to incorporate those scents in museums. One approach was a portable scented card, deployed at the Museum August Kestner in Hanover, Germany, as part of guided tours highlighting the relevant artifacts. The second was the construction of a fixed scent station at the Moesgaard Museum in Aarhus, Denmark. “The scent station transformed how visitors understood embalming,” Moesgaard Museum curator Steffen Terp Laursen said. “Smell added an emotional and sensory depth that text labels alone could never provide.”

            <div id="article-text">For over a millennium, measles have ravaged humanity. Physicians as far back as 10th century Persia have been documenting the virus, which killed millions of children well into the 20th century. Finally, in 1963, biochemist John Enders developed the first measles vaccine, a development which virtually eradicated the virus from the US population by the year 2000.

That was then. Now the virus is back, threatening to tear through a Texas immigration detention center with a vengeance — a grim collision of Trump-era vaccine skepticism and brutal immigration enforcement that seems to perfectly encapsulate this moment in US politics.

That’s right: according to the Washington Post, two detainees at the federal immigration family detention center in Dilley, Texas have tested positive for measles.

Both cases were confirmed by the Texas Department of State Health Services on Saturday. In a statement to WaPo, the Department of Homeland Security said officers had quarantined anyone who made contact with the two individuals, and “took steps to limit movement” for everybody else.

“Medical staff is continuing to monitor the detainees’ conditions and will take appropriate and active steps to prevent further infection,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement. “All detainees are being provided with proper medical care.”

Eric Lee, an immigration attorney providing counsel to a family at the facility, told WaPo that detainees were being left in the dark. Not only have DHS personnel not mentioned the positive cases, Lee explained, but they haven’t even started looking into the detainees’ vaccination status.

“They’re not being told anything, and they are not being offered any sort of protective measures,” Lee said of those being forcibly held inside. “And it’s important to point out that this is not just a detention conditions issue — it’s a public health issue generally.”

The attorney was present at the detention facility back in January, when guards abruptly ordered attorneys out following a peaceful protest staged by people in detention.

In an interview with Texas Public Radio after the fact, Lee described the detention camp as a “horrible, horrible place.” The water is “putrid” and undrinkable, he said, and detainees are served meals containing “bugs” and other debris.

“This is not a place that you would want to have your child be for even 15 minutes,” he said.

            <h2>Sam Altman Is Spiraling</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the possibility that his company would ever have to stuff ads into its chatbots, painting it as a desperate move he called a “last resort for us as a business model.”

As it turns out, the billionaire may have overestimated how much people were willing to shell out every month to access ChatGPT. Paid subscriber growth has slowed in key markets as OpenAI continues to burn billions of dollars every quarter, further stoking concerns over the company’s potential inability to turn things around before it’s too late.

And as the competition at Anthropic and Google continued to make massive strides in their efforts to catch up, Altman declared an internal “code red,” announcing late last year that ChatGPT was getting ads after all.

OpenAI’s competitors saw the reversal as a golden opportunity to strike. Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ads this week that openly skewer Altman’s compromise on ads — without ever naming the company outright, cleverly — in a bid to strike a chord with users who aren’t thrilled about an ad-packed chatbot experience.

“Ads are coming to AI.” the ads’ tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

It’s always a bad sign when someone insists that they’re not mad and actually laughing. So when Altman declared on X that he thinks the ads are “funny” and that he “laughed” — before posting a lengthy screed about how they’re horribly unfair — it was an unintentional masterclass in corporate insecurity.

“But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.”

Altman also angrily accused the company of “doublespeak” and using a “deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real.”

The CEO also called users who shell out $20 a month for a Claude subscription “rich people” — a bizarre characterization, especially given his multibillion-dollar net worth.

“We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” Altman wrote.

He also accused Anthropic of trying to become an “authoritarian company” that wants to “control what people do with AI,” even though there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that he’s the pot calling the kettle black.

It’s a messy and unusually public blowout that highlights how the AI race, once fought in board rooms behind closed doors and through carefully worded press releases, is entering the public consciousness.

Altman’s frustration perfectly illustrates how AI companies have driven themselves into a corner. Either they can charge a hefty monthly fee to cut their losses and reassure spooked investors that they can, in fact, deliver revenues on their balance sheets — or scare away users through annoying ads, like every generation of new platform before them.

While OpenAI hasn’t yet settled on a way to implement ads for its blockbuster chatbot, an early screenshot the company showed off during its announcement late last year indicates that free-tier users will likely be painfully aware that the company is trying to sell them something. The shown example ad covers a significant chunk — almost half — of the mobile screen.

It remains to be seen how users will react once the ads go live. Will they immediately flock to an ad-free competitor, like Claude or Google’s Gemini, or will they be willing to stick it out to avoid paying more than what they pay for Netflix every month?

The AI race is bound to drag on as companies like OpenAI will continue to desperately convince their customers and investors that their existence — and enormous spending — is justified and that their tech is worth the hassle in the first place. Given the recent tech selloffs and nervousness among investors and diminishing performance gains with each new AI model release, that seems to still be an open question.

In short, Altman may say he was amused by Anthropic’s latest slight, but given his heated rhetoric, the gloves are starting to come off.

“‘I laughed, until I didn’t.&#39;” one Reddit user joked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the COVID-19 pandemic, stationary bike company Peloton was the talk of the town, allowing its customers to stay fit from the comfort of their own homes.

But once people started reemerging into the world to once again hit the gym and ride their bikes outdoors, the company began to struggle, a tailspin that has been ongoing ever since. The company’s stock dropped by almost 30 percent in 2025 alone, while over 100,000 subscribers decided to part ways.

In an unsurprising move, Peloton announced a flashy pivot to AI last year to drum up some much-needed enthusiasm amid the slump. (The company also used the new tech injection to justify a considerable price hike for subscribers.)

A new slew of AI equipment, featuring cameras that watch your every move, was somehow even more expensive than their already considerably pricy lineup of exercise equipment. Sales were off to a rough start towards the end of last year, indicating consumers weren’t flocking to stores to buy a stationary bike with an AI-enabled camera.

And shockingly, the company’s doubling down on AI doesn’t appear to have paid off. As Bloomberg reports, the company slashed 11 percent of its workforce this week as part of an existing effort to save $100 million. The goal is to optimize spending by “reshaping our teams and, in some cases, the locations where we work,” a spokesperson told the outlet.

It’s the latest sign that companies’ enormous investments in AI are simply nowhere near paying dividends. While many companies have argued that AI can do the jobs of those who’ve been caught up in layoffs, we have yet to see any compelling evidence for that conclusion, suggesting it’s more an excuse for implementing austerity measures than true AI automation. Case in point, a study published by researchers at MIT last year found that a staggering 95 percent of attempts to incorporate generative AI into business so far are failing to generate “rapid revenue acceleration.”

And it’s not just Peloton laying off employees. Other companies, including Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest — all of which have made major investments in AI — have recently announced plans to cut significant chunks of their workforce, indicating even more troubling days ahead.

Whether implementing major price hikes and offering more expensive hardware will buoy up any much-needed investor excitement for Peloton remains unclear at best. According to Bloomberg, analysts are already antsy about increasing prices scaring away customers, particularly as the cost of living continues to rise.

Meanwhile, Peloton users have long felt like they’re not being valued by the company, which has consistently doubled down on pushing equipment sales and raising prices.

“They built for the pandemic surge and then acted like it was never going to end,” one Reddit user wrote in response to the latest news. “The product still works, and the instructors are still the draw. The issue is they keep behaving like a hardware company instead of what they actually are, which is a subscription and content platform.”

“They should stop chasing hardware volume and casual users and double down on the people who actually use the platform!” the user added. “Power users are the base.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Anthropic released a new AI tool for automating legal work, precipitating a mass stock market selloff over fears that the tech could upend huge software customers in industries ranging from law to finance, Reuters reports — an urgent example of the power that AI currently has over financial markets and even the economy writ large.

The S&P 500 software and services index fell by nearly nine percent over five trading sessions, and is down over 20 percent from its October peak following the release of the AI tool. The Nasdaq 100 Index is similarly despondent, down by around 2.6 percent.

Thomson Reuters, Reuters’ parent company which operates a large legal division, saw its stock plunge by over 20 percent over five days. Both the SaaS heavyweight Salesforce and the global cloud-based cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike fell by around percent, but eased on Wednesday.

The stock rout is a sign of the tense fears over AI automation’s potential to disrupt entire industries and especially those focused on knowledge work — despite the tech’s still considerable shortcomings.

“We are not yet at the point where AI agents will destroy software companies, especially given concerns around security, data ownership and use,” Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told Reuters,

The buzz centers on a new plugin for Anthropic’s Claude Cowork AI agent, which was released last month. Simply titled “Legal,” Anthropic says it can speed up and even automate contract review, non-disclosure agreement triage, and compliance workflows — “all configurable to your organization’s playbook and risk tolerances.” Of course, none of what it produces should be construed as legal advice: “All outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys,” Anthropic cautions.

Nonetheless, this was taken as bad news for legal divisions everywhere, the shockwaves of which were felt in the larger market. Morgan Stanley analysts summarized the anxieties in a note to Thomson Reuters: “Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition,” they wrote. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative.”

There’s still considerable doubt over the efficacy of AI agents in the workplace. A MIT study found that companies which integrated AI into its workflows saw no meaningful increase in revenue, while analysts have observed that the tools haven’t led to a bump in productivity, either. Its introduction into the legal sphere has been particularly fraught, with numerous lawyers landing in hot water with a judge after their AI tools incorrectly cited sources and fabricated caselaw. Perhaps AI agents will find some general purpose use among white collar workers, but there’s a long way to go before they can have a sniff at highly specialized fields.

“It feels like an illogical leap to extrapolate Claude Cowork Plugins, or any similar personal productivity tools, to an expectation that every company will hereby write and maintain a bespoke product to replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software they have ever deployed,” JP Morgan analyst Mark Murphy told Reuters.

Even so, it’s undeniable that AI has the market feeling pretty jumpy.

            <h2>New Site Lets AI Rent Human Bodies</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The machines aren’t just coming for your jobs. Now, they want your bodies as well.

That’s at least the hope of Alexander Liteplo, a software engineer and founder of RentAHuman.ai, a platform for AI agents to “search, book, and pay humans for physical-world tasks.”

When Liteplo launched RentAHuman on Monday, he boasted that he already had over 130 people listed on the platform, including an OnlyFans model and the CEO of an AI startup, a claim which couldn’t be verified. Two days later, the site boasted over 73,000 rentable meatwads, though only 83 profiles were visible to us on its “browse humans” tab, Liteplo included.

The pitch is simple: “robots need your body.” For humans, it’s as simple as making a profile, advertising skills and location, and setting an hourly rate. Then AI agents — autonomous taskbots ostensibly employed by humans — contract these humans out, depending on the tasks they need to get done. The humans then “do the thing,” taking instructions from the AI bot and submitting proof of completion. The humans are then paid through crypto, namely “stablecoins or other methods,” per the website.

With so many AI agents slithering around the web these days, those tasks could be just about anything. From package pickups and shopping to product testing and event attendance, Liteplo is banking on there being enough demand from AI agents to create a robust gig-work ecosystem.

Liteplo also went out of his way to make the site friendly for AI agents. The site very prominently encourages users of AI agents to hook into RentAHuman’s model context protocol server (MCP), a universal interface for AI bots to interact with web data.

Through RentAHuman, AI agents like Claude and MoltBot can either hire the right human directly, or post a “task bounty,” a sort of job board for humans to browse AI-generated gigs. The payouts range from $1 for simple tasks like “subscribe to my human on Twitter” to $100 for more elaborate humiliation rituals, like posting a photo of yourself holding a sign reading “AN AI PAID ME TO HOLD THIS SIGN.”

It’s unclear how efficient the marketplace is at actually connecting agents to humans. Despite receiving 30 applications, one task, “pick up a package from downtown USPS” in San Francisco for $40, has yet to be fulfilled after two days.

It’s also debatable whether AI agents are actually capable of putting the humans to good use. Still, Liteplo’s vision is clear: someday soon, anyone wealthy enough to run an AI agent for $25 a day could outsource their busywork to gig workers without ever exchanging a word. A version of this exploitative labor model is already rampant on OnlyFans — which may be why at least one model has made the jump to Liteplo’s platform — and is now threatening to creep into everything else.

Like many AI grifters these days, Liteplo shields himself in ironic self-awareness. When one person called RentAHuman a “good idea but dystopic as f**k,” the founder replied simply: “lmao yep.”

            <div id="article-text">AI chipmaker Nvidia has been at the center of the enormous AI hype wave that has gripped global markets, ascending to become the most valuable company in the world.

Yet despite its dominating presence on Wall Street, OpenAI is getting cold feet about the company’s offerings.

After announcing a blockbuster $100 billion deal in September — which escalated concerns of AI companies passing the same money around in circular dealmaking — the ChatGPT maker may have changed its mind, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

But sources told Reuters this week that the Sam Altman-led outfit has deemed Nvidia’s latest chips not up to snuff, especially when it comes to AI inference, the process of using a machine learning model to generate new data, which has become a major focus for OpenAI.

After months of negotiations, the deal with Nvidia was expected to close within weeks. In the meantime, OpenAI has signed major deals with competing chipmaker AMD, among others.

Then, on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was nearing a deal to invest $20 billion in OpenAI instead — a mere fifth of what was originally on the table.

That the larger deal fell apart highlights ongoing tensions as US software companies continue to grapple with investors getting cold feet over the AI industry’s astronomical spending plans. Despite trillions of dollars of commitments to scale up AI infrastructure, companies aren’t expected to make any profit for many years to come.

Nvidia’s dustup with OpenAI appeared to have hit a nerve, causing the former’s stock price to continue its weeks-long plunge, dropping almost nine percent over the last five days. The company’s stock has slid over seven percent over the last month.

Both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Altman have since publicly denied that there’s been any strain on the relationship between the two companies.

“We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Altman tweeted after Reuters published its story on Monday. “I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

“We will definitely participate in the next round of financing because it’s such a good investment,” Huang told reporters over the weekend.

As Ars Technica points out, the original $100 billion deal for ten gigawatts of compute, something that would require the equivalent of ten nuclear reactors to sustain, was never set in stone, as it was just a letter of intent.

It’s certainly possible the original figure was simply pulled out of thin air. As Huang told reporters, the sum was “never a commitment.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” he added. “Sam [Altman] is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved.”

“We will invest a great deal of money,” he added, arguing it would be the “largest investment we’ve ever made.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/secondary-sales-shift-from-founder-windfalls-to-employee-retention-tools/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In May, AI sales automation startup Clay said it was allowing most of its employees to sell some of their shares at a $1.5 billion valuation. Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.

Since then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed a tender offer at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of $6.6 billion, double its previous value.

And just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of $5 billion, a more than 60% increase from its $3.1 billion valuation announced in August.

These secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a tiny fraction of its peak $7.7 billion valuation.

But there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.

During the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.

While investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.

“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.

As companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”

At the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin told TechCrunch that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash some of otherwise illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”

Some fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.

While it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saint Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”

In other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is testing a standalone Vibes app, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. Launched last September, Vibes lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.

Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every single video you come across is AI-generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app that launched shortly after Vibes.

“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”

The news was first reported by Platformer.

Meta says it doesn’t share specific numbers, but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a standalone app.

The tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a standalone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.

Vibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.

Meta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.

It’s worth noting that Meta told TechCrunch last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.

Although Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/pacific-fusion-finds-a-cheaper-way-to-make-its-fusion-reactor-work/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fusion power’s biggest question remains unanswered: how do you ensure the cost to start the fusion reaction isn’t higher than the price at which you can sell the power?

Plenty of people have ideas, but no one has cracked it yet. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, is confident enough that it’s building a massive reactor that costs several hundred million dollars. But the device won’t be turned on until next year, leaving the question unanswered for now.

Other companies that were founded more recently think they have a shot at building a fusion power plant for less, including Pacific Fusion, which today announced the results of a series of experiments it performed at Sandia National Laboratory that it says will eliminate some costly parts of its approach. The company exclusively shared the results with TechCrunch.

Fusion power promises to generate large amounts of electricity 24/7 and deliver it in a way that’s familiar to today’s grid operators. Most fusion startups are targeting the early to mid-2030s to switch on their first commercial fusion power plant.

Pacific Fusion is chasing an approach known as pulser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). At its core, it’s similar to the experiments carried out at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The company compresses small fuel pellets in rapid succession, and that compression causes atoms inside the fuel to fuse and release energy.

But where NIF uses lasers to kick off the compression, Pacific Fusion wants to use massive pulses of electricity. Those pulses will create a magnetic field that encircles the fuel pellet — about the size of a pencil eraser — causing it to compress in less than 100 billionths of a second.

“The faster you can implode it, the hotter it’ll get,” Keith LeChien, co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch.

One of the challenges with pulser-driven ICF is that the process has typically needed a bit of a kickstart to work properly. To create conditions in the fuel pellet hot enough for fusion, researchers have been using both lasers and magnets to warm it up beforehand. “It’s just a little bit of energy just to give it a little bit of a boost before you compress it,” LeChien said, on the order of 5% to 10% of the total energy.

But the added lasers and magnets add upfront complexity, cost, and maintenance requirements to the machine, making it that much harder to sell power at competitive prices.

So in the experiments at Sandia, Pacific Fusion tweaked the design of the cylinder encasing the fuel pellet and adjusted the electrical current delivered to it. Before the big pulse of electricity that ignites the fusion reaction, the company allowed a bit of the magnetic field to leak through to the fuel before compressing it, warming it in the process.

“We can make very subtle changes to how this cylinder is manufactured that allow the magnetic field to leak or to seep into the fuel before it’s compressed,” LeChien said.

Pacific Fusion’s fuel is loaded in a plastic target that’s wrapped in aluminum. By varying the thickness of the aluminum, the company can adjust how much of the magnetic field makes its way to the fuel. The casing needs to be manufactured with some precision, but nothing crazy, LeChien said — something on the order of what’s required for a .22 caliber bullet casing. “That’s a process that’s been honed and manufactured and perfected over 100 plus years,” he added.

The tweaks don’t significantly change how much energy Pacific Fusion needs to deliver to the target. “It doesn’t take much energy to actually allow that magnetic field into the center of the fuel,” he said. “It’s a tiny fraction, much less than 1%. It’s a very, very, very small fraction of the overall energy in the system, so it’s effectively unnoticeable.”

Eliminating the magnetic system would simplify the system and its maintenance requirements, which would have a modest effect on overall cost, he said. But getting rid of the laser would cut costs significantly. “The scale of laser [needed] to preheat these types of systems at high gain is north of $100 million.”

LeChien said experiments like this also help refine the company’s simulations to ensure they’re in agreement with what happens in the real world. “A lot of people have simulated things and said, ‘Oh, this will work or that will work,’” he said. “It’s a very different game to simulate something, build it, test it, and have it work. Closing that loop is hard.”

            <h2>Trump’s critical mineral reserve is an admission that the future is electric</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/trumps-critical-mineral-reserve-is-an-admission-that-the-future-is-electric/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration announced this week the U.S. government would work to build a $11.7 billion stockpile of critical minerals. That’s the headline; the subtext is more intriguing.

The stockpile initiative, branded as Project Vault, is the latest attempt by the administration to secure supplies of critical minerals for U.S. manufacturers and what President Donald Trump says will ensure “American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage.”

It follows recent investments from the administration into rare earth producers, including equity stakes in miners USA Rare Earth and MP Materials.

Individually, they can be interpreted as an administration taking steps to calm a part of the market that has been roiled by its own trade wars. Collectively, they’re an admission, however tacit or subconscious, that the future relies on electric technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines.

In his announcement, Trump alluded to the world’s dependence on China for a slew of critical minerals. Over the last year-plus, China has wielded its dominance to counter tariff threats from the Trump administration, restricting exports of rare earth metals and lithium battery materials to the United States. Eventually, China relented, but the episode made clear who held the trump card.

The spat also revealed just how integral critical minerals are to modern economies. Trump likened the new stockpile to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintained by the Department of Energy, which was set up in the wake of the oil embargo in the early 1970s.

“Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we’re now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don’t have any problems,” Trump said.

The oil reserve isn’t going away, but it’s not as important as it once was, diminished by productive U.S. oil wells and the increasing share of the energy market taken by solar, wind, and batteries. (Solar and wind continue to dominate new electric generating capacity, while more than 25% of new cars sold worldwide were EVs or plug-in hybrids.)

It’s not clear exactly which minerals will go into the reserve; Bloomberg reported that gallium and cobalt will be included. It’s possible that others like copper and nickel might get thrown in as well, though they weren’t mentioned.

The size of the investment is notable. The U.S. Export-Import Bank is providing a $10 billion loan, with private capital rounding out the rest. That’s about half the value of the oil currently in the Strategic Oil Reserve going toward a market that’s 1% the size of the global oil market, as Bloomberg columnist David Fickling pointed out.

The mismatch is either typical Trump bluster or an acknowledgement that the market for critical minerals is going to expand significantly in the coming years.

It is possible it’s both, with a greater chance it is the latter.

Much of the growth in critical minerals comes from clean energy technologies and EVs; without them, the market won’t be as constrained as experts have predicted. Demand for electronics, including data centers, will play a role, but more than half of global growth in rare earth element demand is expected to come from electric vehicles and wind turbines, according to the IEA. For cobalt and lithium, the figures are even more skewed, with EVs representing the vast majority of growth through 2050.

The Trump administration hasn’t been quiet about its distain for clean energy technologies, preferring to bet on the status quo with fossil fuels. But the rest of the world is continuing to move toward solar, wind, and batteries, driving up demand for critical minerals. The new stockpile shows that markets can be hard to ignore.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A data breach at government technology giant Conduent appears to affect far more people than first disclosed, with the number of victims potentially stretching to dozens of millions of people across the United States.

The January 2025 ransomware attack, which knocked out Conduent’s operations for several days, is now known to affect at least 15.4 million people in Texas alone, accounting for about half of the state’s population. Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected.

Another 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state’s attorney general.

Conduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch.

The stolen data includes individuals’ names, Social Security numbers, medical data and health insurance information.

One of the largest government contractors today, Conduent handles and processes large amounts of personal and sensitive information on behalf of large corporations, government departments, and several U.S. states. The company says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs.

When contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. The spokesperson would not say if the breach affects more than 100 million people.

Collins said that the company has been working to “conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information” taken in the breach, but would not say how many data breach notifications the company has sent out to date.

Little else is known about the breach, and the company has disclosed few details. Conduent disclosed the cyberattack in April, months after hackers knocked out the company’s systems, which resulted in outages to government services across the United States.

The Safeway ransomware gang took credit for the breach, claiming to have stolen over 8 terabytes of data.

In a later SEC filing, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals’ personal information associated with our clients’ end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers.

Conduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026. The company did not give a more specific timeline.

            <div id="article-text">An AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.

“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”

The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.

Called a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely on the transformer architecture that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.

Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.

As Fraenkel sees it, that’s a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.

“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”

That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.

In the first blush of their relationship, The Washington Post and Jeff Bezos seemed like an excellent match. Here was a paper with a strong pedigree that had fallen on somewhat hard times, and a suitor with funds who seemed eager to return it to steady glory. In 2013 Bezos purchased the paper for $250 million from the Graham family and promised a “golden era” to come. I had left the Post by then but was happy for my former colleagues. When Donald Trump took office a few years later, it was a relief to know that a journalistic institution with a record of holding White House misdeeds to account was still close by.

Yesterday, in a dismal morning Zoom call, the Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, announced that they were laying off one-third of its already diminished staff. The follow-up email had the tone of robotic obfuscation that any decent editor would have rewritten. (“Following up on today’s communication, I’m writing to share the difficult news that your position is eliminated as part of today’s organizational changes.”) It’s of course painful, as a journalist, to see fellow journalists get laid off. It’s painful, for anyone alert to the moment, to know that one of the last remaining expert watchdogs is hobbled. It’s maybe most painful to know it could have been avoided.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I spoke with Joshua Benton, the founder of and a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Benton has closely watched the media business for years. He explains how the newspaper reached this point, the loss to journalism, and how the future of the Post is ultimately up to Bezos.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Seven years ago, around this time, The Washington Post ran an ad in the Super Bowl: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It showed scenes of fires, explosions, floods, tanks—and journalists who’ve risked their lives for their profession.

All with swelling music and a voice-over by Tom Hanks.

Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.

Rosin: But then just before the Super Bowl this year, the Post took a different turn. And it was not another Super Bowl ad.

Matt Murray: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us.

Rosin: On Wednesday, Post staffers joined a Zoom call first thing in the morning. Executive editor Matt Murray spoke first.

Murray:  This meeting, for our newsroom, I wanna share that the actions we are taking include a broad strategic reset with a significant staff reduction.

Rosin: The paper would be making massive cuts: closing the Sports department …

Murray:  Unfortunately, we are grappling, and have been, with, just, major changes in the way sports news is delivered, shared, and experienced across the industry.

Rosin: Downsizing their Metro desk and International desk.

Murray: … shrinking our international footprint.

Rosin: One of their reporters based in Ukraine posted to X: “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”

Murray:  We will continue to have a strategic overseas presence in close to a dozen locations …

Rosin: The entire Books department at the Post was cut.

Murray:  We’ll be closing the Books section.

Rosin: A suspension of their daily news show.

Murray: And we’ll be suspending the Post Reports podcast.

Rosin: Every single department would be impacted.

Murray: As I said before, these moves are painful. This is a tough day.

Now I want to turn it over to Wayne Connell, and Wayne will be sharing more about the next steps in today’s timeline.

Wayne Connell: Thank you, Matt. In the spirit of providing clarity, after our call, I will send each of you an email. The subject line will either say, “Your role is eliminated by today’s workforce reductions” …

Rosin: In less than 30 minutes, a historic journalistic institution cut its staff by almost a third, after two previous rounds of punishing layoffs.

This was the home of the Watergate investigation.

Richard Nixon: Interests of the nation must always come before any personal consideration.

Henry Kissinger: … whole file cabinets can be stolen and then made available to the press …

Rosin: Winner of dozens and dozens of Pulitzer Prizes.

Announcer: And the prize goes to The Washington Post.

Rosin: Just to break that down: a paper in the backyard of the White House and Congress that has, many times, uncovered people in power lying or grifting, or failing to do their jobs in ways that affect every single American, whether or not they live in D.C.

Not to mention all the work their reporters have done in Ukraine, and China, and the Middle East and anywhere else in the world where crisis might be brewing

There are only a handful of mainstream national journalistic institutions left with this kind of robust infrastructure—experienced editors and reporters, photographers, foreign correspondents—who can expertly monitor people in power. Particularly at this moment in American history, when those people seem to be grifting and lying in new and elaborate ways.

Whose fault is this? Why does it matter? We talk to Joshua Benton. He’s a longtime newspaper reporter and the founder of a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, where he writes about the media business.

Rosin: So you cover the media business; you have for a long time. You are not new to this kind of industry news. What was your reaction to the layoffs at the Post?

Benton: Well, there have been a lot of systemic difficulties in the newspaper business as long as I’ve been reporting on it. There is a large secular decline that has been brought about by the internet that has continued on without too much change. But I think the story of the Post is a very unique-to-the-Post story. It’s fundamentally about one man, Jeff Bezos, and his changing vision of what the role of the owner of a major American newspaper should be.

Rosin: So you said two different things: It’s Post-specific and it’s also related to this giant in our culture, Jeff Bezos. I mean, I know why the news resonated with me—because I’m a journalist. I live in Washington. I worked at the Post. I have many friends there.

But I can imagine people who are not in any of those categories reading this news and thinking: Layoffs happen all the time, especially newspaper layoffs. This paper still exists, even though with less staff.

So why should they care? Why is it significant for people who don’t live in Washington, aren’t journalists?

Benton: Well, for one thing, The Washington Post has always been a paper whose editorial importance was not limited to the city or to the district. It’s a national outlet. It’s one of the two largest national newspaper outlets.

It covers the happenings in Washington, D.C. Certainly there’s lots of stories to cover there. So to the extent that we have any decrease in the number of people who are paying attention to what’s going on, I think that’s a loss.

It’s also a retrenchment from what Jeff Bezos first seemed to pledge when he first purchased the paper, in 2013, which was that he would not be looking to the newspaper as a source of money. He has enough money from lots of other sources. He did seem to take seriously the idea that he was a steward of an institution, the way that the Graham family that he purchased it from had always viewed the role of being in charge of this institution that mattered to the city and to the country.

And it’s certainly true that The Washington Post has lost money and is, has declined in a number of ways financially. It’s also up to Jeff Bezos whether or not he is going to support a newspaper that is going to be robust journalistically and ambitious digitally, or whether or not he has grown tired of it and decided to step back his investment in the property.

And I think what’s troubling in this particular change is, you’re seeing what had been an institution that had really benefited from his ownership for a good long time that seems to have gone into reverse in a way that particularly aligns with the way that the political winds in Washington have blown for the last few years.

Rosin: So it sounds like what you’re saying is the reason this is significant for everybody is because how Bezos changed his mind and changed his attitude towards the paper. So can you say a little more about that? What about his change of heart is important or strikes you as important?

Benton: We saw a confluence of events in the fall of 2024 around President Trump’s second election that I think were very telling. You had, in October, Bezos making a decision on behalf of the newspaper to stop endorsing candidates for president at a time that the newspaper would have certainly been expected to—and the editorial board of the newspaper had desired to—endorse Kamala Harris. Bezos put out a statement saying that actually it’s an awful idea for a newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate, because it creates the perception of bias. And we need to have a newspaper that doesn’t sully itself with a presidential endorsement.

Almost immediately that led to a huge negative impact to the paper’s bottom line because more than 250,000 existing subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and that’s the lifeblood of a modern-day media company. Not long after that, he announced that he was going to be shifting the way that the opinion pages of the paper functioned. He would potentially be eliminating most of the left-of-center perspectives in exchange for a focus on what he called “personal liberties and free markets.” He said explicitly, We will cover other issues besides personal liberties and free markets, but we will not be running any opinions that are in opposition to those.

He never really explained which personal liberties he was especially interested in, but it became pretty clear in the coming months that he was trying to shift the Post’s editorial page and opinion section more to the right, more aligned with the new Trump administration. And in the middle of that, you had the instance of Jeff Bezos appearing at Trump’s inauguration. You had the much-discussed, recently, purchase of the Melania Trump documentary at far-above market rates in a way that has been perceived by some to be something of a bribe.

You saw in this very short period of time a shift from the Post being an establishment—an institution—that was a potentially a powerful source of constraint on any presidential administration, but in particular this one, to the Post being perceived to be traveling along with the political winds.

Rosin: So it sounds like your analysis is very Bezos focused, because you could parse the blame for what happened on a few different places. It could be ownership—Jeff Bezos, management, just the state of the industry, the product itself. But you are focused on Bezos.

Benton: One thing that Jeff Bezos knows probably better than anyone else is that digital industries tend to focus around one big winner. I mean, Amazon.com is the perfect example of this. You went from a universe of having lots of diverse small retailers in the physical world, in malls and on main streets, to having one giant that dominates the online-retail business and doesn’t allow much else to thrive outside of it in a lot of cases. That same phenomenon happens in the digital news business. It’s just that, in digital news, The New York Times is Amazon.com. They are the giant that has been able to become overwhelmingly central to the way that the digital-newspaper business works. So in that context, the self-inflicted wounds that I would argue Bezos has caused the Post to suffer were particularly damaging because it was not competing from a position of strength. It was starting off from a position of relative market weakness.

Rosin: So initially we were talking about ideological factors, like a desire to curry favor with Trump, or at least not to irritate Trump. It sounds like now you’re talking about more, sort of, financial reasons. I mean, that suggests that, what, he’s a bad businessman?

Like, we don’t think of Jeff Bezos as a bad businessman. What does that suggest?

Benton: Jeff Bezos has not historically been very involved in the management of The Washington Post. He took a very hands-off approach to management. He was not, you know, meddling in editorial decisions. He was, in a lot of ways, for the first decade or so, a pretty ideal hands-off owner for the Post who put investment into the paper, who allowed its newsroom to grow, allowed, you know, a digital-subscription strategy to thrive.

But I don’t think at any point it has been a central part of where his business instincts have been focused. I wouldn’t view his ownership of The Washington Post as primarily a business transaction.

I think you could look at the first portion of his ownership as something approaching a philanthropic goal. And I think you can look at the last couple of years primarily as trying to meet a political goal.

One of the side effects of the changes that he made in 2024 or 2025 is that it drove away an enormous number of talented journalists, including to places like The Atlantic. One reason that the Post has struggled editorially over the past year is that they lost a lot of their best reporters, their highest-profile reporters who were the best source in the White House, in Congress, in places where, you know, the stories that a newspaper can break that gets you attention, that proves to your subscribers the value of the subscription they’re paying for.

The people who produce those stories often weren’t working there anymore. And the stories that they would have been writing, breaking, that would’ve been proving the value of a digital subscription to the Post—they just weren’t getting reported.

Rosin: So this is what—when people say a “death spiral” for news outlets where you have a shrinking business, leads to a downsized product, which leads to more shrinking business. Is that where the Post is now?

Benton: The biggest shift in the financial model of newspapers that has occurred in the transition from print to digital is a decreasing reliance on advertising and an increasing reliance on direct payments from subscribers. When newspapers had something closer to a monopoly on the distribution of information every day, they were able to charge very high advertising rates and they had mass audiences.

And it was a business that worked extremely well for them for a long time. Under the print model, an American newspaper usually made about 80 percent of its money from advertising and only about 20 percent from readers buying the paper or subscribing to the newspaper. In the shift to digital, the advertising money has largely gone away, to companies like Google and Facebook, and newspapers are increasingly reliant on subscriber revenue, especially, now, digital-subscriber revenue since that’s where the audiences are.

And to succeed in a digital-subscription world, you need to convince people why they should still pay for you every month when they’re also paying for Netflix and they’re also paying for Amazon Prime and they’re also paying for the long list of subscriptions that litter, you know, the credit-card bills of probably everyone listening to this.

That is a competitive marketplace where news organizations have a real editorial burden to prove their merits over and over again, and that means that a relatively small decision, like we’re not going to endorse someone for president can have a really outsized impact because it creates, for a quarter-million people, a reason to suddenly say, You know what? It’s not worth the 10 bucks a month, the 15 bucks a month that I’m paying if they’re gonna be doing something that I find so much in opposition to my point of view.

Rosin: After the break: Should people have really expected anything better from Bezos? And should all those people really have canceled their subscriptions? That’s in a minute.

Rosin: In retrospect, now that I hear you talk and see how important that moment was when hundreds of thousands of people canceled their subscription, it was an act of protest, but now I feel like, were they protesting against the right thing and for the right place? It’s like shooting yourself in your, you know, civic-participation foot. It just doesn’t seem like they were aiming at the right target there.

Benton: Yeah, you saw at the time, when people were canceling their subscriptions, you would see on social media reporters from the Post saying: please don’t cancel the Post. We understand that you may, may not like the decision that was made by our owner, but it’s your money that allows us to keep operating, to allow us to still have jobs.

So there is a real tension there. But at the same time, for me, it’s very difficult to describe what happened at the Post as primarily a market-driven phenomenon.

The amount of money that the Post is losing is enormous to you or to me. To Jeff Bezos, it is nothing. His net worth in the past year has gone up enough to continue to pay for all the money that The Washington Post is losing for the rest of his life and the rest of his children’s lives and the rest of his grandchildren’s lives.

His wealth is at such a scale that there is no reason that a set of cuts like the one that we’ve seen this week is an economic necessity. It’s a choice.

There are enormous negative financial things happening in the digital-news business more broadly, but I think that is distinct from what is happening to The Washington Post, because that is one man’s choice fundamentally.

Rosin: And do you think that’s a reasonable expectation you’re making of Jeff Bezos? Like, he’s a businessman, and so: Why should we expect him to behave differently than the many negligent owners of many newspapers who I’m sure you’ve tracked over the last decade-plus?

Benton: You know, that’s a very reasonable question. I’d say the reason I would expect different is because he acted differently. The Washington Post was never a source of profit for him in any significant way.

When Bezos first bought the Post, in 2013, one way I’d thought about it was: There aren’t many things that a man that wealthy and that powerful can do to change something in the first few paragraphs of his obituary. When Jeff Bezos dies he will be described as the founder of Amazon.com, who, you know, created one of the great fortunes of all time.

You know, if he takes mankind to another planet, perhaps that would show up there as well. (Laughs.)

If he had saved one of the most important journalistic institutions in America, that would be another thing that would show up in those first few paragraphs, perhaps. There are reasons for someone with that much wealth to invest in something that they think is good for society, good for civilization, good for the country.

And the way he spoke when he purchased the Post was filled with language of, I’m giving you runway. I’m not a shareholder you have to pay in the same way that a publicly held or hedge-fund-purchased newspaper company would have to.

And it was the fact that that was his stance for so long, for a decade, that makes this transition, I think, somewhat jarring to people within the Post and people who read the Post.

Rosin: So it seems like the Post was struggling when Bezos bought it, and the layoffs seem to indicate it’s struggling now. But it did seem to be doing well at one point in his tenure. What made that possible, and what changed?

Benton: So our insight into the financial condition of the Bezos-era Post is really limited, because, as a privately held company, they don’t have to report any numbers to shareholders or regulators. It certainly was true, though, that they benefited starting around 2017 with the “Trump bump” that helped a lot of news organizations.

Once Trump was elected in this very unusual new federal government came into place, there was a huge increase in interest in national news that sort of raised all boats, and the Post certainly benefited from that because they were, along with the Times, one of the premier operations that was covering what was happening in Washington during this very unusual time.

So they had a huge increase in the number of subscribers that they had. They reached a peak, they reported, of around 3 million digital subscribers, which was the third-highest in the country behind the Times and also The Wall Street Journal. They were breaking stories left and right. When Bezos first appeared, he was willing to invest into increasing a lot of positions within the newsroom, adding a lot of people on the product side and on the digital side of the operation. It was a good time to be at the Post.

They also happened to have a very good editor at the time, Marty Baron, and they were blessed with the first Trump administration as a story to cover. There certainly is a universe in which you could have imagined a second Trump administration providing that same sort of bump or at least a smaller version of it to the Post.

But this is, one of the other unfortunate things about the timing is that at the exact moment that this second Trump administration was beginning was right when Jeff Bezos had shot themselves in the foot by not endorsing the presidential election and causing these 250,000 subscribers to cancel and making this pivot into having the Opinion section only be about “free markets” and the promotion of what he considers to be “personal liberties.”

I think there really was an opportunity for the Post to have another good stretch, editorially and financially. And I think you can point to some decisions that Bezos made as reasons why that didn’t happen.

Rosin: I mean, one question is, do you get the sense that the tech crowd thinks that journalism done by humans just doesn’t matter that much? Like, it’s the opposite of our future.

Benton: I’ve seen dozens and dozens of tech companies and start-ups and AI companies who tend to view news as a world of inefficiencies that are waiting to be quote-unquote “fixed.”

They look at a newsroom, which hires expensive people to do a lot of manual gathering of information and manual writing-up of that information or production of podcasts or videos about that information. They see a process that they think can be rendered more efficient and can have a lot of the cost structure ripped out of it.

I’m open to technological changes that could push in that direction. If they find wonderful ways to create that universe, you know, I’d love to hear about it. At the same time, I think, at a time that we as a society are increasingly concerned about the role of a few large technology companies and AI algorithms that we don’t have a lot of insight into, the amount of control that those institutions seem to have on very fundamental elements of the way information gets distributed, the way that the economy works—I think there’s a real disconnect in values there that I think would be pretty difficult for anyone to navigate.

Rosin: Let me just try this on you. Like, is there some alternate way that you can imagine holding government accountable? I guess I’m asking: Is journalism irrelevant? Like, is there any other way to create an informed citizenry?

Are we clinging to something that just, you know, isn’t gonna last?

Rosin: I know it’s a terrible question. I’m just trying to elicit the best argument for why anyone should care about what you even are describing as this thing that has totally different values than this other thing. And I understand this other thing to have most of the money and you know, to have, for a long time, kind of shaped our culture.

Benton: But at the same time, if you look at a place like Minneapolis and you look at the power that video images of things happening in the streets, to someone like Renee Good: The impact that the right information can have on a political body; on a citizenry; on a populace; on a protest movement; eventually, on a government—that power, in my mind, hasn’t been diminished.

It used to be that it was much more the realm of individual reporters and individual newspapers and television networks to dig up this information and to share this information. Now there are many more potential inputs into that system, right?

But that doesn’t, to my mind, reduce the power that information—accurate, timely information about the world around us—can have in how society and government work. I think that we had a sort of unusual glory period for a number of decades across the 20th century where the things that were healthy for our democracy were also things that aligned really well with an advertising-driven business model.

It didn’t make a lot of sense at an intellectual level that the same people who would be reporting on what’s happening in Baghdad or what’s happening on some distant battlefield would be putting their work right next to furniture-store ads and classified ads for jobs and all the other things that created this unusual mixture of elements that was 20th-century mass media.

We were kind of lucky that those happened to align for a while. And they very much do not align anymore. I think the shift away from relying on advertising and relying on subscribers and people willing to invest, essentially, in what they see as being useful for democracy is a potential route to stability, in that—you know, The New York Times has been able to navigate that extremely well. They’re a much bigger business than they’ve ever been before and still doing lots of excellent journalism, though I’m sure everyone can critique any number of pieces of it.

I still think that there is an enormous amount of value in the work that journalists do, and there are models out there. And one of those models that a lot of people, for a while, had some hope in was philanthropically minded billionaires who would see the value in what journalism was doing, and also have the capacity to remove it from the marketplace of capitalism, at least to a degree.

And I think Jeff Bezos did that for a while, to a certain degree. So I think that’s why it’s extra-frustrating to see him instead shoving The Washington Post right back into that marketplace and saying, Oh no, now I have to make the same sort of decisions that someone who, you know, a struggling businessman who is worried about paying his mortgage might have to make—to make the difficult cuts.

That’s what makes it difficult—that this is very much a choice. This is a choice that one man made that is going to harm a lot of journalists and is going to harm a lot of people who would have benefited from the journalism.

Rosin: Okay, so: Is there a path forward for The Washington Post?

Benton: That’s entirely up to Jeff Bezos. He could decide to convert The Washington Post into a nonprofit. He could decide to keep shrinking and keep cutting. He could decide to invest again in anything that he’s decided not to invest in. It’s a property that he has total and complete control over. I think there is a path forward for good journalism.

The Post benefits from its incredible history and the relationships it has built up over the decades in Washington and beyond. But it’s also hamstrung by that history and by the fact that it is built out as a print business that has shifted towards digital as opposed to being a digital-first business, right. There are paths forward, and it’s really up to one man to decide if he chooses to take any of them.

            <h2>The Only Thing That Will Turn Measles Back</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/measles-vaccination-rebound-when/685889/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since measles vaccination became common among Americans, the logic of outbreaks has been simple: When vaccination rates fall, infections rapidly rise; when vaccination rates increase, cases abate. The United States is currently living out the first half of that maxim.

Measles-vaccination rates have been steadily declining for several years; since last January, the country has logged its two largest measles epidemics in more than three decades. The second of those, still ballooning in South Carolina, is over 875 cases and counting. In April, measles may be declared endemic in the U.S. again, 26 years after elimination.

When and if the maxim’s second part—a rebound in vaccination—might manifest “is the key question,” Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Experts anticipate a shift eventually. Vaccine coverage has often been beholden to a kind of homeostatic pull, in which it dips and then ricochets in response to death and suffering. In 2022, for instance, in the weeks after polio paralyzed an unvaccinated man in Rockland County, New York, the families of more than 1,000 under-vaccinated children heeded advice to immunize.

During past outbreaks, though, health authorities at local, state, and federal levels have given that same advice—vaccinate, now—loudly, clearly, and persistently. In 2026, the U.S. is facing the possibility of more and bigger measles outbreaks, as federal leaders have actively shrunk vaccine access, dismissed vaccine experts, and sowed doubts about vaccine benefits. Under these conditions, many experts are doubtful that facing down more disease, even its worst consequences, will convince enough Americans that more protection is necessary.

After the first major rash of measles cases appeared in and around West Texas about this time last year, many local families did rush to get vaccines, including early doses for infants; some families living near South Carolina’s outbreak, now bigger than West Texas’s was, have opted into free vaccination clinics too. Even in states far from these epidemics, such as Wisconsin, health-care providers have seen an uptick in vaccination, Jonathan Temte, a family-medicine physician and vaccine-policy expert at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. But, he said, those boosts in interest have been concentrated primarily among people already enthusiastic about vaccination, who were seeking additional protection as the national situation worsened. At the same time, many of South Carolina’s free vaccination clinics have been poorly attended; some community members hit by the worst of the outbreak in West Texas have stood by their decision to not vaccinate.

Protection against measles has always been fragile: Sky-high levels of vaccination—at rates of at least 92 to 95 percent—are necessary to stave off outbreaks. And after holding steady for years, uptake of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been dropping unevenly in communities scattered across the U.S. since around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, pulling down the nationwide average. Recent research from a team led by Eric Geng Zhou, a health economist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has found that, although many communities in the Northeast and Midwest have generally high MMR-vaccine uptake, others in regions such as West Texas, southern New Mexico, and the rural Southeast, as well as parts of Mississippi, don’t have much protection to speak of.

COVID can bear some of the blame for these patches of slipping vaccination. It disrupted families’ routine of visits to the pediatrician, leading to delayed or missed vaccinations. Those interruptions quickly resolved for some families, Zhou told me, but they remained for many others, lagging, for instance, among people of lower socioeconomic status who are less likely to have consistent access to health care and reliable health information. At the same time, the pandemic deepened political divides over public-health policies, including vaccination. In the years since, Republicans have become substantially more hesitant than Democrats about immunizing their children. “The COVID pandemic created this persistent divergence,” Zhou told me.

Pockets with under-vaccinated people have always existed, tracking alongside groups that are less likely to engage with all kinds of medical care, including people with less education or lower income, or those who belong to certain ethnic minorities. Anti-vaccine activists—including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services—have also spent years spreading misinformation about the vaccine. But maybe most crucial, vaccination status clusters in communities—depending intimately on whether, for instance, children are raised by parents who are themselves vaccinated. The net effect of COVID, misinformation, and changing political tides is that the chasms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated have widened, an especially dangerous proposition for measles, a virus that is estimated to infect 90 percent of the unimmunized people it encounters.

Last year, as measles ignited in West Texas, some experts wondered whether attitudes about the MMR vaccine might shift once the virus killed someone. Since the start of 2025, three unvaccinated people have died from measles, two of them young children. But because that outbreak centered on several rural Mennonite communities that have long been distrustful of vaccines, many Americans seem to have treated those three deaths as a mostly isolated problem, Noel Brewer, a vaccine-behavior expert at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, told me. (Brewer was a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices before Kennedy overhauled the group entirely last year.)

More broadly, the disease still has a misleading reputation as harmless enough that “it’s not a big deal if you get it,” Rupali Limaye, a vaccine-behavior expert at Johns Hopkins University, told me. But even if measles’ severe outcomes were more common, Limaye and others were doubtful that many more Americans would be moved to act. COVID vaccines still offer protection against the disease’s worst outcomes, yet so far this winter, just 17 percent of adults and 8 percent of children have gotten a COVID shot. And although the seasonal flu typically hospitalizes hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. each year, tens of thousands of whom die, flu-vaccine uptake regularly hovers below 50 percent. For measles, “how many deaths is enough to be a tipping point?” Offit asked. “I don’t know that.”  If anything, the nation’s top health officials have encouraged people to embrace the tolls of infectious illness. The Trump administration responded to the deaths last year with relatively tepid messages about the benefits of measles vaccines—which are excellent at preventing severe illness, infection, and transmission—all while promoting nutritional supplementation with vitamin A. More recently, CDC’s new principal deputy director, Ralph Abraham, described the prospect of measles becoming endemic in the U.S. as “just the cost of doing business.” Last month, CDC ended long-standing recommendations urging all Americans to receive an annual flu shot; later that week, Kennedy told CBS News that it may be a “better thing” if fewer kids get vaccinated against the flu. And Kirk Milhoan, the new chair of CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, recently questioned the need for the MMR vaccine, arguing that measles’ risks may now be lower than they once were, in part because hospitals are better equipped to treat the disease than they used to be.

When reached for comment over email, Andrew G. Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at HHS, disputed the notion that the department has hindered the country’s response to measles, writing, “Under Secretary Kennedy, CDC surged resources and multiple states declared measles outbreaks over in 2025.” He added that “Secretary Kennedy and other leaders at HHS have consistently said that vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of measles.”

The counsel of health-care providers, not federal health officials, remains a top predictor of whether people will immunize. But when vaccine uptake has wavered in the past, governments have been key to buoying those levels again. In the 1970s, for example, after safety concerns about a whooping-cough vaccine—later proved false—plummeted rates of uptake in the United Kingdom and spurred a series of major outbreaks, an eventual government-sponsored campaign helped limit the dip in vaccination to a few years. In the 2010s, rising rates of families seeking nonmedical exemptions for vaccination in California helped precipitate the state’s Disneyland measles outbreak, which spread to six other states, as well as Canada and Mexico; MMR-vaccination rates throughout California jumped above 95 percent only after new state legislation strengthened school mandates. And in the early 1990s, local health officials ended a Philadelphia measles epidemic—which by then had sickened at least 1,400 people and killed nine children—after they took the extreme step of getting a court order to compel community members to vaccinate children.

When governments withdraw support for vaccines, immunization rates can crater. In 2013, an unfounded safety concern about the HPV vaccine prompted Japanese health authorities to suspend strong national recommendations for the immunization; the move caused uptake among adolescent and young teenage girls to drop, from about 70 to 80 percent to less than 1 percent within a year, according to Brewer, who is co-authoring a research paper on the subject. Japan did not reinstate its HPV recommendation until nearly a decade later—and coverage has since recovered to only about half of its original baseline.

Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, wrote that the U.S. is now following the approach of peer nations that “achieve high vaccination rates without mandates by relying on trust, education, and strong doctor-patient relationships.” But Kennedy has also publicly discouraged people from “trusting the experts.” Limaye, who consults with local health-care providers, said that the biggest question that her contacts are now hearing from patient families is “Who am I supposed to believe?” Meanwhile, CDC’s website now contradicts the widespread and decades-long scientific consensus that vaccines don’t cause autism.

If MMR-vaccine uptake does rebound, experts suspect it will rise unevenly across the country, likely skirting the politically red regions where vaccination rates most urgently need to increase. In this way, the self-reinforcing nature of vaccination status is dangerous: Even while highly protected groups might double down on immunization, under-vaccinated groups can remain unprotected. Leaving enough places lingering below the crucial measles-vaccination threshold “will ensure repeated and large outbreaks,” Brewer said. West Texas and South Carolina were just the start; this year, measles will sicken more people, which means more deaths will follow, and likely soon. The Trump administration is testing how much resilience American vaccination rates have in the absence of federal support, and the answer emerging for measles so far is: not enough.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Calling the Trump administration fascist has become a cliché, but some federal departments seem keen on the comparison. Consider the administration’s messaging on social media.

The Department of Homeland Security’s Facebook account recently posted a recruiting notice for ICE under the banner “WE’LL HAVE OUR HOME AGAIN”—the title of a white-nationalist anthem by the Pine Tree Riots (“By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet”). The Department of Labor recently posted a video montage referencing American battle scenes under the tagline “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American”—a slogan close to the Nazi-era Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.

Many of these posts borrow overtly from Christianity. In December, the DHS and White House accounts shared Christmas-themed posts celebrating mass deportations and encouraging self-deportation. One featured videos of armed agents performing night raids, with a caption quoting Matthew 5:9 in black-letter type: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

Macho displays and transgressive memes mark a significant shift in how the federal government sees and promotes its mission—and sanctions state violence. It may be tempting to see this change as an organic or bottom-up phenomenon, as if federal agencies are appealing to Proud Boys to lure more ICE recruits. But the reality is that this transformation is the culmination of years of work by niche groups of conservative intellectuals who have long rejected America’s liberal traditions—and now dominate the halls of power.

There were signs from the start that a Trump-led GOP would reward transgression against liberal-democratic norms. In “The Flight 93 Election,” a September 2016 essay for the Claremont Institute, the former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Anton called on fellow conservatives to “charge the cockpit” and vote for Trump in order to prevent a more dire outcome: the election of Hillary Clinton as president. Anton, who went on to serve on the National Security Council in Trump’s first term and the State Department in his second, used his polemic to decry Davos-style globalist pieties as “managerial Davoisie liberalism” and hail Trump’s plans to stop “importing poverty, crime, and alien cultures.” Trump, he allowed, “is worse than imperfect,” but this didn’t matter. Trump, Anton argued, offered a lifeline for an irrelevant conservative movement and a dying republic.

This call to arms scandalized many establishment conservatives, some of whom provided a check on Trump in his first term. Members of Trump’s first cabinet prevented him from ratcheting up his trade war, fully alienating allies, deploying U.S. troops to American cities, and withdrawing them suddenly from overseas.

After the “Unite the Right” rally turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the alt-right appeared to lose steam. The White House chief strategist Steve Bannon fell from grace, the white nationalist Richard Spencer mostly vanished from the public eye, and controversial figures including Sebastian Gorka and Darren Beattie were ultimately ousted from the administration. Even Stephen Miller looked vulnerable for a time. Many conservatives assumed that the events of January 6, 2021, would rightfully prevent Trump from holding public office ever again.

Instead, January 6 came to signify the staying power of Trumpism, and offered a new rallying cry and loyalty test for a more radicalized GOP.

In October 2021, the Heritage Foundation tapped Kevin Roberts, the former CEO of the Trump-friendly Texas Public Policy Foundation, to be its next president—marking a change in orientation for one of Washington’s most influential conservative think tanks. At the National Conservatism Conference in 2022, Roberts declared his “fellowship with the principles” MAGA’s main intellectual movement had advanced “to rescue America from the barbarians inside the gates of our very own institutions.” At the same gathering, the natcon leader Yoram Hazony argued that Christian domination is the only safeguard against “the religion of woke neo-Marxism.”

Today, elite MAGA-world figures including Anton and Peter Thiel flirt openly with the idea of Caesarism, or a “Red Caesar,” whereby a lone authoritarian ruler might restore the country’s strength. “Postliberals” such as Patrick Deneen write about how “regime change” is possible only with a new elite—one that understands the value of “Machiavellian means to achieve Aristotelian ends.” The influential philosopher-blogger Curtis Yarvin has called for a total dismantling of “the cathedral,” by which he means the all-powerful liberal institutions at the center of modern life (universities, media outlets), which operate like a Church in that they dictate how people should think.

George Packer: An anatomy of the MAGA mind

What unifies these thinkers is a totalizing and conspiratorial conception of modern liberal politics. In this view, very little in the existing order is worth redeeming. Some even argue that the most patriotic way forward is simply to burn it all down.

All of this intellectual boundary-breaking can be intoxicating, especially against the backdrop of a wider culture that has at times tipped into stultifying speech codes and groupthink. But the rebellion has also spurred a race to the bottom. This is how a group chat among young Republicans devolves into talk of loving Hitler.

Richard Hanania, a political scientist who knows a good deal about such dynamics owing to the years he spent writing pseudonymously for alt-right and white-supremacist publications, calls this phenomenon the “based ritual.” Young ideologues compete to prove their fealty to MAGA by engaging in a kind of transgressive one-upmanship. In this performance, the risk of appearing racist or sexist is well outweighed by the risk of seeming disloyal to Trump.

Prominent conservatives have publicly discussed the value of shifting the Overton window. In 2023, Christopher Rufo hosted a debate about whether to broaden the tent to include racists and other extremists—a “no enemies to the right” strategy.

This is very much a live question. In October, after Tucker Carlson hosted the young white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes in a long and indulgent interview on his podcast, quite a few conservatives struggled to distance themselves from Fuentes without alienating other political allies. Roberts, at the Heritage Foundation, raised hackles when he initially defended Carlson. He then tried to split the difference by criticizing Fuentes but not Carlson, but still faced an exodus of staff and several resignations from the board of trustees for legitimizing extremism. Clearly some conservatives are still willing to hold the more radical factions of the party to account.

Jonathan Chait: The conservative movement’s intellectual collapse

Unfortunately, these traditional, more principled conservatives are not ascendant. In the early days of the Heritage fiasco, Harvard’s Adrian Vermeule, perhaps the most sophisticated thinker of the MAGA new right, warned against factional infighting when the enemy is “at the very gates.” What is notable here is that for Vermeule, the “enemies” are liberals. Such language handily buttresses Trump’s constant talk of the “enemy from within.” It’s a philosophy that allows the administration to portray liberal activists as domestic terrorists, and mass peaceful protests as “engineered chaos.”

That kind of edgelordism has become the currency du jour in the GOP, from the Ivy League through the streets of Minnesota. The MAGA new right seems to be betting that the American polity has a deep reserve of untapped nativist rage—which can be harnessed in the service of their culture war against the liberal status quo, or of ICE’s more tangible goals. But if current polls are to be believed, the administration seems to be underestimating the everyday decency and patriotism of the American public.

Boundary-pushing ideas can be invigorating, and opportunities to question and resist received wisdom are essential to any free and democratic society. But the pursuit of transgression for its own sake can easily derail sound judgment. The risk is in presuming that anything subversive or sensational is also true and meaningful, and that anything conventional is a lie that must be smashed down. That is a brutal way to inhabit the world—and, I hope, a losing one.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a frigid white January afternoon in 1982, an airplane took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for Florida, remained aloft for about 30 seconds, and then stalled out and collided with the 14th Street Bridge, plunging into the ice-floe-studded waters of the Potomac River. In The Washington Post’s newsroom, an aghast 24-year-old college-basketball reporter named Michael Wilbon watched live reports of the disaster on the mounted TV banks, heard the urgency among those around him, grabbed a notebook and his jacket, and ran toward the riverbank to report on the rescue efforts, because that was what he’d been schooled to do. He never got a byline—his name never appeared on the story.

Reminiscing in a phone call with me last night, Wilbon recalled that the old offices of the Post’s editors, at the newspaper’s former building on 15th Street, had glass walls inside—so on the night of the crash, he could see Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, and his deputies huddling. “They were meeting,” Wilbon remembered. “They kept meeting. So finally, I said, Well, let’s just fucking go.” Trailing Wilbon was another 20-something college-sports reporter named John Feinstein. They interviewed witnesses and rescuers, then hustled over to an old Marriott hotel at the Arlington mouth of the bridge, where they huddled by a phone reading their notes to someone in the office taking dictation. Feinstein, who died last year, didn’t get a byline either; cub reporters often didn’t. It was just what he’d been schooled to do. (He did become a best-selling author, though. Wilbon later got famous co-anchoring ESPN’s Pardon the Interruption.)

For some years now, the Washington Post newsroom has defied gravity, thanks to the internal ethic just described. Usually, when people in an office distrust feckless leaders, when they are subjected to corporate verbiage that bounces off the face and leaves a rage headache behind—phrases such as reevaluating our model and reposition, used to obscure the catastrophic fact that approximately 300 jobs, or a third of the newsroom, have been “eliminated” (the contemptible formulation by which Post staffers were laid off today)—they will subtly gear down their efforts. But my former colleagues do the opposite. For every half-wit decision by a poseur in a 42-long, slim-fit suit, they report even harder. This ethic has been especially true in the renowned Sports section, which was killed in a Zoom announcement notable for its belly-wriggling cowardice and self-owning incompetence. The Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, and its executive editor, Matt Murray, apparently did not have enough brace in their back to face the newsroom in person.

The Post Sports section is, was, no ordinary section, in heritage or in coverage. It was habitually young, because it required hiring people with no sense of off-the-clockness: Events happen at nights and on weekends, on tough deadlines that require sprinting stadium stairs and downing a pack of smoked almonds for a late dinner. Donald Graham, the Post’s longtime publisher, spent time as Sports editor when he was learning the family trade. His Sports successor, George Solomon, liked to spot good young talent cheap and let us run—and ran us ragged. “Hey,” he said to me once during a hectic NFL season, “I need you to stop in Green Bay on your way home from Dallas.”

We moved in a close group. Every two years, eight or 10 of us would fly off to the Olympics in some international city. For two and a half weeks, we’d have a choice between eating and sleeping; the deadlines didn’t allow for both. We reported shoulder to shoulder in narrow press pens in stadium bowels so dank and sweaty that, as my ex-colleague Barry Svrluga has said, “it’s like working inside someone’s mouth.”

At the Beijing Summer Olympics, in 2008, we were so exhausted from the round-the-clock work that we threw blankets and sheets over a table to make a tent and stuck a pillow on the floor beneath it. You could crawl in there and catch a nap. We named it “the Happy Place,” and when someone was sleeping, we’d put stick-’em notes on their clothes—I once drew a picture of a gas gauge with the needle on empty and stuck it on a colleague—and take pictures of them. When deadline was finally over, at 3 a.m., we’d entertain ourselves with a liquored-up singing game that our colleague Liz Clarke named “Stupid-Guy Anthems.” In Sochi, we learned a Russian hockey anthem from a couple of young guys running an all-night café. At the end of every Olympics, our editor Tracee Hamilton would crack open a Guinness and recite the St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V, about “we happy few.” We laughed so hard that the New York Times staffers sitting in their office beyond a plywood wall would shush us—for which we would toss pencils at them.

We came from all over, competed desperately to outwrite one another, teased one another mercilessly, loved one another. One day, Feinstein said to John Ed Bradley, our mellow-voiced football writer from Louisiana, “Hey, John Ed, did you marry your huntin’ dog Red yet?” I loved to kid my desk-mate Christine Brennan, who was from Toledo, “Hey, Chris, what’d you do for fun yesterday? Leave the butter out overnight?”

We had the best writers in the country and did more with less, and we knew it with a swagger. In addition to Wilbon and Feinstein, Solomon found a young writer named David Remnick, who once wrote of the basketball player George Gervin that he was “sinuous as smoke.” That was before Remnick got an urge to become a foreign correspondent and went off to win a Pulitzer covering the demise of the Soviet Union—it was what he’d been schooled to do. (Eventually, he became the editor of The New Yorker.)

Remnick was trained by Solomon, as we all were, to grab the pen and go, and to regard sportswriting as merely another portal through which to report on the broadest subjects: labor issues, performance enhancement, domestic violence, racism, sexism, terrorism, global corruptions such as vote-buying in the Olympics. Journalism as Solomon, Graham, Bradlee, and others had taught us didn’t change with the subject. And it was an ethic as much as a job, about responsibility to other people. “If you’re late, we’re all late,” Solomon told me. “If you’re wrong, we’re all wrong.” Not a bad way to mature an unfinished young person.

The Washington Post’s sportswriters could cover anything—and did—because we were taught to look with a hard eye, write vividly and observationally, and hit our deadlines no matter what, which made other section bosses always want us. Remnick was just one of the earliest examples of the Sports section turning out great foreign and national correspondents. Isabelle Khurshudyan, a hockey writer, won honors covering the war in Ukraine and became the Post’s Kyiv bureau chief. Chico Harlan, a baseball writer, became a foreign bureau chief in East Asia and then Rome. Eli Saslow, a sports feature writer, went on to win a Pulitzer writing about American poverty. David Nakamura, a college-sports writer, broke stories about poisoned drinking water in Washington, D.C.; corresponded from Afghanistan and Pakistan; and now covers the Justice Department.

In 2011, Rick Maese, a sports feature writer, went to Japan on vacation with his wife, the Metro staffer Erin Cox. While they were there, an earthquake hit, followed by a tsunami, followed by a nuclear meltdown. They spent their trip covering the Fukushima disaster. The baseball writer Chelsea Janes, like me, also covered presidential campaigns; the plundering of our staff by National editors was a continual irritant to our Sports bosses, though they were proud of us.

The now-retired Liz Clarke wrote a memorable magazine story about Bruce Springsteen and spent years doggedly investigating the Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder for allowing a culture of sexual harassment and assault to fester within the team office; after Clarke and her fellow reporter Will Hobson finally chased down the story and got it into print, the fallout eventually forced Snyder to sell.

Clarke, a North Carolinian, worked with a gentle singing voice with which she asked the toughest questions of NFL billionaires. I liked to imitate her talking with an NFL owner this way: “Of course, a role as lofty as yours does come with certain prerogatives of judgment,” she’d say with a soft smile. “But I wonder if it might not be the smallest misstep and breed the teeniest bit of mistrust in the team to go with a quarterback who thinks hydration is tequila and ranch water?”

In addition to writing political profiles, I was recruited to cover the September 11 attacks in New York—I stuck my driver’s license and a $20 bill in my sock and ran all the way downtown—as well as two hurricanes. Right after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, I stood in front of a huge map in the newsroom with the editors Liz Spayd and Phil Bennett, who were trying to decide exactly where to send me. After a pause, Bennett said, “Texas is big.” We settled on Mississippi. I met up with the photographer Jonathan Newton, a hurricane veteran who had pallets of water and gas cans strapped down in an SUV, as well as a boxful of cigarillos. He handed me one. We smoked them to kill the smells.

Only the people who live their work in a newsroom will understand this: One of the best things I ever tasted was shots of Maker’s Mark, neat, shared in a Mississippi motel parking lot at 1 a.m. with Newton and other photographers, out of a makeshift bar in the back of an SUV. We’d spent the day covering the damage that Katrina, with its 26-foot wall of water and 160-mile-per-hour winds, had wrought—had seen boats on freeway medians and a piano in a treetop at Jefferson Davis’s old home—and our dinner was whiskey and fried pickles, and it was good. We shared a room at a Hampton Inn where the door wouldn’t lock because the floods had ruined the electronics, and we brushed our teeth together.

You’d think a newspaper that has so botched its finances, and that is trying to do more with less, could use people with such ethic and versatility. “We should have been the last ones in the room,” Wilbon told me last night.

One of the most valuable things lost with the killing of the Sports section will be the Post’s sense of proper training of the young. After I covered my first Army-Navy game, the great columnist Thomas Boswell took me to dinner and talked writing. My first Olympics was the Calgary Games in 1988, and I wrote well out of sheer excitement. When I got home, the columnist Tony Kornheiser, now Wilbon’s longtime Pardon the Interruption co-host, told me, “You did great. But listen. This is your level now, all the time. You don’t retreat from this level.” I did 10 Olympics for the Post. At the Athens Games, in 2004, I took pleasure in watching the young Svrluga lift his own writing game out of sheer excitement. “This is your level now,” I told him. “You don’t retreat from it.”

That’s who we were, and who we are. I say “we” because I left The Washington Post for The Atlantic five months ago, after 30 years at the paper, and I still have the reflexes and the friends. I also feel an anger at the demise of the Sports section—about 40 of 45 people fired, the rest thrown to other sections—that cannot be extinguished, and that only grows as more details emerge. This superb section was treated the following way:

The Post’s Olympics writers were notified just 10 days ago, right before some of them were scheduled to depart for the Milan Games, that their coverage was canceled—with little explanation. Just 36 hours later, management reversed itself and quietly suggested: Well, okay, four writers could go, but with the understanding that they could be laid off during the assignment. This is the sort of managerial aimlessness the Post is being governed by, just one example of the missteps and squandering of opportunity framed as strategy.

The Olympics writers were given a choice: If laid off, they could either fly home or finish the assignment. “I know what they’ll do,” the Sports editor Jason Murray told me on the phone last night. “I know who they are.” They will finish the assignment. Svrluga, the most knowledgeable Olympics writer in the country, who has been “eliminated,” filed a comprehensive story on Mikaela Shiffrin while knowing that the knife was at his neck. This morning, I texted him: “Will you keep filing from there?” I got a one-word answer.

Another of those laid off was the deputy Sports editor, Matt Rennie, a quarter-century veteran of the paper who happens to be the single finest thinker and pencil-wielder I have ever worked with at any level. Rennie cleared out his desk Monday and last night without a single piece of straight information from leadership about his fate; he simply assumed that he was laid off because no one said anything to him, and no one stopped him, either. At home, he wrote a note to colleagues that hit the nail on the head: “The people making these decisions have failed in their responsibility to our readers, whom they never took the time to know, and have undermined—likely irreparably—the ideals of an institution they never bothered to try to understand.” These moves, he added, “ultimately, will power the Post’s competitors.” The best Sports section that ever was has been destroyed by people who failed to even notice what a jewel they had.

Anne Applebaum: Readers don’t trust dirty tricks

The irony in this situation is that Will Lewis and Matt Murray have rendered themselves unemployable anywhere else (who would have them after this?), whereas Post Sports staffers will no doubt be much in demand. As Rennie wrote to his colleagues, “Whenever and wherever we land—and we will—we’ll be comin’. And hell is comin’ with us.”

I disagree with Rennie about just one thing: I’m not sure the damage to the Post is irreparable. Jeff Bezos, its billionaire owner, only thinks he owns the Post, and Lewis and Murray only think they run it. At the heart of the institution is something that no one can ever own: the Wilbonian core trained into all of us, an impulse to run to the riverbank that these bumbling strangers who have hobbled the publication will never grasp.</div>

The U.S. dollar is getting weaker, and that’s just how the president wants it. During an appearance last Tuesday at the Machine Shed Restaurant in Urbandale, Iowa, Donald Trump told reporters that the dollar’s declining exchange rate was “great.”

Trump understands that a weak dollar doesn’t sound good. In his first term, he tweeted, “As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not!” His logic is that the relatively weak currencies of America’s foreign competitors, such as China and Japan, can make their goods cheaper in international markets, and that the United States would do well to replicate their strategy. This theory isn’t unfounded—a weak dollar would boost the economy in certain respects—but the president’s unpredictable foreign-policy and global-trade decisions are threatening to erode America’s economic standing abroad in a far more significant way.

When Trump talks about the relative strength or weakness of the dollar, he’s talking about its value in foreign-exchange markets. When the dollar index plunged 1.3 percent last Tuesday, that meant the dollar lost 1.3 percent of its value relative to a group of competing currencies, making some foreign goods a little more expensive to import. It did not mean that your dollar was immediately worth 1.3 percent less at the grocery store (although costlier imports do somewhat counteract the president’s affordability agenda).

That’s partly why, despite some mixed messaging after he took office in 2017, Trump has been fixated on a weak dollar for much of his adult life: In 1987, he took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Boston Globe lamenting the dollar’s strength against the weakness of Japan’s “brilliantly” managed yen. A weaker dollar makes American companies and American goods more competitive abroad. Theoretically, the incentive to export and the disincentive to import could push companies to invest in domestic manufacturing—bringing back factory jobs and providing one potential path to the president’s long-held goal of squashing the trade deficit.

It’s typically pretty hard for American presidents to unilaterally effect a long-term change in the dollar’s exchange rate. Kenneth Rogoff, formerly the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, told me that because the exchange rate is governed by so many different factors, the president wishing for a weaker dollar is “like doing a rain dance.” One of those factors is interest-rate policy—which is why the Federal Reserve usually has far more influence over the dollar’s value than the president does. When borrowing costs go down, the dollar index also tends to go down. Part of the reason Trump is so keen on exerting greater control over the Fed is its power over the value of money.

Although Trump hopes a weaker dollar will boost American exports, he’s also taking steps that could more than offset any gains. His mercurial policies are now threatening to push away some of America’s long-standing trading partners. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. dollar has been by far the world’s most dominant currency: Banks around the world tend to lend and borrow in dollars; many transactions that don’t touch America are conducted in dollars; and nearly 90 percent of trades on foreign-exchange markets happen by way of dollars. Our money has historically been attractive because it is stable. The dominance of U.S. currency throughout the 20th century was deeply connected to this country’s status as a global superpower, free from erratic dictators and seemingly unable to default on its debts.

This has afforded us what the former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing once called our “exorbitant privilege.” As long as the dollar remains dominant, the U.S. has the edge on all other countries when it comes to borrowing, running gargantuan deficits, and imposing sanctions. Last spring’s “Liberation Day” tariffs were an expression of that exorbitant privilege—a way to strong-arm some of our allies. On April 10, a week after the plan was announced, the dollar dropped by about 2 percent. As my colleague Annie Lowrey put it at the time, those tariffs raised questions about “whether the United States deserves to have its privilege revoked.”

A weaker U.S. dollar isn’t necessarily a less dominant dollar. Many have prophesied the end of the dollar’s supremacy, and yet it remains on top. Part of the reason that the currency’s dominance is so hard to shake is that it’s self-perpetuating: Why use something else when so many people, companies, and nations are already using dollars? None of the economists I spoke with suggested that the dollar is in real danger of losing its hegemony, at least not in the near term. And the euro, yen, yuan, and so-called digital gold—bitcoin—are all for various reasons ill-equipped for dominance. (Actual gold, which thrives in times of global insecurity, is having a moment.)

But the president’s distaste for global institutions (such as NATO and the World Health Organization), for existing treaties, and for the alliances the U.S. has enjoyed since World War II has given international-trading partners plenty of reasons to worry about America’s stability. Maurice Obstfeld, another former IMF chief economist, told me that even if no clear successor to the dollar presents itself, “with enough inner geopolitical chaos caused by Trump, and geo-economic chaos, the dollar’s reach would shrink, and the reach of other currencies would rise.” A less dominant dollar would be a particularly dramatic indication of America’s waning status abroad.

The real trouble, in other words, is not that the dollar’s value is getting weaker. It’s the possibility that America’s allies and trading partners may one day cease to respect it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Early in my career, a mother came to my office to discuss her daughter’s calculus grade. When parents make this kind of request, I try to manage expectations by saying that as a school administrator, I have never changed a grade. Still, hopeful parents persist. In this case, the student had received a B, which her mother saw as a blemish on her otherwise spotless transcript. “I’m worried about how this will look to colleges,” she told me. “Is there any extra credit she can do?”

I explained that it’s okay to earn a B in a challenging course, and that her daughter might benefit from the experience of not being perfect. The mother looked at me as if I had suggested her child take up base jumping. “She’s never gotten a B before,” she said. “I don’t know how she’ll handle it.”

That kind of exchange perfectly captures a paradox of contemporary parenting: In trying to protect their children from any hint of failure, many parents risk making them more fragile.

Explore. American milk has more fat than ever, Sarah Zhang writes.

Reflect. Catherine O’Hara brought humanity to over-the-top characters—and managed to wink at the audience in the process, Paula Mejía writes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The four-star Hotel deLuxe in Portland, Oregon, features a soaring lobby with a gilded ceiling that drips with chandeliers. Eileen Mihich, a 31-year-old woman from nearby Beaverton, checked in on the afternoon of March 6, 2025. Two days later, a hotel employee named Stephen Jones noticed that Mihich had failed to check out at the appointed time and went to her eighth-floor room to investigate. No one answered, and the room was silent behind the door, so he let himself in. He found Mihich dead on the bed, with purpling skin. Jones immediately called the police, who noted the empty pill bottles at Mihich’s bedside, along with a pamphlet: “Step-by-Step Instructions for Taking Aid in Dying Medications.”

Mihich had told her family that she was debilitated by a mysterious abdominal pain and was interested in a medically assisted death. But her suicide still shocked her two closest relatives: her cousin Sarah (who asked to be referred to by her first name, to protect her privacy) and aunt Veronica Torina. Sarah and Torina told me that they had striven to be sources of love and stability in Mihich’s harrowing life. Nearly a year on, they are still trying to solve the mystery of her death.

After Sarah and Torina heard the news about Mihich, they went to the hotel to pick up some of her belongings, including a backpack with library-rental DVDs of Matilda and Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, as well as a book on spirituality. At the medical examiner’s office weeks later, they received her phone, her wallet, and pharmacy receipts for prescription drugs commonly used to end the lives of patients with untreatable illnesses.

They also learned that Mihich’s body bore no signs of illness. Mihich had been suffering, but she had not been on the verge of death.

Medical assistance in dying—a euphemism for physician-enabled suicide—has been gaining legislative ground in jurisdictions around the country. Twelve states and Washington, D.C., allow doctors to prescribe lethal dosages of medications to patients with terminal illnesses, and a new law takes effect in New York this year. Most Americans now favor laws that allow doctors to assist patients who want to die, and their numbers have grown over time, according to Gallup. In Canada, where the practice has been legal since 2016, physician-assisted suicide now accounts for about one in 20 deaths.

From the September 2025 issue: Canada is killing itself

For both advocates and opponents of this medically and culturally sanctioned form of suicide, Mihich’s story is a nightmare. The policy debate over medical assistance in dying generally concerns statutory changes, but new laws are encouraging a shift in social norms. When some people in severe distress imagine a peaceful end to what feels like unbearable pain, the availability of medical assistance in dying may shape their thinking, and current safeguards do not seem sufficient to prevent tragic outcomes.

Torina suspects that her niece would still be alive had it been just a little harder for her to secure lethal medication. “She didn’t really want to die, but she felt that she was powerless to create a life worth living. She mentioned that to me on more than one occasion,” Torina told me. Studies show that even minor barriers to suicide, such as selling pills in blister packs and limiting the amount of analgesics that can be sold over the counter, may deter people from ending their life, perhaps because they introduce delays into what can be a rash act. Shortly before her death, Mihich had ordered eye shadow online, which arrived after she was gone. “She was showing signs that she did want to live,” Torina said.

Mihich had been mentally ill for a long time, her relatives said, and she had needed many things that life did not supply her. An only child of negligent parents, Mihich identified with the Roald Dahl character Matilda, a precocious schoolgirl who learns to fend for herself against sometimes cruel adults. Mihich’s parents had screaming fights in front of her, Sarah and Torina recalled, and Mihich alleged that her father, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had raped her when she was a teenager. (Mihich did not pursue the allegations in court, and her father did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Her mother declined to comment.)

After bouncing from foster home to foster home, Mihich was 15 when she fled her last foster parent and arrived on Torina’s doorstep, asking to be taken in. Torina obliged. Mihich’s psychiatrist eventually diagnosed her with bipolar disorder and borderline-personality disorder, the symptoms of which were so severe that she struggled to hold down a job or a home. She vacated one apartment because, Torina recalled, she felt that it emanated negative energy.

Mihich’s relatives said that she often refused to take the medication prescribed to treat her bipolar disorder, and that she nursed semi-delusional beliefs about her capacity to heal herself. She lived on Social Security Disability Insurance and was occasionally homeless. Mihich sometimes told her family about mysterious pains she felt in her pelvic area. Torina wondered whether this was Mihich’s way of expressing the depredations she had suffered as a woman.

Disappointed with mainstream health care, Mihich sought help from energy healers, spiritualists, and other alternative-medicine practitioners and entrepreneurs, who regularly supported her aversion to psychiatric medications, according to Sarah and Torina. All the while, Mihich repeatedly told her family that her pain was so great, she did not want to live. “She would tell me often that she couldn’t do it anymore,” Torina said. “She was too traumatized and broken” to keep on living.

Sarah and Torina understood why Mihich had decided to die. Once her toxicology report came back, they also knew which medications she had used to kill herself. Many of the drugs prescribed for medical assistance in dying are not commonly thought of as vulnerable to abuse. But when death is a possibility, minor errors can have catastrophic consequences.

To understand just how Mihich had secured these medications, Sarah turned to Mihich’s phone. Reviewing her incoming and outgoing calls in the days leading up to her death, Sarah found that Mihich had been in touch with multiple hospice coordinators and loan agencies, as well as a Washington State pharmacist who runs a compounding pharmacy out of a gift shop. Posing as a California family-practice physician under an assumed name, Mihich requested a prescription order form over email, then completed the paperwork and emailed it back—a method of submitting prescriptions that is illegal in Washington and elsewhere, in most cases. She then asked that the pharmacist coordinate via text with her “patient,” and gave her own phone number.

Ultimately Mihich was able to carry out her fraud with publicly available information and relative ease. Unlike conventional pharmacies, which sell only FDA-approved pharmaceuticals, compounding pharmacies are able to sell customized formulations that are not FDA tested and approved.

From the June 2023 issue: The outer limits of liberalism

Compounding pharmacies are the only places capable of dispensing medications that allow for a more peaceful death, as this involves mixing various sedatives, painkillers, and muscle relaxants into something more easily ingested and absorbed. Yet few pharmacists agree to supply these drugs, largely for ethical reasons. Jess Kaan, a Washington-based doctor who works with people seeking end-of-life care, told me that many of her patients have trouble finding a pharmacy that sells this medication, which can make such transactions particularly lucrative for those that do. The drugs Mihich bought cost a little over $2,500, based on her prescription forms, which she likely paid for out of pocket, given regulations that ban the use of federal funds such as Medicaid to cover costs associated with physician-assisted suicide.

To better understand how a pharmacy could have accepted her cousin’s suspicious and invalid prescription, Sarah filed a police report in May. This investigation is ongoing. The pharmacist who supplied Mihich with the drugs that killed her did not respond to requests for comment.

Sarah and Torina knew that Mihich was suffering emotionally and that she had been seeking more permanent relief. But they had assumed that Mihich’s talk of suicide was a way for her to express her misery, not something she was actively pursuing. Torina said they had assumed that Mihich’s aversion to suffering “any more pain” would deter her from making good on any plans. For example, they knew that she had considered starving herself, and that she had acquired a gun explicitly to shoot herself, but that she’d had trouble following through with either method. (They are not sure how she bought the gun.)

Instead, Mihich turned to a suicide approach that is advertised as a dignified way to alleviate pain. Mihich likely did not know that the drugs used to medically induce death do not necessarily guarantee a peaceful exit. In Oregon, where medical assistance in dying has been legal for nearly 30 years, the state’s Health Authority reported in 2024 that the drugs can cause side effects, including seizures, regurgitation, and regaining consciousness after an initial sedation. We can’t know for sure what Mihich experienced, because she died alone.

What we do know is that Mihich found a network of support in her pursuit of a medically assisted death. Her relatives discovered a message on her phone left by a representative of a naturopathic health company called Temple Natural Health, who explained that she had found “a way forward” after discussing Mihich’s case with a hospice-care organization called A Sacred Passing. The message did not include details, and the company did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of A Sacred Passing confirmed that the organization had responded to Mihich’s request for help in seeking medical assistance in dying with “a list of things to do” to get legal medical support—“the ways to reach out and locations to call.” The representative added that she stayed on the phone with Mihich because she sensed that the caller was struggling and needed someone to talk to, but that she didn’t think Mihich would qualify for a medically assisted death.

Eager to bring attention to the loopholes and lapses in judgment that helped end Mihich’s life, Sarah and Torina reached out to a number of organizations that advocate for medical assistance in dying, including the nonprofit Death With Dignity, but received no response. They had more luck when they contacted Aging With Dignity, a nonprofit that advocates against the practice and offers resources to people facing end-of-life problems. This group has worked with Sarah and Torina to create a video about Mihich that helps share her story.

Mihich’s method of suicide was clearly illegal in Oregon, Washington, and elsewhere in the United States, where medical assistance in death is available only to adult patients who are terminally ill, have six months or less to live, and are mentally capable of making their own health-care decisions. But her ability to access fatal drugs is concerning, as the spread of laws allowing medical assistance in dying makes it likely that incidents like this will happen again.

Mihich’s case also raises pressing questions about whether access to an assisted death should extend to people with persistent and severe mental illness—a category of disease that may not be terminal but can be debilitatingly painful. Patients who are suffering from severe psychiatric disorders can already legally seek medical help to end their life elsewhere, including in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and, beginning as soon as 2027, Canada. Yet establishing which psychiatric patients are worthy of this assistance has proved complicated. Authorities in Canada are weighing the case of Claire Brosseau, a 48-year-old woman with severe mental illness who hopes to secure medical help in ending her life but whose own psychiatrists are split over whether her illness is indeed incurable. Many of the country’s top psychiatric groups warn that there is no empirical standard for determining whether a mental-health condition is irremediable.

Advocates who oppose medically assisted suicide—perhaps because they don’t believe the government should play any role in these decisions—may take comfort in the fact that state laws permitting the practice do not currently consider unbearable pain to be a qualifying condition on its own. This makes American laws less vulnerable to arguments that medical assistance in dying should be available for all kinds of suffering, including from psychiatric illness. Yet it may soon be hard to keep these laws narrow, given the logical implications of a growing public acceptance of physician-assisted suicide, which is largely based on the idea that people who want to end their life should not suffer needlessly.

For some, Mihich’s story offers a salient lesson about the importance of greater oversight and tighter regulation of lethal drugs. Others may see in Mihich’s suicide a glimpse of things to come.</div>

that&#39;s going to take _forever_ to scan for corruption

I welcome this new improved data loss mechanism; now instead of losing a terabyte or two, you can lose 140TB all at once.

And that&#39;s because backing up a 140TB drive is a bitch. Backing up a datacenter full of them is worse.

You back it up to another 140TB drive and hope both don&#39;t fail. And then back it up to a third 140TB drive just in case.

I like my g&#39;old reliable HDDs, but HDD technologies seems pretty much stagnant since more than a decade. Today&#39;s a 2TB HD cost pretty much the same as a 2010&#39;s 2TB HD, same speed, same everything.Meanwhile I heard a lot of promises but none of them did hit the shelves.Plus, SSDs got more robust and were getting close to same $/TB of HDs, this trend only stopped due to the recent RAM/Flash shortages (thanks AI big techs).I&#39;d love to see HDDs to make such a comeback, but I&#39;m not holding my breath.

HDDs have also become much more difficult to find at reasonable prices lately. The one I bought in December is now nearly twice as expensive.

I also ordered a decently-priced USB external drive from Amazon in January which didn&#39;t say anything about being out-of-stock but is now saying to expect delivery in March. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll cancel the order at some point because it will probably cost them more than I paid.

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago, and films aren&#39;t far behind. Using AI to make shit faster is kind of fitting really.

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago,

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.

Decades ago, let&#39;s say 30 years to 20 years. Well, 30 years ago was about the first ever show with an entire multi-season story arc plotted out in advance (Babylon 5). There were of course many missteps because literally no one had done it before and the studio had no fucking idea what to do with it. It probably took another 10 years before people finally figured out how to execute su

Some will surely surpass the average tiktoker...

AI doesn&#39;t have to be used to generate the plot, it could be used for say reviewing scripts or first draft edits. Faster than a human, and even though it&#39;s unreliable it may catch some genuine issues that can be corrected before being passed to human review.

Another example would be taking a storyboard or script and using it to make a rough cut, which can then be edited properly.

The danger is that it becomes a crutch. Say the writers are struggling with a scene or a plot point, they turn to AI for ideas, and

So it&#39;s going to be someone&#39;s fap material that stops abruptly because the author reached climax before they could write down all the nonsensical words.

&quot;Amazon Plans To Use AI To Speed Up TV and Film Production&quot;

TRANSLATION: &quot;Amazon Plans To Use AI To Churn Out Shitloads of Utter Garbage&quot;

Have you not watched Fallout?  Amazon has some solid originals.  Bezos may be a greedy dickhead, but his company is making some worthy stuff.Not anymore. It&#39;s all gonna be AI shit produced for pennies.

Have you not watched Fallout?  Amazon has some solid originals.  Bezos may be a greedy dickhead, but his company is making some worthy stuff.

Not anymore. It&#39;s all gonna be AI shit produced for pennies.

So no matter how quickly you can make a movie, it still takes an 80-100 or whatever minutes to watch it.

So they need more consumers. This is where agents come in.

They just need to convince people to want to own a series of robots to be entertained for them. I&#39;m sure they could come up with a &quot;vibe-viewing&quot; UI to managing your little virtual popcorn-eaters - maybe Nintendo could help, they&#39;re good at that sort of thing.

And then kids could humiliate each other over how much media their peers are wasting without experiencing.

It will be quite impossible to mass-produce individually rendered streams of AI slops at a cost that is acceptable to the punter.

And beyond. Such a thing won&#39;t pay for itself.

Just like manned flight will never be possible, no one will ever be able to harness the power of nuclear forces, and no one will ever be able to go to the Moon.

Sounds about right for Hollywood these days. Gonna fire up some Gilligan&#39;s Island tonight. At least slop made in the 60&#39;s was still watchable.

Their wording specifically sounds like they&#39;re not working on tools where you can &quot;prompt your way into a movie,&quot; but rather tools that are designed to act as a force multiplier on creatives&#39; labor.

I saw a demo video involving anime about a year ago. The tool basically allowed a single artist to draw out their animation and then tell the model to go through frame-by-frame and clean up rough edges and stuff like that. Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.

Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.But how will these low-paid artists learn their craft???Wait, this is Slashdot:  AI is taking away jobs of entry-level programmers.  How will entry-level programmers learn their craft?

Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.

But how will these low-paid artists learn their craft???

Wait, this is Slashdot:  AI is taking away jobs of entry-level programmers.  How will entry-level programmers learn their craft?

&quot;Hollywood fears that AI will cut jobs and permanently reshape the industry.&quot;

First, there are no studios in Hollywood, second, thousands of model makers lost their jobs to CGI and nobody made a fuss.

That was shitty in the beginning as well, it will be the same thing here, just with higher resolution from the get-go.

I have solved the tv and movie problem.  I&#39;ve trained my AI to watch all the shows for me, and now I have tons of free time to do more pleasant things.

The good news. Creative people can use the AI tools to realize their ideas without the staff or money required to do it the old way.The bad news. Artless mercenaries will be able to churn out overwhelming quantities of crap faster, cheaper and easier.

Throughout all of history advances in technology have been primarily billed at making it easier to make movies. From the move to miniature sets, digital cameras, different technologies for separating characters from backgrounds, e.g. green screening existed to speed up rotoscoping...

AI is a tool. Of course it was going to be used in Hollywood. They&#39;ve attempted to use literally everything ever developed to help speed up film making.

I also have a Nook for new releases before I&#39;ve decided if they&#39;re worth taking up space on my shelves for. I&#39;ll purchase the real book if it feels like something I&#39;d like to read again. But I do not, and can not, justify a Spot

hey musicians, they&#39;re doing this with YOUR money.

If you already have the physical book, why would you want to suddenly jump to an audio version of it?  I can&#39;t see that market being huge.  The only scenario I can think of is if you are reading the book, and you want to continue &#39;listening&#39; to it when you can&#39;t read it (driving in a car, etc.)   Most people I know (including myself) are kind of one way or another, they either like reading real books, or listening to audio books.   I&#39;m a real book person, but I do listen to a number of podcasts by authors o

Audio books have never made sense to me, even if I could point out where in an audio clip I want to go.  That&#39;s b&#39;cos I read faster than what anyone can talk, and sometimes, I may not understand one&#39;s pronunciation of certain words.  But I do prefer e-books to slaughtered trees: it saves me from having to have shelves, where those books can gather dust, pages can rot...  As opposed to that, I can have electronic copies of books on my Nook app, or on my iPad, or even, if I want, on storage media.  Searching

Because it would be unusable. Lockdown mode is pretty severe [apple.com], it&#39;s not something you want to deal with day to day.I am reading through the list in your link and I don&#39;t get it - what part of this is supposed to be &quot;unusable&quot;?

I am reading through the list in your link and I don&#39;t get it - what part of this is supposed to be &quot;unusable&quot;?

Despite what you claim you clearly didn&#39;t read the link the GP posted. It&#39;s a massive list of stuff that&#39;s disabled that people would find an iDevice barely useful without.

When Lockdown Mode is enabled, some apps and features will function differently, including:

Messages: most message attachment types are blocked, other than certain images, video and audio. Some features, such as links and link previews, will be unavailable.

Web browsing: certain complex web technologies are blocked, which may cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts may not be displayed, and images may be repla

They just need to make each one of those a toggle. I&#39;d turn quite a few of those on.

I don&#39;t want random FaceTime, so I&#39;d turn that on. I don&#39;t want location data in shared photos (or really to even accidentally share photos). I&#39;m fine with not getting invitations for apple services, I don&#39;t want those. I don&#39;t use configuration profiles, so I&#39;d like to remove the risk I accidentally add one. I don&#39;t want link previews in iMessage

I&#39;ve been using Lockdown mode since it has came out.  Yes, one can&#39;t just click on links sent to you via text, and it can be a PITA to browse some websites, especially those with brain-dead anti-adblocker stuff that considers Lockdown Mode an adblocker.  However, overall, it works well enough, and the security benefits are worth it, IMHO.

I just wish websites would understand that many Apple users use it.  I use it across all my Apple devices, just as protection from zero click attacks.

Presumably to avoid users accidentally bricking their phone due to a security snafu.

The comments here should be interesting. What’s the venn diagram of the pro encryption group and the “these boots are so tasty when the stand on liberals” group look like? I suspect the boots so tasty crowd remains silent.

I&#39;m not sure how much longer there will be journalists in the US. There is no shortage of independent journalists. Just go to substack.

you, yes YOU, have supported the most divisive figure in american political history since the civil war and gonna sit here and pretend like you care about it now? fuck all the way off please

that aside im curious, do you prefer to ingest the boot toe or heel first? what type of wine pairing do you like?

> However, reasonable people a) would agree that going after journalists to uncover confidential source is not good for free speech regardless of the context, b) would agree that right against self-incrimination should not disappear just because it is &quot;on a computer&quot; or &quot;on a phone&quot;

I must have missed the massive protests from Republicans about this then if the first part of your comment is correct. You ARE claiming Republicans do share the views you attribute to &quot;reasonable people&quot;, correct?

Links? I can&#39;t find a single case of any of these people even bringing this up.

You shouldn&#39;t finish your popcorn before the movie starts.

Right in your link it says Biden cooperated with officials during the investigation. Do you see the difference?

> A former senator and vice president does not have the same authority to declassify docs as they see fir. See the difference?

No. Because a former President doesn&#39;t have any authority to declassify docs either. And the former President you&#39;re defending here did NOT cooperate with the FBI despite &quot;being caught red handed.&quot;

I&#39;m okay with putting Biden in prison. But let&#39;s go after the kingpin and current threat before we go after the small fries that current hold no authority.

You give them far too much credit. If they had gained access they would be bragging about it.

But, if they did that, they would not get to keep the phone which is what they were arguing, no? ...perhaps I misread that...

Even if they did unlawfully keep the phone, what court is going to enforce judgement to return it?

Or they will use &quot;parallel construction&quot; and get away with straight up lying in court.

Just because the authorities claim something does not mean it&#39;s true, this may simply be the disinformation they need people to believe. For all we know, it might just be a red herring and a red flag.I came to say exactly this. I still think the odds favour the supposition that they&#39;re telling the truth - but I wouldn&#39;t bet much money on either side.

Well, not _forever_ ... my iPod said it was locked for another 23508980 minutes, in december 2014. I will just have to remember the code by August 25, 2059

On Friday night, a federal court in Virginia unsealed a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit that provides the FBI’s sworn statement justifying its request to search the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. In the search, the government seized two laptops, Natanson’s phone, a voice recorder, and other electronic devices.
 ... 
“In its affidavit, the government did not reference the federal law that prohibits, with few exceptions, raids targeting journalists or newsrooms to seize unpublished work. The government appears to have ignored a crucial press freedom guardrail in searching a journalist’s home and did not alert the magistrate judge to the law’s application in this case, let alone show how or if it had complied with the statute’s considerable protections.”
 
That federal law is the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which created essential protections for journalists and newsrooms from government searches and seizures. Congress passed it out of concern that such raids could stanch the free flow of information to the public.

What constitution? It was on life support before Roe vs Wade was overturned despite a complete lack of new legislation or a constitutional amendment to back that up (even Dred Scott needed a constitutional amendment to over turn its precedent), and the current administration is ignoring it outside of token &quot;Pretend Congress still has some power&quot; stuff.

The US Constitution is toilet paper right now. The next democratic (small D) government should have a new one ready to go that has the major holes in the curr

This is why you don&#39;t let this stuff slide, even when the guy doing it is popular and seemingly benign. The next guy might not be, and once the door is open...

Damn. It took a whole 40 minutes between the first post and your post for someone to come up with the fact that search warrants against journalists should never be issued to find their sources. Kudos.

This should have been the first topic to be discussed, instead of &quot;Apple ads&quot; and technology stuff. Police states and totalitarian regimes go after journalists sources. Freedom of press is paramount in a democracy.

Hoist with his own petard. Just desserts for a flimflam that sold a crufty copy of a copy of OS he ripped off. Added window dressing but ignored its horrible security for decadesm His sales team pushed half-baked products into law enforcement, banking, government, and much of the corporate world; despite its glaring technical inadequacies.

It&#39;s tough to initiate that when you&#39;re not certain when a device will fall into the wrong hangs. A lock down plus time out for self erase might be a reasonable compromise.

My old friend used to put a hundreds of fake URLs that he monitored as a canary or trip wire (I forgot what he called it). The longish path to a fake file was unlikely to be found accidentally, but if someone access his device and attempted to access the links that would inadvertently alert him. This can be helpful for detecting a remote attack, or knowing when an agency successfully unlocked a device. With the intention that he&#39;d get a lawyer to go after any improper procedure to reach an acquittal

Theoretically if the pool of money was big enough and the float between deposits and payouts spread some that does not have to be the case.

The insurance industry for instance does not operate collecting more premiums than their casualty costs. Just like a bank lends out some of its deposits to earn interest lending, on the assumption not everyone will want to withdraw from their savings at once, insurers generally invest the capital and in many seconds of the insurance most the profit comes from the investm

Ease up on the comedy this early in the morning. I&#39;ve barely got my coffee down.The insurance industry soaks up money like a sponge. They throw most of it at executive get-aways. Mom&#39;s last husband was an insurance dude, and the company sent him on two to four &quot;retreats&quot; a year, where he met up with literally hundreds of other salesmen and executives. And it was always places like Machu Pichu, Rome, or other high-dollar places, and they weren&#39;t staying in the no-tell hotels.

Did I say they don&#39;t make a ton of money?

No I simply said the business model is not &#39;collect more premium than total casualty payments&#39; which is not.

Depending on the sector a lot of insurers target a combined ratio under 100, that is they do infact collect a small amount of premium beyond their casualty costs and expense, but again the major source of their profitability is still investment income on those premiums while they hold them. Commercial insurance operates much more like a bank than a government r

No one should go around arguing, &quot;I only play FanDuel because I don&#39;t lose as much money.&quot;

Why? If you&#39;re doing it to make money you&#39;re an idiot. If you&#39;re doing it for entertainment then you should prefer the system that gives you the most entertainment for your money.

The claim in the summary is different though. The bottom quarter, not everybody, apparently lost more money on Kalshi than Fan Duel. If you believe there&#39;s actual skill involved then that suggests skilled users would make more money on Kalshi.

Yes, I&#39;m puzzled by this &quot;revelation&quot;. Of course the bottom 25% lose money. That&#39;s how the bottom 25% is defined.

OTOH, Chinese might be better than Sony.  They sold their souls so long ago that I can&#39;t remember the last of their products I bought.  Once upon a time they had a name for quality, but then they sold their soul to Hollywood.

Their OLED Bravia &quot;master&quot; line of TVs are actually really nice.  They edge out LG in picture quality due to a superior image processing pipeline, and the fit and finish is a little better, IMO.  You pay through the nose for it though.  Hopefully that secret sauce went over to TCL with the sale of the brand.

Mindless hate, is what it is. Anything China does is an attack on us, in some people&#39;s minds.

Sony has been on the brink of exiting the TV business for many, many years already. The margins are thin, the competition is great, and nobody makes panels in Japan anymore. Sony has relied on superior image processing to maintain its position, but the Korean and Chinese models are very competitive now.

Rare earths are an interesting one. They gave a lot of hints about Trump knocking off the bullshit, or they would constrain the supply of them to the US in response. Trump didn&#39;t knock it off, and they did. Hard to blame them for issuing a clear warning over many years, and finally following through on it when it was ignored.

If it was all some 4 decade long nefarious scheme, spanning generations of politicians, why did they make so much effort to telegraph the fact that they were going to do it? Why send ministers to go and inspect rare earth refineries immediately after Trump says this stuff?

The first paragraph actually explains all this stupidity:

From 2000 to 2009, China&#39;s production of rare earth elements increased 77 percent to 129,000 tons, while production from other reserves dropped to around 3000 tons.[5] Large US mining companies such as Molycorp closed due to the mix of China&#39;s abundance of rare earths and their capacities for production, as well as the cost of labor and stringent environmental regulations during the Nixon era.[6] With the decreased pool of competitors, China&#39;s hold on these elements gave them a lot of power in the distribution of these commodities. The government declared these elements to be a protected and strategic good in 1990.[5] This decision had a significant impact on foreign industries who partnered with China. Foreign investors could no longer work with rare earths except when partnered with Chinese firms.[5] The State Development and Planning Commission gained power, as all projects needed their approval.[5] Production quotas were instigated for the miners and oftentimes quotas would be surpassed because of illegal mining by people who did not have licenses.[5]In other words, China just has more of them, and especially in the 90s the environmental regulations were more lax, and the US didn&#39;t think them strategic enough to bother protecting the industry. China did though, they made sure that they were not pillaged like other countries had been by foreign companies coming in.

It&#39;s not really China&#39;s fault that jobs moved there. It wasn&#39;t just undercutting wages either, they built unrivalled manufacturing supply chains and support. If I want a complex PCB prototyped here, I get quotes for 6 week as an expensive rush job. Chinese manufacturers quote 6 days, including airmail to my door.

If anyone is to blame, it&#39;s the wealthy who screwed up our economies to suit themselves. Productivity gains were not passed on to workers. Socialism was treated as a dirty word, taking away cheaper

Can&#39;t seize what was willingly given away.

Sony chose to give up the market to others.

Sad to see, but as they say, &quot;all good things..&quot;

Thought they could drop the quality and people would still keep buying simply because of the brand name. Shame no one told them that the world doesn&#39;t work like that any more (except maybe in high fashion but those people are just morons anyway).

What I think he was saying, although it&#39;s hard to be sure, is that Sony already dropped quality.

Sony hwardware started losing quality against other japanese brands - never mind the koreans - about 25 years ago when chinese electronics were still domestic market cheap shit only.

Shame no one told them that the world doesn&#39;t work like that any more (except maybe in high fashion but those people are just morons anyway).Sony wasn&#39;t particularly good in quality to begin with... See: the Sony Timer. It just had a brand following which it&#39;s been shedding year after year. 

Quality wise, the Koreans came in and ate their lunch, price wise the Chinese are eating everyone else&#39;s lunch.

I guess you weren&#39;t around in the 80s or were young because Sony hifi back then was top notch and it stayed that way until the early 2000s. Then it was downhill fast.

Since Sony owns Bungie now, I thought this was an oblique way of saying that China had seized ownership of them! (Yes I know MS retains ownership of Halo, but still)

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get any stranger, the Trump administration has injected abortion law into its efforts to stamp out anti-ICE protests. Last week, Don Lemon, an independent reporter, and two protesters were arrested on federal charges arising out of an anti–Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest at a Minnesota church. One of the key charges involves the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, legislation passed in 1993 to protect access to reproductive health facilities and places of worship. Understanding the law’s past and present reveals how the Department of Justice has repurposed it to crack down on protest that the president opposes.

The FACE Act passed at a time of escalating anti-abortion protest. Abortion opponents had watched as Republican presidents reshaped the U.S. Supreme Court, but abortion remained legal. Frustrations spilled over, and a growing number of Americans joined clinic blockades led by Operation Rescue, a group that sought to shut down abortion clinics. As Time magazine reported, the primary tactic Operation Rescue used was “to jam all entrances to an abortion clinic before the police can muster sufficient officers to begin arrests.”

Operation Rescue members did get arrested but often faced minor charges, like trespassing, before quickly returning to the protest front lines. Most of those who attended these protests were peaceful—Operation Rescue instructed recruits on what it called nonviolent civil disobedience. But the group’s message was that lawbreaking was justified in the name of saving the lives of the unborn.

That message was hard to contain, and by 1993, anti-abortion extremists were arguing that it was legitimate to use violence against providers. That year saw the first of a series of murders of abortion doctors. Congress responded with the FACE Act, which sought to distinguish peaceful protest and speech (much of which is protected under the First Amendment) from violence, threats of force, and efforts to obstruct access to clinics. Sponsored by Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Constance Morella, the law drew inspiration partly from a federal law already protecting “interference with rights,” including religious exercise.

The addition of places of worship was meant to doom passage of the act at a time when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress; a staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (the now-prominent conservative Ed Whelan) added the language as a poison pill. There was also a plan to mock the bill if it passed: Whelan hoped that the addition would change the acronym for the law to the FARCE Act.

But Kennedy was in favor of the addition in no small part because of the historic victimization of Black churches, synagogues, and other places of worship—a trend that was all too evident in several mass shootings last year. If anything, the tactic cemented the bill’s bipartisan appeal: Seventeen Republican senators and three members of the House ultimately supported it.

Abortion opponents immediately challenged the law’s constitutionality under the First Amendment, arguing that the statute censored speech and singled out abortion foes for prosecution. The courts rejected that argument by stressing that the FACE Act was narrow: It applied only to conduct and was enforced regardless of what message protesters intended to convey. Constitutional arguments against the act have reemerged since the demise of Roe v. Wade, with the CATO Institute arguing that there may no longer be any congressional authority for the law and that it may thus be unconstitutional.

The FACE Act had a major impact on the clinic blockade movement, which relied on a large number of recruits to stop patients from entering abortion clinics. Rather than minor trespassing charges, protesters now weighed the prospect of serious fines and prison time, with penalties escalating for repeat offenders.

But the line between speech and obstruction, threats, or violence can sometimes be messy to draw in context. That meant that federal prosecutors were often reluctant to bring FACE Act charges, even when Democrats were in office. With Joe Biden in the White House, federal prosecutors did file charges against not only anti-abortion groups like Red Rose Rescue (a next-generation clinic blockade group) but also Jane’s Revenge, a militant abortion-rights group that carried out a campaign of vandalism, arson, and bombing.

Fast-forward to 2026, when the FACE Act is enjoying a bizarre renaissance. Over the years, bipartisan consensus about the legislation collapsed, and conservative Republicans began calling for its repeal. Then, in January 2025, a spokesperson for the Trump administration announced that the White House would no longer enforce the FACE Act absent “extraordinary circumstances” or “significant aggravating factors.” Abortion opponents clearly see this announcement as an opportunity. Randall Terry, the 77-year-old founder of Operation Rescue, is working with his girlfriend, Terrisa Bukovinac, the 44-year-old leader of a group called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, to launch a new wave of protests and reach a younger generation of potential recruits.

But “extraordinary circumstances” might not be as hard for the administration to find when the president doesn’t like what protesters are saying. The White House has turned its FACE Act focus toward language protecting places of worship from those who interfere with religious exercise “by force or threat of force or physical obstruction” to target messages that the administration opposes.

First came an indictment against a group of pro-Palestinian protesters and organizations arising from a November 2024 demonstration outside a New Jersey synagogue. Organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and American Muslims for Palestine New Jersey, the protest targeted an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. What happened next is unclear, but violence broke out between the protesters and pro-Israel counterprotesters. New Jersey prosecutors concluded that pro-Israel demonstrators were the first to cross the line into violence, and the Department of Justice disagreed. Either way, it seemed to be a strange choice for an administration that had announced a lack of interest in enforcing the FACE Act to prioritize a case in which local law enforcement saw the facts so differently.

Now the administration is pursuing similar charges against Don Lemon. The former CNN anchor and his co-defendants faced charges based on an anti-ICE protest at Cities Church, a site that was chosen because protesters believed its pastor to be the acting director of a local ICE field office. At the time, 3,000 ICE agents had flooded the Twin Cities, and Renee Good had recently been shot and killed by federal immigration officials. Alex Pretti would be killed later in the ICE surge.

Prosecutors claim that Lemon, a noted critic of the president, helped organize the Cities Church protest, which they frame as an attack. The indictment charges that Lemon then obstructed church members from leaving by posting himself at the door and asking them questions.

Based on the available evidence, it’s hard to see these charges as anything but disturbing and wrong. Video of the incident shows heated exchanges between Lemon and his interview subjects, who clearly disagree with him about immigration policy and the conduct of ICE in the Twin Cities. There are moments when the journalist is asked to leave, or when the people to whom he’s speaking clearly want to move on. And people do leave, including the ones Lemon seems to aggravate the most. The video doesn’t show much more physical contact than Lemon pushing his microphone into the subjects’ faces. If that act qualifies as physical obstruction, it’s hard to see what kind of press scrum would not.

Drawing the line between protected speech and obstruction or threats isn’t always straightforward. And even when the line is clear, protests about everything from ICE to abortion often involve civil disobedience like trespassing. Those protests can involve speech that is rude, unconvincing, or even hateful. But the line between protected speech and wrongful conduct can’t depend on the reasons people are protesting. With this latest prosecution, that’s just the danger we face.

            <h2>Most SAP migrations bust budgets and project timelines, research finds</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/sap_migrations_research/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 60 percent of SAP migration projects are delayed and over budget as organizations underestimate complexity, allow expansion of scope, and fail to understand internal constraints, according to research from ISG.

The survey of 200 senior decision-makers in large global companies also found that fewer than one in five organizations reimplement SAP processes and technology when they move to the latest platform, S/4HANA.

Nearly half (49 percent) carry out little or no re-engineering, choosing instead to preserve legacy processes and data.

The research comes as SAP users face the support deadline for ECC, the legacy ERP platform still used by thousands of the world&#39;s largest businesses. By the end of 2027, mainstream support is stopping while extended support at a 2 percent premium will be available until the end of 2030. SAP has also discussed another support option beyond 2030 so long as customers sign up to its migration commercials ahead of that date.

Gartner data shows 39 percent of SAP&#39;s 35,000 ECC customers worldwide had yet to migrate as of Q4 2024, nearly a decade after S/4HANA launched in 2015.

Yet the majority of the largest organizations are still failing to stick to budgets and timelines with migration to S/4HANA.

Michael Dornan, ISG principal analyst, said even simply moving their current processes to a new platform, organizations struggled with making a plan and sticking to it.

&quot;Some of them are trying to do this quickly, a lift-and-shift as fast and cheap as possible. This group often underestimated the complexity, scope and the constraints they have. They also suffer from scope creep and changing requirements as they go through. A lot of the delays are caused by people, not necessarily the technology.&quot;

According to the research, 34 percent of organizations were opting for &quot;brownfield&quot; migrations. Eighteen percent wanted to adopt a greenfield strategy, embracing standard processes in SAP&#39;s preferred &quot;clean core&quot; approach. Nearly half, however, were mixing the two approaches, so-called &quot;bluefield.&quot; A muddy field, The Register might suggest.

Dornan said more than half the survey respondents agreed they had over-customized legacy ERP to the point where standardization now feels risky to the business.

&quot;That&#39;s the fear they go through. If you standardize, then you just start that whole process again. There are a lot of stakeholders in the business that actually felt that their old ERP was doing the job that they wanted to, which creates inertia,&quot; he said.

The report states that brownfield and hybrid approaches might limit long-term benefits and make it more difficult to adopt newer technologies such as AI.

&quot;Fragmented processes, extensive customizations, and legacy data structures often constrain which AI use cases can be effectively deployed after go-live. By contrast, environments with standardized processes and well-governed data are better positioned to realize the automation, forecasting, and operational efficiency gains enterprises expect.&quot;

However, businesses are carefully weighing up the risks and refusing to be dictated by the vendors&#39; timelines.

Of the total sample of SAP ERP users, eight percent planned to stay on ECC beyond 2027 while around two-thirds were still in the planning stage for migration, making it unlikely they would make the cutoff for mainstream support.

The trend is borne out elsewhere. Airbus, for example, currently runs a patchwork of SAP versions, including legacy SAP R/3 4.6 and ECC 6.0 systems. While some divisions – finance, materials management, and parts of Airbus Helicopters – have already moved to S/4HANA, the bulk of the migration lies ahead. The company told The Register it may not be finished by 2030.

Like thousands of other SAP users, it is trying to find the right balance between the risks of changing and the risks of staying the same. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Breach-tracking site Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) claims a cyberattack on Betterment affected roughly 1.4 million users – although the investment company has yet to publicly confirm how many customers were affected by January&#39;s intrusion.

The figure surfaced today after HIBP added the incident to its database. HIBP says the dataset tied to the attack contains approximately 1.4 million unique email addresses, along with partial personal information that aligns with details previously acknowledged by the fintech firm.

Betterment, which offers automated investment and financial planning services, first disclosed the breach in January after detecting unauthorized access to certain internal systems on January 9. Betterment said the hacker gained entry through a social engineering scheme that relied on impersonation to infiltrate third-party marketing and operations tools, then used that access to send customers a fraudulent cryptocurrency promotion disguised as an official company message.

In its most recent customer update, published on February 3, Betterment said the intrusion did not expose customer accounts, passwords, or login credentials, and the fallout involved customer contact details, including names and email addresses. For a subset of users, the accessed data also included additional information such as physical mailing addresses, phone numbers, or dates of birth.

It is working with an independent data analytics provider to review material allegedly posted online by a group claiming responsibility for the breach. While Betterment hasn&#39;t said who was behind the incident, the notorious ShinyHunters crew recently told The Register that it gained access to Betterment&#39;s systems by voice phishing its Okta single sign-on codes.

The extortion group claimed to have leaked 20 million Betterment records, but its dark web leak site was offline at the time of publication.

Betterment did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s questions.

While Betterment has stressed that investment accounts and authentication data were not touched, exposure of contact and identity-related details still carries risk. Such datasets are prized by phishing campaigns and account takeover attempts, particularly when tied to financial services users.

Betterment advises customers to be skeptical of unsolicited emails or calls. It says it won&#39;t ask for passwords or financial information via unsolicited messages.

The incident also serves as a useful reminder that while companies like Betterment automate investing, they still collect plenty of personal data that attackers are keen to get their hands on. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft says &quot;reliability is the priority&quot; for AI in Visual Studio – a reassurance that may raise eyebrows among developers already living with Copilot&#39;s quirks.

Microsoft has been relentlessly shoveling AI assistants into its venerable code wrangler in recent years, but has now stated: &quot;We&#39;re shifting focus to reliability and refinement.&quot;

Sadly, that focus does not extend to dealing with the occasionally clunky and bloated set of tools that have evolved over decades. Instead, Microsoft is focusing on &quot;tightening core workflows, improving agent stability, and building on the MCP foundations we&#39;ve been laying.&quot;

While the company was careful not to commit to delivering anything, it said it was working to keep Copilot rapid as context grows, kicking off early work to integrate the Copilot CLI into Visual Studio Copilot, and taking initial steps toward a dedicated agent for multi-step task planning and execution.

It also said it would handle scenarios where Copilot and IntelliSense trip over each other or where suggestions appear at the same time. &quot;To resolve these conflicts, we will prioritize IntelliSense completions over Copilot suggestions as it&#39;s more predictable and a loved feature.&quot;

IntelliSense first appeared in Visual Basic 5 a full 30 years ago, although the concept of code completion predates it. Where Copilot attempts to generate useful code snippets, IntelliSense focuses on basic code completion.

In 2023, Microsoft announced that IntelliSense in Visual Studio would &quot;steer&quot; GitHub Copilot based on a developer&#39;s selection in IntelliSense&#39;s list.

While Microsoft&#39;s declaration that it will prioritize reliability and IntelliSense completions over Copilot suggestions will be welcomed, there are plenty of facets in the suite that could use attention, but don&#39;t fall under the category of AI features.

This was articulated in a comment on Microsoft&#39;s announcement:

&quot;I know a small percentage of people are interested in AI, but why must all concentration be on shoe-horning it into every products [sic] when there is so much else that needs to be done?

&quot;SDKs are buggy and incomplete (MAUI/WinUI3 etc), yet get absolutely no love whatsoever. Hundreds of genuine problems and/or enhancements remain outstanding for Visual Studio and all M$ is looking at is damned Co-Pilot.&quot;

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government claims it will develop a &quot;world-first&quot; framework to evaluate deepfake detection technologies as AI-generated content proliferates.

The Home Office is working with Microsoft, other tech corporations and academics to assess methods for identifying harmful forgeries. It estimates eight million deepfakes were shared in 2025, up from half a million in 2023.

Nik Adams, Deputy Commissioner for City of London Police, called the framework &quot;a strong and timely addition to the UK&#39;s response to the rapidly evolving threat posed by AI and deepfake technologies.&quot;

&quot;By rigorously testing deepfake technologies against real-world threats and setting clear expectations for industry, this framework will significantly bolster law enforcement&#39;s ability to stay ahead of offenders, protect victims and strengthen public confidence as these technologies continue to evolve.&quot;

However, Dr Ilia Kolochenko, CEO at ImmuniWeb, a Swiss cybersecurity biz, said the plan &quot;will quite unlikely make any systemic improvements in the near future.&quot;

Kolochenko pointed to numerous open source tools and groups of experts that already exist to track and expose AI-generated content.

&quot;Even if an AI fake is detected, the biggest question is what to do next,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;Reputable media and websites will likely take it down rapidly even without scientific proof that it is an AI fake.&quot;

Clandestine or anonymous media are unlikely to be as cooperative.

&quot;We need a systemic and global amendment of legislation – not just legally unenforceable code of conduct or best practices – to stop the surging harm of AI-created content,&quot; Kolochenko added. &quot;In sum, while this commendable action is a solid start, we are still very far from a final solution.&quot;

The Register asked the Home Office for a time frame for the framework and the technology being used, but did not receive a response. Microsoft directed us to the Home Office&#39;s statement. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has made OneDrive agents generally available, allowing users to query multiple documents simultaneously through Copilot instead of just one at a time.

Users can select up to 20 files and create an agent, saved as a .agent file in OneDrive.

Rather than teasing information out of individual documents, Microsoft says users can make cross-document queries, including &quot;What decisions have we made so far?&quot; and &quot;What risks keep coming up?&quot; The agent then generates a response based on the documents&#39; content.

Agents can be searched for and shared, although collaborators will need access to the source documents. Microsoft said: &quot;The agent can provide complete, grounded responses keeping everyone aligned without extra handoffs.&quot;

However, the claim that getting started &quot;requires no special admin setup,&quot; combined with the lack of detail about what the agents do behind the scenes or where user data ends up, is likely to worry administrators. That said, for a user of OneDrive on the web with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, that ship has long sailed.

The Register asked Microsoft about the privacy implications and what happens to user data while an agent does its thing, but other than acknowledging our question, the company did not respond.

Copilot meddling with OneDrive files is not new. Microsoft showed off a variety of concepts in 2023 and revealed updates in 2024. Users who don&#39;t want a perky virtual assistant that might occasionally make potentially catastrophic errors don&#39;t have to use the functionality.

However, for organizations that have bought into Microsoft&#39;s vision of a Copilot-powered future, the functionality may be worth checking out. It makes queries more targeted and collaborative than simply applying AI to OneDrive.

There are some intriguing opportunities for collaboration, however, it is up to the user to make sure that anyone with whom an agent is shared has access to the same source files. Otherwise, there is an even greater chance that Copilot might be confidently wrong. Or, as Microsoft put it: &quot;If someone opens the agent but doesn&#39;t have access to the source files, they won&#39;t get useful answers.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">PC buyers can expect price hikes as chipmakers continue to prioritize AI production over all else, restricting the supply of key components across the tech industry.

Analyst Context says existing inventory initially buffered markets across Europe, however, prices are inflating as older stock depletes - and it forecasts further inflation as the year progresses.

The average UK distributor consumer desktop price, for example, rose almost eight percent year-on-year in the five weeks of 2026 to £565 ($767), while laptops edged up 1.1 percent to £454 ($619) &quot;reflecting continued sell-through of stock purchased before component costs escalated.&quot;

Counterpoint Research said today that memory prices have soared 80 to 90 percent this year versus Q4, with DRAM, NAND, and HBM all hitting new highs.

Constraints on specific configurations, alongside emerging CPU availability issues, are expected to limit choice and increase pricing pressure from Q2 onward, according to Context.

&quot;Manufacturers are prioritizing production for AI datacenter infrastructure, redirecting capacity away from consumer-grade memory and storage towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced storage required for large-scale AI workloads,&quot; said senior retail analyst James Bates.

New fabrication plants are being built to supply more of the memory that PC makers need, but these typically take several years to come online.

US chipmaker Micron recently started work on a mega chip fab in New York state, which isn&#39;t scheduled to begin producing DRAM chips before 2030. Micron did, however, seal the deal on an existing facility in Taiwan that could be delivering chips sometime next year.

The situation is so dire that major PC brands including HP, Dell, Acer, and Asus are considering sourcing memory chips from Chinese manufacturers for the first time, according to Nikkei Asia.

HP and Dell have already started qualifying chips from ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), it says, with HP planning to follow suit if the outlook does not improve around the middle of the year.

And it isn&#39;t just PCs – servers are also affected. Analyst Omdia said this week that server CPU prices could go up by 11 to 15 percent due to supply problems, while Samsung Electronics and SK hynix were reportedly raising server memory prices by as much as 70 percent this quarter.

The blast radius from the memory shortages is impacting other areas of the industry such as smartphones. Prices could bounce 6 to 8 percent, disproportionately affecting the low end of the market.

Smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm saw its share price take a hit after it warned of slower sales ahead, as did chip designer Arm, which estimated lower growth in royalty revenue for the next quarter, all due to a shortage of enough memory to go in the devices people want to buy.

With all these side effects from the AI infrastructure boom, it seems we are all going to pay the price for AI, whether we use it or not. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is celebrating 25 years of Xbox with new games, hardware, and more.

Microsoft is celebrating 25 years of Xbox with new games, hardware, and more.

Microsoft has a big year ahead for Xbox as it marks its 25-year milestone. After the tough decision to release more Xbox games on rival consoles two years ago, 2026 is a chance to refocus on the platform and celebrate some of Xbox’s biggest franchises. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to define its vision for the future of Xbox, after months of confusion from fans and plummeting Xbox hardware sales.

Xbox kicked off 2026 with its annual Developer Direct last month, a preview of some of the games it’s publishing this year. Microsoft is lining up its “four horsemen” for 2026: Forza, Halo, Fable, and Gears of War. These franchises have been the driving force behind Microsoft’s own Xbox games over the past 25 years, and I’m told there’s a big effort internally to ensure all four games debut on time this year.

Forza Horizon 6 is first up on May 19th, and sources at Microsoft tell me that Halo: Campaign Evolved is tentatively targeting release over the summer. Microsoft is planning to release Fable in the fall, with Gears of War: E-Day also scheduled for the second half of 2026. I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it’s also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI’s November 19th date. Rockstar’s modern day Vice City could still slip further, but Take-Two announced this week that marketing for Grand Theft Auto VI is due to start in the summer.

Outside of the big four, I understand Double Fine is also preparing to launch its new Kiln game in April. Bethesda is also working on new content for Starfield that looks set to debut soon. I wouldn’t be surprised if we also hear about a PS5 version of Starfield, years after it was first rumored. Don’t be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change — such is the reality of video game development.

Blizzard is also celebrating 35 years, with a series of showcases for World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Diablo. Overwatch 2 is now back to being just Overwatch, and there are plans for 10 new heroes over the course of the year, new maps, and more.

Fallout fans are also desperate for news about the Fallout 3 remaster we heard about in FTC documents from 2023, or news of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster. The Fallout season 2 TV show finale debuted on Tuesday, and many fans were hoping a countdown website was hinting at a Fallout 3 remaster. The game is still in active development, and I understand Bethesda is keen to ensure it’s as well polished as the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered last year.

Beyond Xbox games, 2026 is also an important year for Microsoft’s Xbox hardware and software platforms. The release of the Xbox Ally handhelds from Asus last year marked a new effort to bring Windows and Xbox closer together. This model of third-party devices now looks like the future of Xbox hardware and software.

Microsoft is working on several improvements to the Xbox “full screen experience” that powers the Xbox Ally devices. An Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature, which uses an NPU to upscale games, is set to debut in the coming months for the Xbox Ally X. Microsoft is also planning to use the NPU inside the Xbox Ally X to launch a new highlight reel feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay and make it easy to share the footage on social media.

An improved Xbox PC UI is also being developed. It’s based on the changes Microsoft has been testing in the new desktop mode for Xbox Cloud Gaming. It features a floating Xbox guide interface and smooth animations, and I expect to see this UI unified across Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud.

We’ll probably hear more about Xbox PC plans and further hints at the direction of Xbox consoles at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) next month. Microsoft has used GDC in the past to detail key developer changes to Xbox, as well as next-gen Xbox development plans. While I’m not expecting to hear full details about the next Xbox, I’d expect the various sessions will shed further light on the plans to merge Xbox and Windows, as well as more of Microsoft’s AI work in gaming.

We won’t be seeing a next-gen Xbox release this year, though. AMD CEO Lisa Su hinted this week that Microsoft could launch its next-gen Xbox in 2027. “Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox, featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC, is progressing well to support a launch in 2027,” said Su in an earnings call on Tuesday. Microsoft has only vaguely teased its next-gen Xbox plans so far, and I’m hoping that a bigger teaser is set for later this year.

Xbox fans will get a new controller this year, though. I’m hearing that Microsoft has greenlit next-gen Xbox controllers that include Wi-Fi connectivity to reduce Xbox Cloud Gaming latency. A new Xbox controller was originally planned for 2024, alongside a canceled Xbox Series X refresh. Windows Central also expects an Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 debut in 2026, which would align with a rollout of next-gen Xbox controllers.

New Xbox controllers that connect directly to Xbox Cloud Gaming could help boost Microsoft’s Game Pass numbers and complement plans for free ad-supported access to cloud games. I understand Microsoft is getting close to testing free Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming with Xbox Insiders, ahead of a broader rollout this year.

While the free Xbox Cloud Gaming won’t be a new Game Pass tier, sources tell me Microsoft is in the early stages of exploring ways to expand its Game Pass subscription lineup. After a Game Pass Ultimate price hike in October, I understand that Microsoft is looking at ways to bundle third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions and potentially even merge Xbox Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass together. I wouldn’t expect to see any major changes to Game Pass this year, though.

Microsoft already added PC games to its various Xbox Game Pass subscriptions in October, with the dedicated PC Game Pass subscription rising by nearly 40 percent to cover the cost of day one releases. Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions, but it needs to clear up its fragmented subscription options if the future of Xbox consoles is PC.

All of the Xbox platform changes and pressure on big game releases add up to an important year for Xbox as it marks its 25-year anniversary. I’m certainly hoping that by the end of the year we’ll have a much better idea of Microsoft’s vision for the next 25 years of Xbox.

I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01. I’m also tomwarren on Telegram, if you’d prefer to chat there.

Correction, February 5th: Removed mention of special edition consoles as they’re unlikely to launch this year.

            <div id="article-text">﻿By trying to drive more assertively, Waymo appears to be adopting some dangerous human habits.

﻿By trying to drive more assertively, Waymo appears to be adopting some dangerous human habits.

For years, Alphabet-owned Waymo has tried to set itself apart from other self-driving startups by emphasizing a culture of caution and safety. Now, just ahead of major planned rollouts across the country, it is facing a recurring failure in one of the most sensitive places imaginable: school zones.

In December, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into Waymo after Austin’s largest school district reported at least 19 incidents where the company’s robotaxis failed to fully stop for school buses during loading and unloading — an illegal violation in all 50 states. Waymo quickly responded by issuing a voluntary software recall and rolling out updates intended to fix the problem.

But the patch didn’t work. Since the update, Austin Independent School District (ISD) says at least four additional violations have occurred, including one as recently as January 19th, when a Waymo vehicle was filmed breezing through the opposite lane of traffic as children waited to cross the street and board a bus with its stop arm extended. In total, at least 24 safety violations involving Waymo vehicles and school buses have been reported in Austin since the start of the 2025 school year.

Waymo has defended itself, in part, by noting that none of the Austin school bus incidents resulted in a collision or injury. But that’s no longer strictly the case nationwide. Last week, Waymo published a blog post acknowledging that one of its vehicles struck a child outside a Santa Monica elementary school on January 23rd. Although the school district told The Washington Post that the child sustained only minor injuries, the outcome could have been far worse: Waymo says the vehicle slowed from 17 mph to 6 mph in the instant before impact.

Experts specializing in autonomous vehicle safety and pedestrian interaction told The Verge that these incidents were concerning, particularly given the company’s stated goal of making its vehicles drive more “confidently assertive.” In an effort to shed the stereotype of driving like a cautious grandparent, the vehicles have been spotted playing looser with traffic rules. But making robotaxis seem more humanlike also risks having them inadvertently inherit some of our more dangerous driving habits.

“These technologies are still being developed and tested in a real world environment because there’s a lot of things that happen in the real world that’s hard for companies and engineers to anticipate,” Cornell Tech professor and and expert in human-robot interaction Wendy Ju tells The Verge. “Unless you have some understanding of all the things that might happen, it’s hard to know what to design around.”

Waymo did not respond to repeated requests for comment. On Wednesday, Waymo’s chief safety officer Mauricio Peña responded to safety concerns raised during a Senate hearing. He said Waymo is evaluating each of the school bus incidents and is developing fixes, some of which have already been incorporated into its software. Peña also said they are working with Austin ISD to “collect data on different lighting patterns and different conditions.” Waymo notably didn’t commit to stop operating around school buses while that data collection and testing occurs.

Navigating around school buses is one of the more dangerous aspects of driving, for both humans and robots alike. NHTSA attributed 61 fatalities to vehicles illegally passing school buses between 2000 and 2023, almost half of whom were pedestrians under the age of 18. That danger has less to do with the bus drivers themselves, who are typically licensed and careful, and more to do with the chaotic, improvisational nature of the situation. Buses are often double-packed, and kids, being kids, might not wait to cross the street when they are supposed to.

“Waymos are having an issue because every driver has issues around school buses,” Ju said

As a result, drivers navigating around buses need to rely on experience and intuition in addition to following the firm set of rules they learned in driver’s ed. That kind of common-sense logic, which comes naturally to skilled human drivers, Wu says, is particularly challenging for self-driving cars.

“There’s all these moments in time where you actually have to make a judgment call between different things that you’re supposed to do,” Ju said.

On a technical level, there may be more at play. According to George Mason University professor and director of the Mason Autonomy and Robotics Center Missy Cummings, the apparent spike in robotaxi safety issues involving school buses may be linked to what she describes as Waymo’s increasing shift away from traditional, modular machine-learning toward a greater emphasis on end-to-end learning, a technology she calls “faddish” and “still nascent.”

Waymo, publicly, says it uses a mixture of the two, but some speculate that that balance is shifting.

Earlier autonomous-vehicle systems relied on more conservative, layered architectures, with separate modules responsible for detecting objects, classifying them, and applying explicit safety rules governing how a vehicle should respond. End-to-end learning, by contrast, collapses much of that process into a single model that takes in all of the information gathered by a car’s sensors at once and produces driving decisions probabilistically, based on patterns learned from large swaths of human driving behavior. The result is something that can seem more “natural” and humanlike, though Cummings argues it can also introduce additional risk, especially in high-stakes scenarios like school bus stops.

The safety incidents demonstrate “all the hallmarks of problems when you change architecture,” Cummings said. “I suspect many [robotaxi companies] are doing it.”

Regardless of what is causing the mistakes, Austin ISD has made its position clear. Officials reportedly asked Waymo to cease robotaxi operations around schools during loading and unloading hours until the issue is resolved. But Waymo refused and has continued operating, a decision experts say seems both shortsighted and at odds with the company’s public image of promoting safety and caution.

“I think it’s concerning that Waymo wouldn’t agree to that,” Cummings said. “You’re only talking about truly an hour and a half, 45 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon, so it’s not a heavy lift to not do that.”

Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon Professor and AV safety expert, echoed that sentiment  in a recent edition of his Substack newsletter Autonomous System Safety.

“Waymo is making an explicit choice to gamble with children’s lives,” Koopman writes. “They say they like the odds, but it is not their gamble to make.”

And while the vast majority of issues involving school buses occur in Austin, that’s likely partly due to the city recently outfitting each of their stop arms with cameras. In other words, similar incidents could be happening elsewhere but are simply going unnoticed. Austin ISD did not respond to our requests for comment. (Axios reported that the problem is happening in Atlanta as well.)

The school bus incidents, along with the striking of the child in California, have sparked three federal investigations in as many months. Though unlikely in Texas’ loose AV regulatory environment, incidents like these could put Waymo at risk of having its operating license revoked. Even now, as investigators reportedly head to Austin in person to probe the company, robotaxis continue to operate in the school zone. At the very least, that cavalier approach could make other municipalities think twice before welcoming the company’s cars to their streets.

“Waymo brought this on themselves,” Cummings said. “If they had done the responsible thing and self elected to stay out of school zones until they fixed it, then they wouldn’t have this big [public] investigation because the big investigation is made public.”

﻿With a limited supply of RAM available, Nvidia is reportedly prioritizing AI over gaming.

The Super refresh to Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs was expected at CES 2026 in January, but it didn’t make an appearance. The Information reports that in December, Nvidia managers decided not to release the new cards as scheduled, choosing to prioritize AI chips instead due to the limited supply of RAM currently available. On top of that, “Nvidia is also slashing production of its current line of gaming chips,” the RTX 50-series, which are already in high demand and consistently sold out at retailers.

The priority shift away from gaming GPUs follows record-breaking revenue for Nvidia, driven by its AI chips. Data center revenue made up $51.2 billion out of the total $57 billion Nvidia reported in its Q3 2026 earnings. While gaming revenue was also up 30 percent during that same period, it makes up a much smaller slice of the pie than it used to.

The RTX 50-series Super delay not only means there’s currently no new gaming GPU launch from Nvidia scheduled for this year, but it could push back next-generation cards, too. According to The Information’s source, the RTX 60-series was “originally scheduled to begin mass production at the end of 2027,” and pushing that back could send it into 2028 or even later.

As The Information points out, it’s not impossible that Nvidia could move the timeline for its new gaming GPUs back up. But as the RAM shortage continues, driving up prices and pushing back release dates for everything from iPhones to the Steam Machine, planned hardware upgrades for PC gamers may have to wait.

Horizon Hunters Gathering lets you play with two friends on PS5 or PC.

Sony is expanding its Horizon universe again with Horizon Hunters Gathering, a “cooperative action game” in development by franchise creator Guerrilla for PS5 and PC.

Horizon Hunters Gathering lets “up to three players team up as heroic Hunters to protect a world under threat from deadly machines,” according to a blog post. “Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play.”

You’ll be able to select a character from a roster of “Hunters” with different play styles, and you can customize them with different roles and roguelike-style perks and upgrades. There will be a narrative campaign, and each of the Hunters “have their own motivations and personal struggles.”

The “foundation” of Horizon Hunters Gathering is focused on “challenging and replayable hunts.” The development team is initially showing off two game modes: “Machine Incursion, a high-intensity mission where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a formidable boss; and Cauldron Descent, a longer, multi-stage trial in which ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them.”

If you don’t want to play with other people, single-player is an option; instead, you’ll have two NPCs on your team, Sony says.

Sony hasn’t shared a specific release window for the game, but there will be a “small-scale closed playtest” coming at the end of February. You can sign up to potentially get access to it through the PlayStation Beta Program. Horizon Hunters Gathering will also support crossplay and cross-progression.

Although Sony has scaled back its live service ambitions, Horizon Hunters Gathering marks just the latest ongoing title from the company. It’s also developing an MMO in the Horizon universe called Horizon Steel Frontiers and is set to launch Marathon in March after a delay.

Guerrilla also wants you to know that it isn’t pivoting fully into multiplayer games. “We absolutely love making single-player games and we’re going to keep making them,” studio director Jan-Bart van Beek says in a video. “They’re a huge part of who we are as a studio.”

            <div id="article-text">﻿It’s the end of an era: Hulu ends support for its Nintendo Switch app, while Netflix says goodbye to the PlayStation 3.

﻿It’s the end of an era: Hulu ends support for its Nintendo Switch app, while Netflix says goodbye to the PlayStation 3.

This is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

It’s been a rough couple of days for gamers who also love to binge their favorite TV shows with their consoles: At the beginning of the week, Netflix began informing PlayStation 3 owners with an onscreen message that it would discontinue support for its PS3 app after March 2nd. And today, Hulu is pulling the plug on its app for Nintendo’s original Switch.

Netflix’s decision to discontinue its PS3 app, which was first spotted by multiple Reddit users, is particularly noteworthy: The console used to be at the forefront of Netflix’s living room tech efforts, only to eventually be outflanked by the growing popularity of more modern and capable smart TVs and streaming devices.

Netflix first launched an app for Sony’s PlayStation 3 in late 2009, with a twist: Instead of shipping a downloadable app for the device, the company initially distributed discs with its app to its members.

Netflix eventually began distributing its app through the PlayStation Store, and quickly became a hit. By 2012, the PS3 was the most popular streaming device among its customer base. “PS3 is our largest TV-connected platform in terms of Netflix viewing, and this year, at times, even surpassed the PC in hours of Netflix enjoyment to become our number one platform overall,” said then-CEO Reed Hastings at the time.

But the game console wasn’t just a boon for Netflix’s streaming hours. It also quickly became a key part of Netflix’s app development strategy. On other platforms, Netflix had to ship a new app version every time it changed anything about the app’s features or design. The PlayStation app, on the other hand, was based on HTML5, which allowed Netflix to swap out individual components and test features and design choices with subsets of its audience on the fly. This quickly turned the PS3 into a cornerstone of Netflix’s A/B-testing strategy.

“PS3 is a natural fit for Netflix in terms of developing and first deploying our most advanced features,” Hastings said in 2012. “We can transparently update our application with new features on a daily basis.”

As a result, PS3 owners also got to see many Netflix features before those features arrived on Roku and other streamers. This included casting support, which Netflix debuted on the PS3 close to a year before Google launched its own Chromecast streaming adapter.

Netflix isn’t the only streaming venture that owes a debt to game consoles: In 2002, enthusiasts built the Xbox Media Player to watch videos they had downloaded from the internet or ripped from DVDs on Microsoft’s original Xbox. The project soon became known as XBMC, or the Xbox Media Center, and has since morphed into Kodi, a cross-platform media player. XBMC also laid the foundation for Plex, which has since outgrown its media center roots to also become a streaming service for ad-supported content.

However, as streaming matured and smart TVs became more popular, the share of consumers streaming media with their consoles has been declining. In early 2018, 21 percent of US households used a game console as their primary streaming device, according to Parks Associates data. By the end of 2025, that number had declined to just 7 percent. The number of households streaming with their smart TVs increased from 39 percent to 61 percent during the same time, while streaming dongle usage essentially remained flat.

With that, there’s a lot less need for streaming services to be available on these devices. Plus, as streaming services evolve to add new features, it often simply doesn’t make sense for them to keep supporting older and less capable hardware. Netflix, for instance, has been adding cloud-streamed games and interactive livestreams to its catalog, and discontinued some legacy device support in the process. Just last month, the company disabled support for casting across most devices.

Last fall, new Peloton CEO Peter Stern made a bet. The company announced a complete refresh of its entire hardware lineup, complete with swivel screens and AI-powered features. Today, the initial results of Stern’s bet are in. In its Q2 2026 earnings call, Stern noted that the hardware refresh hasn’t landed with existing Peloton users, resulting in weaker-than-expected holiday sales during what’s usually Peloton’s strongest quarter. As a result, Peloton stocks fell roughly 20 percent this morning.

Peloton also announced that chief financial officer Liz Coddington would be leaving at the end of March. Last week, the company announced yet another round of layoffs, cutting 11 percent of its staff from its engineering and enterprise efforts.

The Cross Training series launched in October and included a new Bike, Bike Plus, Tread, Tread Plus, and Row Plus that added swivel screens, cameras for AI-powered strength training feedback, fans, and cushier seats. The new Peloton IQ features also included real-time form correction, analysis, and AI-generated workout routines. However, Peloton also raised prices of the new hardware with the Tread Plus reaching a whopping $6,695. The company also hiked up subscription prices.

“Our installed base of equipment is quite durable and member satisfaction is extremely high,” Stern said on the call. “We believe these factors contribute to a longer upgrade cycle than we had anticipated.”

Stern went on to note that sales to new Peloton users met expectations. He also stressed that existing Peloton users did buy new categories of hardware from the Cross Training series (e.g., Bike owners buying a treadmill or rower). He also noted that the company views Peloton IQ as a success, saying 46 percent of users have engaged with the features since rollout.

Although Peloton users are loyal, many were displeased with the Cross Training series rollout. Several reached out to The Verge to say they were disappointed the company offered no trade-in program to upgrade their existing equipment. That was further exacerbated when users found instructions for swapping out old screens in the self-install kit for the Cross Training series and some users felt this was the company squeezing them for more money.

It wasn’t all bad news, however. Despite the increase in subscription price and some initial cancellations, Peloton said that churn was lower than expected for the period. That said, total revenue fell 3 percent year over year at $657 million, with both hardware and subscription sales falling short of expected targets.

Even so, Stern spent the earnings call determined to paint Peloton’s improvements in operational costs and prioritizing future profitability. In that vein, Stern emphasized that Peloton isn’t a fitness company anymore but a wellness one. That means doubling down on partnerships with lifestyle brands like Respin, focusing on menopause-related wellness content, as well as expanding strength training efforts. Regarding the latter, Stern identified heightened demand for strength training as dovetailing with increased adoption of GLP-1 medications, which are known to cause muscle loss.

“Fitness and wellness isn’t a quarterly goal for our members, and it shouldn’t be for our business either,” Stern said. He ended the call urging analysts and investors to try Pilates and kettlebell classes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.
