            <h2>NASA orders “controlled medical evacuation” from the International Space Station</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/in-a-first-nasa-orders-astronauts-home-after-unspecified-medical-issue/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA officials said Thursday they have decided to bring home four of the seven crew members on the International Space Station after one of them experienced a “medical situation” earlier this week.

The space agency has said little about the incident, and officials have not identified which crew member suffered the medical issue. James “JD” Polk, NASA’s chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is “absolutely stable” but that the agency is “erring on the side of caution” with the decision to bring to return the astronaut to Earth.

The ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Thursday.

The Crew-11 mission is led by commander Zena Cardman, 38, who is wrapping up her first mission to space. Second in command is pilot Mike Fincke, a 58-year-old astronaut on his fourth spaceflight. Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, 55, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, 39, round out the crew.

Isaacman said NASA will release more information about the schedule for Crew-11’s undocking and reentry within the next 48 hours. The crew will home home aboard the same SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft they launched in more than five months ago. The entire crew must return to Earth together because they rely on the same Dragon spacecraft as a lifeboat.

“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”

Polk, a physician who has served as NASA’s chief medical officer since 2016, said the agency is not ready to release details about the medical issue, citing privacy concerns. “I’m not going to speak about any particular astronaut or any particular specific diagnosis,” Polk said. “I’d ask that we still respect the privacy of the astronaut.”

Two of the Crew-11 astronauts, Cardman and Fincke, were preparing to head outside the space station on a spacewalk early Thursday. Spacewalk preps at the space station include a period of time breathing high concentrations of oxygen to purge nitrogen from the astronauts’ bloodstreams, a mitigation to avoid decompression sickness when crew members are sealed inside their spacesuits’ pure oxygen atmosphere.

Polk said whatever happened Wednesday “had nothing to do” with preparing for the spacewalk. “This was totally unrelated to any operations onboard,” he said. “It’s mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity with the suite of hardware that we have at our avail to complete a diagnosis.”

Yui radioed mission controllers in Houston on Wednesday afternoon requesting a private medical conference with a flight surgeon, then asked ground teams to turn on camera views inside the station ahead of the session. Medical sessions are carried out on private radio channels, and are not heard on the regular communication loops between the space station and mission control. Those open loops are streamed around the clock online, but NASA removed the audio feed from YouTube soon after the crew asked for the medical conference.

NASA publicly revealed a medical concern with one of the astronauts later Wednesday afternoon, then announced late Wednesday night that officials were considering bringing the crew home early.

“I won’t go into specific details about the medical incident itself,” Polk said. “But the crew is highly trained, and they came to the aid of their colleague right away, and that’s part of why we do that training.”

The space station is stocked with medical gear and medications to help astronauts respond to emergencies. Crew members are trained to perform ultrasounds, defibrillate patients, and start IVs, among other things. The medical treatment available on the ISS is akin to what an EMT might provide in transit to a hospital, former astronaut Tom Marshburn, himself a medical doctor, said in 2021.

“We have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don’t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete the workup of a patient,” Polk said.

Space station managers will take a few days to determine when the Dragon spacecraft will leave the station. SpaceX will dispatch a recovery ship from Southern California to sail for the splashdown zone in the Pacific, and officials will assess weather and sea conditions before selecting the best opportunity to depart the station. Like every crew return, the vessel will be staffed with medical personnel to examine the astronauts after exiting from the Dragon capsule.

“Because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergent evacuation,” Polk said. “We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down.”

But without a confirmed diagnosis of the astronaut’s medical issue, there’s some “lingering risk” for the astronaut’s health if they remained in orbit, Polk said. That’s why Isaacman and his deputies agreed to call an early end to the Crew-11 mission.

This was the most significant decision of Isaacman’s young tenure as NASA administrator. He was sworn in as NASA chief last month after clearing a confirmation vote in the Senate. Before taking the helm at NASA, Isaacman charted a career as an entrepreneur and private astronaut, flying to space twice on commercial missions with SpaceX.

After Crew-11’s departure, the space station will operate with a smaller crew of three until the arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-12 mission with a fresh team of astronauts next month. Isaacman said NASA and SpaceX are looking at options to move up the launch of Crew-12 from its current target date of February 15.

Until then, the station’s crew will consist of NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts, who launched to the space station in November on a Russian Soyuz vehicle. Williams and his crewmates—Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev—have their own lifeboat in the Soyuz spacecraft, so they will still have a ride home in the event of a future emergency.

The space station regularly operated with just three crew members for the first decade of its existence. The complex has been permanently staffed since 2000, sometimes with as few as two astronauts or cosmonauts. The standard crew size was raised to six in 2009, then to seven in 2020.

Williams will be solely responsible for overseeing the lab’s US segment until Crew-12 arrives. He will be busy keeping up with maintenance tasks, so managers will likely defer some of the station’s scientific investigations until the complex is back to a full crew.

The early departure of Crew-11, leaving Williams as the only US astronaut aboard, also means NASA will be unable to perform spacewalks. This will mean a “slightly elevated risk” in NASA’s ability to respond to a major hardware failure that might require a spacewalk to fix, said Amit Kshatriya, the agency’s associate administrator.

NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, inked an agreement in 2022 to fly multinational crews on Dragon and Soyuz missions to ensure an American and a Russian are always at the space station. The so-called “seat swap” deal is proving worthwhile with this week’s events.

NASA has never before cut short a human spaceflight mission for medical reasons. “It’s the first time we’ve done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,” Kshatriya said.

The Soviet Union called an early end for an expedition to the Salyut 7 space station in 1985 after the mission’s commander fell ill in orbit.

In a sense, it is surprising that it took this long. Polk said predictive models suggested the ISS would have a medical evacuation about once every three years. It ended up taking 25 years. In that time, NASA has improved astronauts’ abilities to treat aches and pains, minor injuries, and routine illnesses.

Crews in orbit can now self-treat ailments that might have prompted a crew to return to Earth in the past. One astronaut was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, or a blood clot, in 2018 without requiring an early departure from the space station. Another astronaut suffered a pinched nerve in 2021 and remained in orbit for another seven months.

One of the more compelling reasons for the space station’s existence is its ability to act as a testbed for learning how to live and work off the planet. The station has served as a laboratory for studying how spaceflight affects the human body, and as a platform to test life support systems necessary for long-duration voyages to deep space.

“We are doing all this to continue to learn,” Isaacman said. “We will absolutely learn from this situation as well, to see if that informs our future on-orbit operations, whether that be on the space station or our future lunar base that we’re pursuing right now, and eventually for deep space missions to Mars.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/michigan-man-learns-the-hard-way-that-catch-a-cheater-spyware-apps-arent-legal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2002, Bryan Fleming helped to create pcTattletale, software for monitoring phone and computer usage. Fleming’s tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber.

This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employee monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale’s website, where the software was said to have “helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.” Businesses can “track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.” Even “police departments use it for investigating.”

But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it.

It’s unclear when pcTattletale began marketing itself as a tool for catching cheaters, but Fleming’s original business partner left the company in 2011, and Fleming ran things himself from his home in a northern Detroit suburb.

In 2021, Vice reported that pcTattletale was leaking the sensitive data it collected. The story quoted marketing materials about using the tool to catch a “cheating spouse,” which required users to know their spouse’s “pass-code and have access to the phone for about 5 minutes. The best time to do this is when they are sleeping.” The company also provided instructions to hide icons that might reveal that pcTattletale was running on the victim’s phone.

A look through archived versions of the pcTattletale site on the Wayback Machine shows that by 2022, pcTattletale had added numerous “cheating” links to its footers and featured multiple blog posts on ways to “catch your boyfriend cheating.” These explicitly directed people to use the “unlock code to your boyfriend’s phone” to install “the pcTattletale spy app” in order to “watch everything he does on his phone.” One entry even noted that people being spied on in this way are unlikely to be happy about it, and users should “expect him to lash back at you over putting the spy app on his phone. It can really turn the tables.”

Around this same time, federal investigators in California had launched an investigation into “stalkerware,” and pcTattletale was among their targets. It also looked like a site where an arrest might not be too difficult, since Fleming operated out of the US and made no real attempts to hide his location. (Indeed, older versions of the pcTattletale website said explicitly that “Fleming Technologies” was based in Bruce Township, Michigan.) As a government investigator put it, “many of the other [stalkerware] websites under investigation involve targets who are believed to be overseas. For this reason, it is unrealistic to believe that the targets will soon be apprehended.”

But Fleming was easy enough to find, and investigators soon obtained copies of his email account. It contained plenty of support requests in this vein: “Also if there is a way to NOT let user know you are taking screen shot that would be helpful too. My husband knows when there is screen shot being taken as it beeps. He is now suspicious of something being on his phone.”

Despite being repeatedly told that people were using his product to spy on others without their consent, Fleming helped them with tech support.

A government investigator even opened up an affiliate marketing account for pcTattletale, and Fleming reached out to offer ready-made banner ads with text like “pcTattletale Cheating Husband? #1 catch a cheater spy tracker” and “pcTattletale Husband Cheating? Best Catch a Cheater Spy App.”

Fleming noted in an email that pcTattletale was more successful when marketed at women, because “There are a lot more women wanting to catch their man then [sic] the other way around.” Financial records showed that Fleming was selling around 1,200 pcTattletale subscriptions a year at anywhere from $99 to $300.

Based on all this, the government obtained a search warrant in late 2022 and raided the Bruce Township home where Fleming lived.

In 2024, TechCrunch reported that pcTattletale was hacked and much of its data was leaked. Apparently, hackers had gained access to the company’s private keys for the Amazon Web Services account where most of the video data created by the app was stored. Fleming claimed at the time that his company was “out of business and completely done” after the breach.

The feds eventually charged Fleming with selling a product while “knowing or having reason to know” that the software was “primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.” This week in California, Fleming pled guilty to a single count and was released on his own recognizance while awaiting sentencing.

One piece of stalkerware is off the market; unfortunately, many others remain, and their owners and operators are often harder to find.</div>

            <h2>Wi-Fi advocates get win from FCC with vote to allow higher-power devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-to-authorize-more-powerful-wireless-devices-in-6-ghz-wi-fi-band/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission plans to authorize a new category of wireless devices in the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band that will be permitted to operate at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.

The FCC said it scheduled a vote for its January 29 meeting on an order “to create a new category of unlicensed devices… that can operate outdoors and at higher power than previously authorized devices.” These so-called Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices operating on the 6 GHz band will “support high data rates suitable for AR/VR, short-range hotspots, automation, and indoor navigation,” and “overcome limitations of previous device classes by allowing higher power and outdoor mobility,” the FCC said. They will be required to work with geofencing systems to avoid interference with fixed microwave links and radio astronomy observatories.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr attributed the FCC’s planned action to President Trump in a press release titled, “President Trump Unleashes American Innovation With 6 GHz Win.” That’s consistent with Carr’s relatively new stance that the FCC takes orders from the president, despite his insisting during the Biden era that the FCC must operate independently from the White House.

While many of Carr’s regulatory decisions have been criticized by consumer advocates, the 6 GHz action is an exception. Michael Calabrese, of New America’s Open Technology Institute, told Ars that “increasing the power levels for Wi-Fi connections to peripheral devices such as AR/VR is a big win for consumers” and a change that has been “long advocated by the Wi-Fi community.”

Carr said that the FCC “will vote on an order that expands unlicensed operations in the 6 GHz band so that consumers can benefit from better, faster Wi-Fi and an entirely new generation of wireless devices—from AR/VR and IoT to a range of innovative smart devices. [It] will do so through a set of forward-looking regulations that allow devices to operate at higher power while protecting incumbent users, including through geofencing systems.”

The FCC press release described the new class of devices as follows:

Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices promise to overcome technical and regulatory constraints of other low power devices such as low power indoor (LPI) and very low power (VLP) devices. GVP devices offer data rates suitable for reality/virtual reality, short-range hotspots, automation processes, and indoor location and navigation because they operate at significantly higher power than VLP devices. At the same time, GVP devices need not be restricted indoors, as is the case with LPI. These benefits will be made possible by restricting GVP devices from operating in exclusion zones on certain frequencies to protect incumbent licensed services from any significant risk of harmful interference.

GVP device power limits will be “up to 11 dBm/MHz PSD and 24 dBm EIRP,” the FCC said. The FCC will also evaluate ideas to boost the power of low-power indoor devices sometime in the future. The FCC said it “will seek comment on proposals that could provide more utility for unlicensed devices in the 6 GHz band,” including “a proposal to allow composite standard-power and LPI access points to operate with additional power under certain circumstances.”

A draft of the order said the planned “additional power will enable composite standard-power/LPI access points to increase indoor coverage and provide more versatility to American consumers.” The FCC will also seek comment on a proposal to authorize LPI access points on cruise ships.

Calabrese said that increasing power for indoor-only devices would be a big deal because “it’s long been recognized that the indoor-only power limits are overly restrictive.” The Open Technology Institute and over a dozen other advocacy groups urged the FCC to make this change in an August 2023 letter to then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.

“We’ve pushed hard for that and were very disappointed that the Rosenworcel FCC failed to get it done,” Calabrese said.

Harold Feld of Public Knowledge, another group that signed the August 2023 letter, welcomed the FCC plan and said more actions are needed to promote use of unlicensed spectrum. While much of the public spectrum is licensed for the exclusive use of individual wireless carriers, Wi-Fi and similar services operate on unlicensed spectrum that is shared by many users.

“This is important for Wi-Fi 7 as well as Wi-Fi 6,” Feld wrote today in response to the Carr plan. “But we need a real pipeline for more unlicensed spectrum. Glad to see value of unlicensed acknowledged. Looking forward to more of it.”

Despite the positive response to Carr’s plan this week, there’s still a potential threat to Wi-Fi’s use of the 6 GHz band. The 1,200 MHz between 5.925 and 7.125 GHz was allocated to Wi-Fi in April 2020, but a plan to auction spectrum to wireless carriers could take some of those frequencies away from Wi-Fi.

A law approved by Congress and Trump in July 2025 requires the FCC to auction at least 800 MHz of spectrum, some of which could come from the 6 GHz band currently allocated to Wi-Fi or the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in the 3550 MHz to 3700 MHz range. The FCC has some leeway to decide which frequencies to auction, and its pending decision in the matter will draw much interest from groups interested in preserving and expanding Wi-Fi and CBRS access.

Calabrese said in June 2025 that 6 GHz and CBRS “are the most vulnerable non-federal bands for reallocation and auction.” But now, after Trump administration statements claiming 6 GHz Wi-Fi as a key Trump accomplishment and support from congressional Republicans, Calabrese told Ars today that reallocation of Wi-Fi frequencies “seems far less likely.” Advocates are “far more worried about CBRS now than 6 GHz,” he said.

In addition to consumer advocacy groups, the cable industry has been lobbying for Wi-Fi and CBRS, putting it in opposition to the mobile industry that seeks more exclusive licenses to use airwaves. Cable industry lobby group NCTA said yesterday that it is “encouraged by the FCC’s action to enhance usage in the 6 GHz band. With Wi-Fi now carrying nearly 90 percent of mobile data, securing more unlicensed spectrum is essential to keep up with surging consumer demand, power emerging technologies, and ensure fast, reliable connections for homes, businesses, and communities nationwide.”</div>

            <h2>High RAM prices mean record-setting profits for Samsung and other memory makers</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/high-ram-prices-mean-record-setting-profits-for-samsung-and-other-memory-makers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Supply shortages and big price increases for RAM and storage have been a major drag for enthusiasts and PC builders in recent months. And while we haven’t yet seen large, widespread price increases for memory-dependent products like pre-built laptop PCs, smartphones, and graphics cards, most companies expect that to change this year if shortages continue.

In the meantime, memory manufacturers are riding high demand and high prices to record profits.

In revenue guidance released this week, Samsung Electronics predicts it will make between 19.9 and 20.1 trillion Korean won in operating profit (roughly $13.8 billion USD) in Q4 2025, compared to just 6.49 trillion won in Q4 of 2024.

Samsung is way more than just a memory business, of course, but its fortunes often rise and fall along with its memory division; Samsung’s profits were dropping dramatically in 2023 partly because of an oversupply of memory that made its memory division lose billions of dollars.

Less-diversified companies that primarily make memory are also raking in money lately. SK Hynix posted its “highest-ever quarterly performance” in Q3 of 2025 with 11.38 trillion Korean won (about $7.8 billion) in operating profit, up from 7.03 trillion in Q3 of 2024, and an operating margin that increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. SK Hynix credits “expanding investments in AI infrastructure” and “surging demand for AI servers” for its performance.

Micron—which recently decided to exit the consumer RAM and storage markets but is still selling its products to other businesses—also reported a big boost to net income year over year, from $1.87 billion in Q1 2025 to $5.24 billion in Q1 2026. This has generated the company’s “highest ever free cash flow.”

“Total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, as well as HBM and data center revenue and revenue in each of our business units, also reached new records [in fiscal Q1],” wrote Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.

Reading these upbeat earnings reports and forecasts will be cold comfort to people trying to build or upgrade a PC, who have seen the price of a 32GB kit of DDR5-6000 increase from $80 in August 2025 to $340 today. And if the current AI boom continues, it’s unlikely to improve in the near term.

This is a problem with many causes—including scalpers who are capitalizing on the shortages by buying up kits to resell them—but the two biggest ones can be attributed to generative AI companies, and each problem compounds the other.

The first is just that consumers and PC manufacturers get to compete with OpenAI and its ilk for the standard DRAM used for traditional servers and consumer devices. By some estimates, OpenAI’s “Stargate” could use as much as 40 percent of the world’s DRAM output all by itself (though that figure uses production numbers as of 2024 and 2025 and doesn’t take production increases into account).

The second is that the HBM (high-bandwidth memory) used for Nvidia’s AI data center GPUs uses about three times as much space on a silicon wafer as the same amount of standard DDR5. So when memory manufacturers shift their production capacity to HBM instead of DRAM, it disproportionately reduces the amount of DRAM that they can make.

Either of these problems would drive up the prices of RAM a bit, but dealing with increased demand and reduced supply at the same time is what has kicked memory prices into the stratosphere.

As things currently stand, the AI industry’s gargantuan demand for these chips will keep memory prices elevated, possibly for years. According to Bank of America analysts cited by SK Hynix, the average selling price for DRAM will increase by as much as 33 percent in 2026, and the market for just HBM in 2028 could be larger than the entire RAM market was in 2024. Micron’s CEO expects both increased demand and constrained supply “to persist beyond calendar 2026,” suggesting that we could be waiting years for the current crunch to end.

Of course, all of these companies’ forecasts rely on the continued demand for RAM in AI data centers. If there’s an AI bubble and it bursts or deflates, memory manufacturers could find themselves back where Samsung was in 2023—sitting on such big piles of unsold chips that they have to reduce prices to move all the inventory.</div>

            <h2>RFK Jr.’s dietary guidance: Food funnel features slab of red meat, butter</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-s-dietary-guidelines-beef-tallow-is-in-but-no-booze-for-breakfast/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins unveiled the delayed 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for America Wednesday, which is already drawing criticism for its ties to the meat and dairy industry.

Headlining with the advice to “eat real food,” the new guidelines, which are updated every five years, are in a brisk, citation-free 10-page document. Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn’t clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink “less”; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.

“We are ending the war on saturated fats,” Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change. He went on to proclaim that “today, our government declares war on added sugar,” though that too is questionable.

While the new guidelines say “no amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended,” it offers the suggestion that “one meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars.” There are four calories in one gram of sugar, so the recommendation means no more than 40 calories from sugar per meal. For three meals a day, that’s a max of 120 calories from sugar a day, which on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, would be about 6 percent of total calories. The previous recommendation in the 2020–2025 guidelines was to have less than 10 percent of total calories per day from added sugars.

Earning some praise from outside experts, including the American Medical Association, the new guidelines are the first iteration to directly address highly processed foods. While emphasizing “whole, nutrient-dense foods,” it aims for a “dramatic reduction in highly processed foods laden with refined carbohydrates, added sugars, excess sodium, unhealthy fats, and chemical additives.”

While the guidelines don’t provide a clear definition of what constitutes highly processed foods or how consumers can identify them, they do offer some broad examples at various points, including store-bought “chips, cookies, and candy,” and “white bread, ready-to-eat or packaged breakfast options, flour tortillas, and crackers.”

In an effort to steer Americans to healthy choices, the new guidance unveils a new(ish) visual aid—a food pyramid that is upside-down, thus resembling a funnel.

The move at least explains a puzzling trend: Over the past year, Kennedy and other Trump administration officials have repeatedly made reference to the food pyramid—though only to mock and scorn it, often with inaccuracies.

“The dietary guidelines that we inherited from the Biden administration were 453 pages long,” Kennedy said in August, referring to the 2020–2025 guidelines, which are 164 pages long. “They were driven by the same commercial impulses that put Froot Loops at the top of the food pyramid.”

On Wednesday’s unveiling of the new guidelines, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary lamented that, “for decades, we’ve been fed a corrupt food pyramid.”

Not only were Froot Loops never listed on a food pyramid, no food pyramid has been included in federal dietary guidelines for over a decade, raising the question of why the administration was repeatedly attacking a defunct polyhedron. The original food pyramid was introduced in 1992, significantly revised in 2005, and ditched entirely in 2011. Since then, the guidelines have used MyPlate as a visual aid, intended to provide a simplistic depiction of the foods people should eat, in their recommended proportions, on a plate.

The resurrection of a pyramid in its upside-down form clarifies the administration’s geometric obsession. In the new funnel version, though, the food groups are a jumbled spectrum, rather than stacked or divided, leaving proportions up to guesswork. The wide top of the funnel includes a large slab of red meat, a wedge of cheese, a whole roasted bird, broccoli, carrots, and a bag of frozen peas. As it tapers downward, it includes whole milk and unsweetened yogurt, “healthy fats” including olive oil and a stick of butter, as well as fruits and nuts, and then ends with whole grains.

(The written guidance identifies “healthy fats” as olive oil, but also “butter or beef tallow.” Beef tallow is a fat Kennedy has personally endorsed, but is probably harder to easily depict in a drawing.)

The visual guidance seems to create some conflict with the guidelines’ written recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10 percent of total calories, given that red meat and whole-fat dairy contain high amounts of saturated fat.

In a response, the American Heart Association said it was “concerned” about the guidelines, noting that saturated fats, along with salt, are the “primary drivers of cardiovascular disease.” The guidance also suggests that people can eat more than the recommended 2,300 mg limit of sodium a day if they work out to, they said, “offset sweat losses” (no citation included).

Pending scientific evidence suggesting otherwise, the AHA’s stance is for people to reduce sugar and sodium and to “prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.”

Another change in the guidelines that is conspicuously missing scientific backing is a rollback of recommendations to limit alcohol. Gone from the federal guidance is the previous hard limit of no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women. Instead, the guidance encourages Americans to simply drink “less.”

When a reporter asked about this in the press briefing Wednesday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, responded, saying, “alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together.”

“In the best-case scenario, I don’t think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize,” Oz said. “And there’s probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.” While he emphasized small amounts, he went on to note that in “blue zones,” areas where people seem to live long lives, alcohol is part of diets.

“So, there is alcohol on these dietary guidelines, but the implication is don’t have it for breakfast.”

While the guidelines seem favorable for the alcohol industry, overall, the meat and dairy industry are the clear winners, topping the funnel. Documents released alongside the dietary guidelines identify nine experts who helped craft the final document. Of the nine, at least four have had ties to the meat and dairy industry in the past three years. Those include the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, the National Pork Board, the National Dairy Council, and the California Dairy Research Foundation. Two also had links to General Mills, and one was linked to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy among many other medications. The clear conflicts of interest have already drawn criticism from outside nutrition experts.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.” But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers.

Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.

In that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.

The GWL dogs were also able to select the named toys when commanded by their owners, with similar reliance on visual cues—what the toy looks like—augmented by their sense of smell (what the toy smells like), particularly in dark conditions. This confirmed that when dogs play with a toy, they record its features using multiple senses, creating a “multistory mental image.” They prefer to rely primarily on visual cues, but dogs can incorporate other sensory cues, most notably smell, when the conditions call for it.

Last fall, Fugazza’s group built on those findings and concluded that certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but they can also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance. It’s a cognitively advanced ability known as “label extension,” and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. It’s akin to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that “cup” can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler because they serve the same function.

This time, Fugazza et al. wanted to investigate how well GWL dogs listen to and learn from human verbal interactions. So they adapted an experimental protocol used to study this ability in children for their canine subjects. All dogs tend to get very excited about new toys, so the subjects (10 GWL dogs) were allowed to play with two new toys first. Then the owners would spend one minute holding the toy and identifying it with a simple label (“This is Toy A” or “This is Toy B”) while directly addressing their dogs. The dogs then played with the toys (both with their owners and on their own) for several minutes with no further mention of the labels.

This training protocol was repeated twice a day for four nonconsecutive days, followed by a label comprehension test. The two new toys were placed on the floor with nine familiar toys in a room out of the owners’ line of sight. Owners would first ask their dogs to retrieve a familiar toy and then ask them to retrieve a new toy using its label (“Can you bring ?”). The label comprehension test was repeated 12 times for both the familiar and new toys.

Next, the entire experiment was repeated with one key variation: This time, during the training protocol, rather than addressing the dogs directly when naming new toys, the dogs merely watched while their owners talked to another person while naming the toys, never directly addressing the dogs at all.

The result: 80 percent of the dogs correctly chose the toys in the direct address condition, and 100 percent did so in the overhearing condition. Taken together, the results demonstrate that GWL dogs can learn new object labels just by overhearing interactions, regardless of whether the dogs are active participants in the interactions or passive listeners—much like what has been observed in young children around a year-and-a-half old.

To learn whether temporal continuity (a nonsocial factor) or the lack thereof affects label learning in GWL dogs, the authors also devised a third experimental variation. The owner would show the dog a new toy, place it in a bucket, let the dog take the toy out of the bucket, and then place the toy back in. Then the owner would lift the bucket to prevent the dog from seeing what was inside and repeatedly use the toy name in a sentence while looking back and forth from the dog to the bucket. This was followed by the usual testing phase. The authors concluded that the dogs didn’t need temporal continuity to form object-label mappings. And when the same dogs were re-tested two weeks later, those mappings had not decayed; the dogs remembered.

But GWL dogs are extremely rare, and the findings don’t extend to typical dogs, as the group discovered when they ran both versions of the experiment using 10 non-GWL border collies. There was no evidence of actual learning in these typical dogs; the authors suggest their behavior reflects a doggy preference for novelty when it comes to toy selection, not the ability to learn object-label mappings.

“Our findings show that the socio-cognitive processes enabling word learning from overheard speech are not uniquely human,” said co-author Shany Dror of ELTE and VetMedUni universities. “Under the right conditions, some dogs present behaviors strikingly similar to those of young children. These dogs provide an exceptional model for exploring some of the cognitive abilities that enabled humans to develop language. But we do not suggest that all dogs learn in this way—far from it.”

            <h2>Sony Patents AI That Plays Video Games for You If You Get Stuck</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a riotous AI hype cycle, companies are promising that their agentic AIs will —eventually, at least — do everything from your grocery shopping to booking your travel plans.

And what’ll you do with all that extra leisure time? Kick back and play some video games? Or will you deploy yet another AI to play the games for you, while you passively watch like the slack-jawed humans in “WALL-E”?

It might sound like parody, but Japanese tech giant Sony is looking to do exactly that: let an AI navigate PlayStation games on the human player’s behalf. According to a patent filed in September 2024 and surfaced by Video Games Chronicle, the company has plans for a “Ghost Player” that takes over the player’s character to puppet out the solution if they get stuck.

According to the patent, gamers would choose between a “Guide Mode” that shows an AI presenting the proper way forward or a “Complete Mode” that would simply assume control over the player’s character and play the whole thing on their behalf.

It’s an eyebrow-raising example of how companies are looking to use AI to essentially remove human agency, under the guise of making our lives easier. Gamers have turned to walkthroughs and hints for years, but usually after banging their own heads against difficult challenges, and hence learning something in the process.

Technically, accessibility options in video games are nothing new. Many modern titles allow gamers to adjust difficulty on the fly or even skip certain sections if things get too tricky. Sony’s PlayStation 5 console also has a Game Help system, which provides players with easily-accessed guides and hints mid-game.

Adding AI to that paradigm is clearly of interest to the gaming industry. Last year, Microsoft already introduced an Xbox “AI-driven sidekick,” called Copilot for Gaming, that can coach gamers to improve their skills. However, the large language model-based feature is limited to voice and text prompts.

On a broader scale, the use of AI in the video game industry has proven incredibly controversial. Many gamers have reacted with disgust to game studios using AI for creative tasks, like coming up with promotional artwork or generating character voices.

Nonetheless, company leaders like Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney have vowed to use AI in “nearly all future production.”

Whether companies will go as far as to introduce AI agents that play video games on behalf of players remains to be seen — but considering Sony’s patent, they’re certainly already thinking about it.

Gamers aren’t exactly optimistic about AI encroaching on the experience, especially amid deep confusion over how exactly developers and studios are looking to leverage the tech. In a piece for The Gamer, journalist Mike Drucker predicted that 2026 will be the “year that AI in gaming gets super annoying.”

            <h2>Tesla Fan Profusely Praises FSD For Veering His Car off the Side of the Highway</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a Tesla in Full Self-Driving mode suddenly swerved off of a busy highway and almost straight into a ditch, the owner of the vehicle praised the driving technology to high heaven for supposedly saving his skin.

“Tesla FSD saved my life last night on Interstate 95 in South Carolina,” wrote the driver, who goes by the display name “The Electric Israeli.”

“Car in front braked hard suddenly. FSD veered to the left and got back safely on the road,” he explained. “Thank you @Tesla_AI.”

The user, who also calls himself “Dr. Moshe,” helpfully uploaded footage of the incident, and it paints FSD’s supposedly heroic intervention in a far more dubious light.

During a night commute, the video shows the Tesla tailing an SUV in front of it at a reasonable enough distance. But when the SUV brakes and slows down, neither FSD nor Moshe take notice. There’s ample time to react, but instead of gradually slowing down to respond to the SUV in front, the Tesla’s self-driving software brakes at the last second and veers off the road, nearly plunging into the depressed center of the grass median.

The dramatic intervention affords us a view of the road ahead: miles of bumper-to-bumper traffic, meaning that both driver and driving software had no excuse not to be ready for another stop.

Seemingly intended to exculpate FSD, Moshe wrote in a follow-up tweet: “We noticed at the same time.”

Why FSD swerved off the road is anyone’s guess. Hindsight is 20/20, and backseat driving is seldom F1-worthy, but it sure looks like that the Tesla wasn’t in danger of rear-ending the SUV, even though it braked late. The maneuver, we’d hazard, was totally pointless. And had the median been something other than a fairly level stretch of grass, it could’ve ended up a lot worse.

Such is the blind devotion of the Tesla fan. When one man’s Cybertruck running FSD wrapped itself around a pole last year, its owner also praised the automaker. “Thank you @Tesla for engineering the best passive safety in the world,” they wrote after the accident.

A Model Y owner was similarly thankful — or in the owner’s words, “insanely grateful” — after FSD obliterated a deer at full speed while making no attempt to slow down, footage showed, even after acknowledging that Tesla’s service was terrible.

A reminder that Full Self-Driving isn’t actually fully self-driving, and is not classified as autonomous driving software, but rather as a driving assistance feature. Of course, like many Elon Musk products, it commands cultish loyalty even as it’s being investigated by a federal regulator over frequent reports of it driving straight into the path of oncoming trains at railroad crossings. Life-saving tech indeed.

            <h2>Kawasaki’s Robot Horse Is Going Into Production</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in April, we came across a flashy and almost entirely CGI video of a bizarre concept for a rideable, four-legged robotic “horse.”

The video showed the mysterious concept, dubbed Corleo, roaming rocky terrain, leaping over icy crevasses, crossing snowy landscapes without losing its footing, and traversing a dark forest at night — all while carrying an adult rider on its back and being powered by a hydrogen power cell.

While the company behind the idea, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, showed off a full-scale model at an exposition at the time, promising a production-ready device by the far-off date of 2050, we had a lot of trouble believing Corleo was little more than pure vaporware.

But the company has now announced that it’s started to work on turning its ambitious vision into a reality, and decades ahead of schedule. As New Atlas reports, Kawasaki is setting up a dedicated “Safe Adventure Business Development Team,” with the aim of showing off a functioning prototype at the Expo 2030 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The company is hoping to put the unusual motorcycle on legs on sale by 2035, a lofty plan that still keeps the delivery way well in the future to avoid near-term embarrassment — we’re looking at you, Elon Musk!

According to a press release, Kawasaki is also developing a “riding simulator that enables riding experience of the four-legged mobility vehicle.”

Beyond targeting thrill seekers, the company also suggests that Corleo could be used to “eliminate mountain accidents and make mountainous regions safe and enjoyable for everyone.”

Sure, it may sound like a promising start — but there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical. For one, achieving the kind of agility the company showed off in its original marketing video will likely remain an enormous engineering challenge.

What exactly a production-ready prototype will be able to do at the Expo 2030 — a mere four years from now — remains unclear as well.

On the other hand, we’ve seen the field of robotics make major leaps and bounds, with an onslaught of humanoid robots that can dance, kickbox, and even cook up an elaborate breakfast. Four-legged robots have similarly learned to effortlessly navigate rugged landscapes and even herd sheep.

In short, for now we’ll reserve judgment — but we’re nonetheless excited about the prospect of a robotic horse that we can ride into the sunset, not unlike Aloy, the protagonist of the popular video game series “Horizon.”

            <h2>Researchers Just Discovered Something Extremely Unflattering About People Who Believe Conspiracy Theories</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What makes a conspiracy theorist? Is it poor education, an overactive imagination, a tinfoil hat? According to one recent study, it isn’t any of that stuff, but instead something psychologically revealing: a deep insecurity about the world they inhabit.

The study, published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, examined 14 variables in demographics, ideology, and personality for links to conspiratorial thinking. Some 253 adults were recruited to participate in the study, primarily from the UK, US, Canada, and South Africa, with an average age of 49 years old.

Specifically, the researchers were interested in exploring factors that might influence whether a person has “beliefs about cover-ups.” This is the blanket idea that powerful organizations or collectives are concealing the truth from the entire world, which only the conspiracy-minded can see through.

“I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so,” the study’s lead author and professor of psychology at the Norwegian Business School, Adrian Furnham, told PsyPost. “Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up’ perspective of conspiracy believers.”

To consistently measure conspiratorial thinking, the researchers created a 10-point scale, corresponding to responses to statements such as “politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions” and “government agencies closely monitor all citizens.” Participants also took a personality assessment called the High Potential Trait Indicator (HTPI), which measures six traits including competitiveness and tolerance of ambiguity.

When all was said and done, one of the main factors researchers found a strong correlation between endorsement of conspiracy theories and an intriguing characteristic: a low tolerance of ambiguity.

In other words, people who feel insecure or uncomfortable when they don’t know all the answers, or who can’t grasp that some situations are complex, multidimensional, and puzzling even to experts. Presented with a complicated set of issues or events, these folks were more likely to sign on to a hare-brained conspiracy theory that offered an easy answer, even if it was wrong, or an oversimplification.

There was also a significant correlation between those who believe that the world is fundamentally unfair — from a “human nature” point of view — and those who subscribe to far-fetched theories. Those who believe in an “unjust world,” the researchers found, were also more inclined to believe in shadowy groups pulling the strings.

Contrary to what many may think, the researchers found no correlation between a person’s level of education and their capacity to believe in absurd conspiracies. Basically, this suggests that intelligence isn’t a factor determining whether a person falls into a conspiracy rabbithole, which paints a far different picture of conspiracy theorists than the one we typically see.

Going forward, more research with a much larger sample size is needed to expand the findings. Still, it’s a fascinating glimpse at the factors that could shape conspiratorial thinking — concrete evidence that when faced with uncertainty, some of us really do prefer simple lies to complicated truths.

            <h2>Astronaut on Space Station Suffers Medical Issue</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A simple medical issue as mundane as an infection is far more dangerous when orbiting the Earth hundreds of miles above the surface in a confined spacecraft.

Apollo 7 astronaut Wally Schirra famously came down with a nasty head cold a mere 15 hours into the mission in 1967, with ground control warning him he could shatter his eardrums while returning to Earth with bad congestion. Given the lack of gravity, even a runny nose can turn into an extremely unpleasant experience, forcing astronauts to resort to unusual measures just to drain mucus from their nasal passages.

In short, there are compelling reasons to be extremely cautious about any possibility of illness when it comes to space travel, particularly given the lack of comprehensive medical equipment or specialized health professionals in orbit.

That’s why it’s striking that on Thursday, NASA announced that it was forced to postpone a January 8 spacewalk, citing a “medical concern.”

According to the carefully-worded update, the “matter involved a single crew member who is stable.”

The situation is still developing, and we have far more questions than answers. We don’t know if the astronaut has fallen ill or has suffered an injury. However, given NASA’s description, it sounds like it could be a fairly serious situation.

“Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission,” the statement reads, referring to a mission that saw a crew of four travel to the ISS in August on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon.

“These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,” NASA wrote.

The Crew-11 crew, which includes NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, arrived at the station on August 2 and is, at the time of writing, scheduled to return to Earth next month, following the mid-February launch of the Crew-12 launch.

As CNN points out, NASA doesn’t usually speak openly about medical conditions affecting its astronauts. However, there has been plenty of research into the effects of microgravity on the human body.

Prolonged space travel has been shown to affect astronauts’ vision, bone density, and blood circulation. A 2020 study, for instance, points out that blood can clot in an astronaut’s jugular vein, but how much of a danger this poses to astronauts remains unclear.

An astronaut and Crew-8 mission crew member, who returned to Earth in October 2024, had to be hospitalized upon their return. The crew member stayed overnight for observation due to a “minor medical issue.”

“To protect the crew member’s medical privacy, specific details on the individual’s condition or identity will not be shared,” NASA wrote in an update at the time.

To this day, we still don’t know why the astronaut was hospitalized — suggesting we may get little clarity on the currently unfolding situation, either.

However, NASA has promised “further updates within the next 24 hours.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forget Mars. For 28 member of China’s astronaut corps, the brave new world is a dark, damp hole in the ground — cut off from light, wind, and even the internet.

As reported by Space News, the China Astronaut Research and Training Center (CARTC) just wrapped up a month-long training regimen meant to prepare future and veteran astronauts for lunar landing missions. The astronauts were split into four groups, each of which spent nearly a week in underground isolation.

While they were down there, each team completed work in cave mapping, environmental monitoring, long-distance communication, as well as psychological and behavioral training, according to the China National Space Administration.

While it isn’t known which cave the astronauts braved, the CNSA notes the system was located somewhere in the Wulong District of Chongqing. This area is home to massive karst formations like the Wulong Three Bridges, the largest natural stone arches in Asia, as well as the Xiaozhai Heavenly Pit, the world’s largest sinkhole. It also contains the famous Furong Cave, a UNESCO world heritage site and one of the largest limestone caverns in the world.

CARTC researchers had been scouting caves across China for the training program since 2016. At least 10 alternative caves were also considered, in regions like Guangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. After rating each cavern based on metrics like training challenge, geological stability, and safety, program administrators settled on the one in Chongqing, where conditions most accurately resembled the “extreme environment of space,” the CNSA said.

The training mirrored a similar program run by the European Space Agency, called the Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills (CAVES). One of the directors of the Chinese cave training, veteran astronaut Ye Guangfu, also participated in a 2016 CAVES training in a European cavern.

“Compared with the cave training in Europe, our support team inside the cave intervened as little as possible,” Ye told the state news agency Xinhua. “This approach pushed astronauts to rely on their own judgment, unlocking both individual initiative and their full problem-solving potential.”

“It was so dark that I couldn’t see my own hands in front of my face,” Tang Hongbo told the agency. A veteran of the Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17 spaceflight missions, Tang served as commander of the second team to face the underground trials. “In that kind of darkness, the mental pressure is overwhelming.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.

Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.

The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multi-step workflows with a human in the loop.

This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.

“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”

This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.

In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.

The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.

Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.

Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.

OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.

A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.

While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

This family planning tool caught our eyes on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources, create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders, and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Data security startup Cyera continues on a growth tear. On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation.

The new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others.

Cyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities. The rise of AI — which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks — has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.

            <h2>Governments grapple with the flood of non-consensual nudity on X</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two weeks, X has been flooded with AI-manipulated nude images, created by the Grok AI chatbot. An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders.

A December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period.

But while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.

Unsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.

It’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.

In the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”

In a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”

By far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Building software products has never been easier, so why are so many well-funded startups failing to take off no matter how good their product is? In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era.

The traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product.

“The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said.

In this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority.

Early-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said.

Irving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved.

“I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said.

            <h2>Critics pan spyware maker NSO’s transparency claims amid its push to enter US market</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/critics-pan-spyware-maker-nsos-transparency-claims-amid-its-push-to-enter-us-market/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NSO Group, one of the most well-known and controversial makers of government spyware, released a new transparency report on Wednesday, as the company enters what it described as “a new phase of accountability.”

But the report, unlike NSO’s previous annual disclosures, lacks details about how many customers the company rejected, investigated, suspended, or terminated due to human rights abuses involving its surveillance tools. While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either.

Experts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.

Last year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.

“When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,” Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates.

Natalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: “NSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.”

“Changing the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,” said Krapiva.

“However, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.”

“This is nothing but another attempt at window dressing and the U.S. government should not be taken for a fool,” said Krapiva.

Ever since the Biden administration added NSO to the Entity List, the company has lobbied to have its restrictions lifted. After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration.

In late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration’s attitude toward spyware makers.

This year’s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years.

In an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation.

NSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.”

In the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.

In 2021, NSO said it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.”

NSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports.

TechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO.

“I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”

            <h2>The Pentagon Has Axed Its Office of the Arctic</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/pentagon-arctic-greenland-china-russia/685553/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have made a case for acquiring Greenland that’s so simple, even self-evident, it seems hard to refute: U.S. national-security interests in the Arctic are just too important to ignore. Not taking over the autonomous territory of Denmark would “give up the Arctic to China, to Russia, and to other regimes that don’t have the best interests of the American people at heart,” Vice President J. D. Vance declared last March during a visit to the Pituffik Space Base, on Greenland’s northwest coast.

Five years ago, Congress had a similar sense of alarm about Russia and China’s head start in exploring and potentially developing one of the world’s last great untapped regions, with its rich minerals, abundant (if icebound) seas, and strategic location almost connecting the continent of Europe with the northernmost reaches of the Americas.

The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act called for the creation of the Arctic and Global Resilience Policy Office at the Pentagon, which was set up in 2022. The office produced the Defense Department’s 2024 Arctic Strategy, dedicating Washington to increased Arctic defense capabilities, expanded collaboration with allies on Arctic security, and strengthened military readiness for Arctic operations.

The administration’s intense interest in acquiring Greenland, by force if necessary, might appear to be a natural outgrowth of the Pentagon’s work. Instead, it’s a clear repudiation of it. Not only has the demand for Greenland infuriated the same European allies on which the Arctic strategy depends, the Pentagon office itself has been quietly shuttered. In sum, even as the administration says it needs Greenland to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic, it has closed the office set up to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic.

The Arctic was a crucial strategic front in the Cold War, the shortest route for potential missile strikes and bomber flights. The United States and the Soviet Union maneuvered submarines in the region, competing for dominance at the top of the world.

A Cold War–era agreement allows Washington broad authority to conduct military operations on Greenland. The agreement, signed by Denmark and the United States in 1951, allows the U.S. to “construct, install, maintain, and operate” bases across the island, station personnel, and set the terms of “landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements, and operation of ships, aircraft, and water-borne craft.” Pituffik is the only current U.S. base.

As warming seas open new shipping routes and enable access to natural resources, the United States and its adversaries are again scrambling for position in the Arctic. China released a white paper in 2018 that declared itself a “Near-Arctic State,” using this characterization to assert its interests in the region. In 2020, Russia set a 15-year time frame for a set of aspirations in the Arctic, including the establishment of sovereignty over its northern sea route, the revitalization of Soviet-era military bases, and the creation of new commercial-shipping infrastructure. Russia has grown its fleet of icebreakers and other vessels needed to navigate the Arctic’s challenging conditions, and the Russian navy has held joint drills in the region with China, an ominous development for the United States.

The Pentagon’s Arctic office, in its short life, brought together agency leaders on policy planning to ensure that the government had the communication, intelligence, and surveillance tools for effective deterrence alongside allies with regional know-how. When Trump returned to power early last year, his team discussed restructuring the office, but the plans never materialized. It took too long to get leadership into place, especially Elbridge Colby, who wasn’t confirmed as undersecretary of defense for policy until April.

The office began a slow-motion demise as it shed personnel who were never replaced, three former U.S. officials told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. Around the time of the government shutdown last fall, the office effectively ceased to exist. The office’s website now leads to a 404 - Page not found! message. Some of the office’s functions have been moved to other parts of the government, but the number of people working on these issues at the Pentagon has been reduced by almost three-quarters, one of the former officials said. The office’s closure has not been previously reported.

One of the former officials we spoke with said the office was politically vulnerable because it was a creation of the Biden administration and focused in part on responding to climate change. The Pentagon has canceled climate-related programs and sought to weed out contracts and initiatives that even use the word climate. Last spring, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media that his department “does not do climate change crap.”

The policy office’s demise also reflects Trump’s interest in hemispheric dominance. Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson, in a statement, said that the office had not been shut down but rather “restructured to better align with the president’s priorities,” with work parceled out to the office of the assistant secretary responsible for homeland defense and the Americas. That puts strategy for U.S. interests around the North Pole together with Venezuela, the Panama Canal, and the Gulf of Mexico. The Pentagon last summer also shifted Greenland from U.S. European Command, responsible for Europe and Russia, to Northern Command, responsible for North America. An administration official told us the closure of the policy office was designed to achieve greater efficiency and noted that there is still an inter-agency team working on Arctic issues.

Meanwhile, Trump has yet to fill the role of ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, a position created in 2022 at the urging of Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who represents Alaska. Trump did, however, name Jeff Landry, a political ally and the governor of Louisiana, as special envoy to Greenland. Trump justified the appointment by recalling the Louisiana Purchase—the acquisition from the French of territory including land from 15 current states and two Canadian provinces, in 1803—and said Landry had approached him about the job. “He’s very proactive,” Trump told reporters. Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, told us Greenland would be “better served” if it were protected by the U.S.

In unveiling the Arctic strategy in 2024, senior Pentagon officials stressed international cooperation. Amanda Dory, at the time the acting undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that engagement with allies “underpins the whole document and is foundational to our approach to the Arctic.” She saluted “like-minded and highly capable allies” including Denmark, Norway, and two Arctic nations that were new NATO members, Finland and Sweden.

One former U.S. official based in an allied Arctic nation told us these partnerships were the best U.S. asset in the region. “We had great partnerships that were giving us everything we could ask for in the Arctic,” he said. “Going at it alone, we’re not the strongest power in the Arctic. So we gain less by behaving like a hegemonic power than we gained by working with the partners that were there.”

But recently, those alliances have been severely strained, if not broken. Trump’s repeated insistence on obtaining Greenland has prompted a furious reaction from European governments. In the long run, that may leave Washington less able to counter Russian and Chinese maneuvering in the Arctic—if that was indeed Trump’s aim in the first place. The president recently told The Atlantic that Greenland is “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships” (a claim that former officials described as unsupported by evidence), but the administration’s National Security Strategy, issued at the end of last year, seemed to shy from competition with U.S. adversaries in favor of maximizing economic gains. The document envisioned “strategic stability with Russia” and called for a “genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” It made no mention of the Arctic.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/deer-hunting-venison-sale/685537/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The deer were out there. The crisp tracks in the snow made that clear. Three hours into our hunt through the frigid New Hampshire woods, Ryan Calsbeek, a rangy 51-year-old biology professor at Dartmouth, guessed that 200 animals were hiding in the trees around us. Calsbeek and I were 20 feet up a pignut hickory, crouching on a creaky platform. His friend Max Overstrom-Coleman, a stocky 46-year-old bar owner from Vermont, had climbed a distant tree and strung himself up by a harness, readying his crossbow and swaying in the wind. Shivering in camo jackets and neon-orange beanies, we peered into the darkening forest, daring it to move.

I had joined Calsbeek’s December hunt to try to get my hands on high-quality red meat. Calsbeek had yet to kill a deer that season, but in previous years, he told me, a single animal kept his family of four well fed through the winter. His young daughters especially liked to eat deer heart; apparently, it’s marvelously rich and tender. My mouth watered at the thought. The last time I’d tasted venison was more than a decade ago at a fancy restaurant in Toronto, where it was served as carpaccio, drizzled in oil and so fresh that it may as well have pranced out of the woods and onto my plate.

A bounty of such succulent, free-range meat is currently running through America’s backyards. The continental United States is home to some 30 million white-tailed deer, and in many areas, their numbers are growing too rapidly for comfort. Each year, a white-tailed doe can typically birth up to three fawns, which themselves can reproduce as soon as six months later.

Wherever deer are overabundant, they are at best a nuisance and at worst a plague. They trample gardens, destroy farmland, carry ticks that spread Lyme disease, and disrupt forest ecosystems, allowing invasive species to spread. They are involved in tens of thousands of car crashes each year in New York and New Jersey, where state wildlife departments have encouraged hunters to harvest more deer. In especially populated regions, wildlife agencies hire sharpshooters to cull the animals. Last year, New Hampshire legislators expanded the deer-hunting season in an attempt to keep the population under control. By the looks of the forest floor, which was pitted with hoof marks and scattered with marble-shaped droppings, that effort was falling short.

Over the past decade, some states have proposed a simple, if controversial, strategy for bringing deer under control: Couldn’t people like me—who don’t hunt but aren’t opposed to it—eat more venison?

Venison may not be a staple of American cuisine, but it has a place in many people’s diets. Health influencers laud it as a lean, low-calorie, nutrient-dense source of protein. Venison jerky sticks are sold at big-box stores and advertised as snacks for people on Whole30 and keto diets. Higher-end grocery stores, such as Wegmans and Whole Foods, sell ground venison for upwards of $12 a pound, roughly twice the cost of ground beef.

Part of the reason venison is so expensive is that most of it is not homegrown. It’s mostly imported from New Zealand, which has sent more than 5 million pounds of the stuff to the U.S. every year since 2020. Beef, the dominant red meat in the States, has historically been more affordable. But beef prices jumped nearly 15 percent in 2025, and the conventional kind sold in most supermarkets comes from cattle raised in abysmal conditions. If high-quality venison were cheaper and more widely available, it could be an appetizing alternative.

In recent years, a few deer-swamped states, including New Jersey and Maryland, have tried to legalize the sale of hunted venison, which would deliver two key benefits: more deer out of the ecosystem and more venison on people’s plates. Despite the sport’s association with trophies, many deer hunters are motivated by the prospect of obtaining meat, and they can only consume so much. “It’s for your own table,” Overstrom-Coleman said as he fixed climbing sticks onto a tree to form a makeshift ladder. He had already stocked his freezer full of venison this season (“That son of a bitch,” Calsbeek whispered, once we’d left our companion in his tree) and planned, as many hunters do, to donate any excess meat to a food bank.

Hunting is waning in popularity, in part because younger people are less keen on participating than older generations. Efforts to bring in more hunters, such as programs to train women and youth in outdoor skills, are under way in many states. Women are the fastest-growing demographic, and they participate largely to acquire food, Moira Tidball, the executive director at the Cornell Cooperative Extension who leads hunting classes for women, told me. Still, interest is not growing fast enough for the subsistence-and-donation system to keep deer numbers in check.

Read: America needs hunting more than it knows

It’s hard to imagine a better incentive for deer hunting than allowing hunters to sell their venison to stores and restaurants. But the idea is antithetical to a core tenet of American conservation. For more than 100 years, the country’s wild game has flourished under the protection of hunters and their allies, steadfast in their belief that the nation’s animals are not for sale.

The last time this many white-tailed deer roamed America’s woodlands, the country didn’t yet exist. To the English colonists who arrived in the New World, the deer bounding merrily through the forests may as well have been leaping bags of cash. Back home, deer belonged to the Crown, and as such, could be hunted only by the privileged few, Keith Tidball, a hunter and an environmental anthropologist at Cornell (and Moira’s spouse), told me. In the colonies, they were free for the taking.

Colonists founded a robust trans-Atlantic trade for deer hide, a particularly popular leather for making work boots and breeches, which drastically reduced the deer population. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau notes a man who preserved the horns “of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity.” The animals were already close to disappearing from many areas at the beginning of what ecologists have called the “exploitation era” of white-tailed deer, starting in the mid-19th century. Fifty years later, America was home to roughly half a million deer, down 99 percent from precolonial days.

The commerce-driven decimation of the nation’s wildlife—not just deer but birds, elk, bears, and many other animals—unsettled many Americans, especially hunters. In 1900, Representative John Lacey of Iowa, a hunter and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt’s, introduced a bill to ban the trafficking of America’s wildlife. (As Roosevelt, who notoriously hunted to collect trophies, wrote in 1913, “If there is to be any shooting there must be something to shoot.”) The Lacey Act remains one of the most binding federal conservation laws in existence today.

From the May 1906 issue: Camping with President Theodore Roosevelt

The law is partly contingent on state policies, which make exceptions for certain species. Hunters in most states, for example, can legally harvest and sell the pelts of fur-bearing species such as otters, raccoons, and coyotes. But attempts to carve out similar exceptions for hunted venison, including the bills in Maryland and New Jersey, have failed. In 2022, the Mississippi attorney general published a statement that opened up the possibility of legalizing the sale of hunted deer, provoking fierce opposition from hunters and conservationists; today, the option remains open but has not led to any policy changes. Last year, an Indiana state representative introduced a bill that would allow the sale of hunted venison, but so far it has gone nowhere.

The practical reason such proposals keep failing is that allowing the sale of hunted meat would require huge investments in infrastructure. Systems to process meat according to state and federal laws would have to be developed, as would rapid testing for chronic wasting disease, an illness akin to mad cow that could, theoretically, spread to humans who eat infected meat, though no cases have ever been reported. Such systems could, of course, be implemented. Hunted deer is sold in some common grocery stores in the United Kingdom, such as Waitrose and Aldi. (Notably, chronic wasting disease is not a concern there.)

Read: Deer are beta-testing a nightmare disease

Although the sheer abundance of deer makes them easy to imagine as steaks on legs, several experts cautioned that some people’s affection for the animals runs deep. Deer are cute; they’re docile; they’re Bambi. David Drake, a forestry and wildlife professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, likens them to America’s “sacred cow.” As Drake and a colleague have outlined in a paper proposing a model for commercialized venison hunting in the U.S., any modern system would be fundamentally different from the colonial-era approach because it would be regulated, mostly by state wildlife agencies. But powerful coalitions of hunters and conservationists remain both faithful to the notion that wild game shouldn’t be sold and fearful that history will repeat itself. As the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a national hunting association, puts it, “Any effort to recreate markets for game species represents a significant threat to the future of our nation’s sportsmen-led conservation efforts.” Some of the fiercest pushback to the New Jersey law, Drake told me, came from the state wildlife agency.

The only U.S. state with a deer-related exception to the Lacey Act is Vermont. During the open deer-hunting season (which spans roughly from fall to winter in the Northeast) and for 20 days afterward, Vermonters can legally sell any meat that they harvest. This policy was introduced in 1961, and yet, “I am not aware of anyone who actually takes advantage of it,” Nick Fortin, a wildlife biologist at Vermont’s Fish and Wildlife Department, told me. He added that the department, which manages the exasperated homeowners and destabilized forests that deer leave in their path, has been discussing how to raise awareness about the law.

Even after I explained the 1961 law to several Vermont hunters, they were hesitant to sell me any meat. Hunted meat is meant to be shared freely, or at most bartered for other items or goodwill, Greg Boglioli, a Vermont hunter and store owner, told me. I met Boglioli at the rural home of his friend Fred Waite, a lifelong hunter whose front room alone was decorated with 20 deer heads. I had hoped to buy venison from Waite, but he insisted on sharing it for free. After all, he had plenty. His pantry was crammed with mason jars of stewed venison in liver-colored brine. On a table in the living room was the scarlet torso of a deer that his son had accidentally hit with his truck the other day, half-thawed and waiting to be cooked.

During our hunt, I found Overstrom-Coleman to be more open to the idea of selling the venison he hunted. “I guess that would be a pretty excellent way to share it,” he said. Earlier in the season, he’d killed a deer in Vermont, and he was willing to sell me some of the meat the next day. At least, I thought as I stared into the motionless woods, I’d be going home with something.

From the July/August 2005 issue: Masters of the hunt

By the time the sun went down, the only deer I’d seen was a teetering doe in a video that Overstrom-Coleman had taken from his tree and sent to Calsbeek. “Too small to kill,” he texted; he’d meet us in the parking lot. The air was glacial as Calsbeek and I trudged empty-handed toward the trailhead, hoofprints glinting mockingly in the light of our headlamps. From the trunk of the car, we took a consolation swig of Wild Turkey from a frosted bottle, and Overstrom-Coleman reminded me to visit the next day.

I found his chest freezer stuffed with paper-wrapped packages stamped with Deer 2025. He handed me three and refused to let me pay. Back home a few days later, I used one to make meatballs. Their sheer depth of flavor—earthy and robust, with a hint of nuttiness—made me wonder why I bothered to eat farmed meat at all.</div>

The transformation of ICE into a type of national police force, backed, in some cases, by soldiers from the National Guard, has been covered as immigration story—but these forces are reshaping democracy for all of us. This shift was evident even before the shootings in Minneapolis and Portland this week. In this episode, George Retes, a U.S. citizen and an Army veteran, recounts how he was detained by ICE and held for three days without explanation. The Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum returns as host of Autocracy in America and talks with Margy O’Herron and Liza Goitein from the Liberty & National Security Program at NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice about the potential impact of these forces on elections in November.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum.

Applebaum: In this new season, I am going to ask how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of US politics, and introduce you to some of the Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. The president and his entourage are accumulating power in ways that seem familiar to me: this is exactly how elected leaders in other countries have distorted their democracies. I want to understand how these kinds of changes work here, and what they bode for the future.

George Retes: My name is George Retes Jr. I’m 25 years old. I was born and raised here in Ventura, California. I’m a father of two, and yeah, I’m a U.S. citizen. The day I was arrested by ICE agents was July 10.

Applebaum: This first episode will focus on an issue you’ve probably heard about: the transformation of America’s immigration and customs officers into a masked and heavily armed paramilitary, and the deployment of the National Guard to American cities, supposedly to defend them. Americans may think of this as a change that mostly affects illegal immigrants, but this new federal police force is also establishing standards of lawlessness, and they are operating with an assumption of impunity that is changing the lives of U.S. citizens as well.

George Retes has already felt the impact.

Retes: I was driving to my workplace, where I work as a contracted security guard. When I pulled up, there’s just cars on that entire road, bumper-to-bumper—people getting out, just cars driving around each other. And I was like, All right, well, I just need to make it to work. So I make my way through, and it’s just this roadblock of ICE agents just standing across the road.

Retes: There’s people banging on trash cans and just yelling and stuff. I got out and I stood right by my car. I’m basically yelling at them, like, I’m a U.S. citizen. I’m a veteran. I’m just trying to get to work. I’m not protesting. I’m just trying to get to work. I thought everything was gonna be okay, and they just were hostile from the get-go.

Like, You’re not going to work today. Get back in your car. Leave. So I end up getting back in my car, and they just all start walking in a line towards me, and they just surround my car. I have the agents on the side trying to pull on my door handles, trying to open my car door, yelling at me to get out, and the agents in the front of my car are telling me to reverse, contradicting what these other agents are telling me to do.

They end up throwing tear gas. And I’m in there choking, trying to plead with them, like, I can’t see; my car’s engulfed in smoke, and eventually they hit my window again, and it just shatters. Immediately, the moment it shatters, another agent sticks his arm through and sprays me in the face with pepper spray.

They just dragged me out of the car, threw me on the ground. They just immediately kneeled on my neck and back. There’s maybe four or five other agents just standing around us, just watching as they do this. And the entire time, they’re just questioning, like, Why was he arrested? basically. Like, they were confused themselves.

Eventually, they put me back in this unmarked SUV, and then they end up driving me to the detention facility in downtown L.A. They strip-search us, they do our fingerprints, take our pictures. My hands are burning. My face is burning from tear gas still, and the entire time I was in there, no phone call, no lawyer, no shower. No nothing.

I was detained for three nights and three days. That Saturday was my daughter’s third birthday party, and that was probably the worst feeling ever. She’s my princess. It was just terrible.

So Sunday, a guard ends up coming up and is just like, You’re off, like, He’s getting released, and that’s all he says. That was it. They’re like, You’re free to go. All the charges had been dropped; you’re free to go. And I just asked them, “So I basically was locked up and missed my daughter’s birthday for no fucking reason?” And they just were silent. They just stayed silent. I was given no explanation, no apology, just: That’s it.

Retes: When I was locked up, just that entire time, I knew If I get out of here, I’m definitely gonna take legal action. I was gonna make my voice heard because that’s the only way to hold them accountable for what they did. Someone has to be held accountable. Treating people a certain way without dignity or respect or humanity is so fucking wrong. To not have any fucking rights, especially here in America, when that’s what we’re supposed to be all about—it’s wrong. It goes against everything we stand for. And so I hope that the justice system, even though I don’t believe it works all the time, I hope that in this case it works.

Applebaum: By one count from ProPublica, over 170 American citizens, like George Retes, have already been detained by ICE.

The unnecessary deployment of armed agents onto peaceful streets has also led to tragedy.

This week a woman was shot dead in her car by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Last September a man was shot and killed by ICE outside Chicago.

And last November, an Afghan refugee shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., and has been charged with the murder one of them, a 20-year-old woman from West Virginia. She had been deployed, frankly, for symbolic reasons, to demonstrate Trump’s control over the military, and over the nation’s capital, and she was murdered, it seems, because she served as a symbol of that American military power. The assailant has pled not guilty.

ICE, and the use of the National Guard to protect ICE, has been covered as immigration story, but America’s immigration and customs agents aren’t only being used for that purpose.

The Trump administration is also using ICE and the National Guard to project power, to demonstrate that it can operate without restraint, and in defiance of the law.

How is the deployment of these agents and soldiers legal? Has anything like this ever happened before? It seems any American can now be detained or harassed, or even killed. The American National Guard can be used as puppets in a presidential game—is that legal too?

I asked two experts from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU what we should be doing to secure our own safety, and to preserve our democracy. (We spoke before the killing in Minneapolis this week.)

Our first guest, Margy O’Herron, has documented the transformation of ICE. I started by asking her about the George Retes story and what ICE is supposed to do when it picks up a citizen. (And we should add here that ICE did not respond to questions from The Atlantic about the Retes case.)

Margy O’Herron: When ICE discovers that somebody is a citizen, they are supposed to release them right away. I think what you’re seeing, too, is just a bigger phenomenon of unchecked, chaotic deportation and arrest that is dangerous, and it risks all of our rights.

Applebaum: Okay, so citizens who are detained are supposed to have a certain set of rights, though even those now seem to be at risk. What about noncitizens?

O’Herron: There’s one key fact that I think is different, that I think is really important for folks to understand. And that is that the immigration system is considered a civil system. So this is not law enforcement in the sense of going after criminals. The great majority of immigrants in the system are actually only being charged with a civil offense, if anything, and that is: You are in the country without permission, and there is a civil process to remove you. Because of that, many of the rules that do apply in the criminal context, like right to counsel, do not apply in the civil context. But they’re operating much as if these folks are criminals. They’re arresting them. They’re detaining them. And the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment do still apply to immigrants. They apply to immigrants in the same way that they apply to citizens. There’s no distinction in the law. So without those things, ICE is arresting people and taking people out of the country without any kind of process, without alerting them that they’re going, without allowing them to talk to a lawyer—that is not lawful; it’s unconstitutional. Those rights exist, and they should be protected.

Applebaum: Trump’s big spending bill, which he called the One Big Beautiful [Bill] Act, will allocate over $170 billion to border and immigration enforcement, with a significant amount going to ICE. Can you give us some idea of the scale of the spending? What does it allow ICE to do that’s different from what Immigration [and Customs Enforcement] was allowed to do in the past?

O’Herron: Just to put it in context, it’s $170 billion over four years, but across the country, all states and local law enforcement, in a year, spent about $135 billion [in 2021]. And the money going to ICE is triple what they were authorized before. And what it means is that the types of raids that we’ve seen and the scale of detention that we’ve seen are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s going to increase significantly as they start spending all of those funds.

Applebaum:  Also, of course, all this funding is going to law enforcement, and very little is going to the judges or the immigration courts that for a long time have been the places where people targeted for deportation were allowed to state their case or make their arguments.

O’Herron:  Exactly right. So you see a 400 percent increase in detention and a 14 percent increase for the number of judges. We’ve also seen attacks on the immigration courts and immigration judges. The administration has fired more than 80 immigration judges, mostly for no cause. They’re claiming this is the right of the president to decide who’s an immigration judge. One assumes that they’re being fired because their positions or history or background is something that this current administration does not like. And they’re proposing now to replace those fired immigration judges with military lawyers. And although there are excellent lawyers in the military, they are not trained as immigration judges. And without that training, without that background, it suggests that there’s something else at work. And the fear will be that those judges are there to rubber-stamp the administration’s broader deportation agenda.

Applebaum:  As the money starts to get spent, what are some changes that all of us will see, that people not directly involved in immigration, immigration enforcement, or who aren’t immigrants themselves—what will we see? How will we be affected?

O’Herron: I think we’ll see increased raids and surveillance the way that we’ve seen things happening in Chicago and Los Angeles—roving patrols of ICE agents and also other law enforcement that’s been assigned to support ICE, right? So we now have: Customs and Border Protection, which is used to operating at the border, is supporting ICE. We also have more than 2,000 other federal law-enforcement agents—I think The Washington Post reported that 25 percent of FBI agents are now detailed over to do law enforcement of civilians in the immigration system. And that’s a huge shift from having law enforcement go after who we’d consider to be bad guys, to instead go after immigrants who have done nothing except enter the country unlawfully. And even the number of people that have entered the country unlawfully is lower than the number of people that they’re arresting. Of the folks that are being arrested, 70 percent have absolutely no criminal background, and of the folks that do, there is a very slim number that have any kind of violent criminal background. Most have property crimes or—

Applebaum: Parking tickets, I read in one case.

O’Herron: Parking tickets, even. Correct. And so you’ve taken your FBI agent who’s well trained to go after a drug trafficker or child predator, and instead you have them going after a landscaper or a guy who works at the car wash—to go after civilians.

Applebaum: If this is illegal, if it breaks existing laws, why can’t courts seem to stop this kind of behavior?

O’Herron: I think the courts have been stopping this behavior, or at least they’re trying. There have been some really important rulings out of both Chicago and Los Angeles, which is where we’ve seen a lot of violence against immigrants in the last few months. A district court in Los Angeles, for example, ruled that ICE could not arrest immigrants without reasonable suspicion and couldn’t rely on certain factors, like race and speech, to support that reasonable-suspicion determination. That order was stayed by the Supreme Court, unfortunately. But in the intervening period, while the court’s order was in effect, those orders were followed.

Applebaum: But it’s not stopping them from continuing to arrest people.

O’Herron: Well, I think there is a sense from the top that the agents who are taking these actions are not gonna have any consequences for those actions. For example, there was a video that circulated quite broadly of a woman who was pushed by an ICE agent outside the New York immigration office. She was shoved across a hallway, and she fell. She ended up being hospitalized. Initially, ICE came out with a statement that said that type of action was unacceptable, but a few days later, it was reported that that ICE agent was back on the job.

The administration also has cut many of the oversight offices that are supposed to be places that compile and check that kind of abuse. These are really important offices that field thousands of complaints every year on exactly this kind of behavior. And instead, now we have to rely on the courts exclusively to take these actions.

Applebaum: Taking a step back, it seems that what you are saying is that we are granting a heavily armed federal police force permission to break the law with impunity. They are not punished for either illegal or unethical actions, and no one is keeping track.

O’Herron: You can still file a complaint with ICE. And even though that may seem like a futile exercise, it is really important for tracking what is happening. Those records are then available by [the Freedom of Information Act]. They’re available to Congress. They will be available to some future administration to be able to identify what has happened and provide redress.

Applebaum: It looks to me like the nature of immigration enforcement is changing, that it’s beginning to look something a lot more like the War on Terror.

O’Herron: Yeah, I think that’s right. What we now see is a very heavy, militarized law-enforcement presence with very little oversight. You’ve got ICE agents and their law-enforcement partners using—they’re dressed like military soldiers. They are using military weapons. They are rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters. They’re using flash-bang grenades to clear out buildings.  They’re zip-tying the elderly, children as a way of evacuating a building. These are tools that are used by armed soldiers against enemies—not that we use against civilians.

So I do think there is an effort to terrorize, to intimidate, and probably to get people to self-deport or to not come in the first place. And I think it also is an effort to enforce this narrative that we’re going after the worst of the worst. That has been the line that the administration has been using, but that’s not what they’re actually doing. By making it look like they need all of this backup, they need this heavy-duty equipment, it suggests that that is in fact what they’re doing. But the data does not support that claim.

Applebaum: So they’re trying to convince people that this is a real military operation against real terrorists. They even made a recruiting video out of the raid that deployed Black Hawk helicopters, making it seem something like the Marines in Iraq. But even that raid, it was allegedly meant to target a Venezuelan gang, and yet no one who was detained appears to be a member of a gang, or even a criminal. So it seems that it’s ordinary people.

O’Herron: Correct. Being pulled out of, you know, in the middle of the night to sit in the cold and wait for a chance to say that they’re a citizen.

Applebaum: We’ve been talking about ICE, but that is only one aspect of the new military presence on America’s streets. The other is the National Guard.

Liza Goitein: To me, a police state is a place where the presence of, whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement, is so heavy that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

Applebaum: In addition to ICE, President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard in several big cities. I’ve seen them hanging around Metro stops in Washington, D.C., fully armed, which I find very jarring. I asked my second guest, Liza Goitein, also of the Brennan Center, whether there are any precedents for this.

Goitein: No president has used the military domestically in the way that President Trump is using the military.

Goitein: Never. For street crime? In our nation’s history, presidents have deployed troops to quell civil unrest or to enforce the law a total of 30 times. And the last time was in 1992, so over 30 years ago.

So what we’re seeing now, not only has Trump deployed the military into American cities three times in just over eight months in office, compared to 30 times in the nation’s entire history before this, but he’s also doing it in circumstances where it just hasn’t been done this way before.

Applebaum: Right, so neither is the state asking for help, nor is the state acting in violation of federal law. So there’s no—none of the excuses that have ever been used before are being used.

Goitein: Exactly. I mean, the only time I think the military has been used for street crime was in Hawaii during World War II when Congress authorized martial law. And Hawaii wasn’t a state at the time. Having said that, the law is—it’s 10 USC § 12406. I wish it had a catchy name.

Goitein: It doesn’t. Okay, so I’m just gonna call it Section 12406. And that’s a law that allows the president to federalize National Guard forces. Now, this law has never been used to deploy troops to quell civil unrest, at least not on its own. He’s using it in an unprecedented way.

Applebaum: And he’s doing so on the grounds that there’s an emergency, right? He’s claiming he’s claiming emergency powers. There’s a very bad tradition of leaders using emergencies to do things that are illegal. I mean, it goes back to the 1930s and earlier.

Goitein: Well, yeah, and it’s a hallmark of authoritarian regimes around the world, because emergency powers free leaders from legal constraints that they would otherwise face. And so there’s obviously a temptation to either exploit real crises or to manufacture crises in order to act without these legal limits.

Right. Of course the president has already used exaggerated claims about “unrest,” and therefore “emergency,” in Portland to try to justify the use of troops there, possibly after being shown outdated video. Historically, wars have also given leaders an excuse to crack down on protest or to claim emergency powers. You know in the run up to the U.S. incursion into Venezuela, I did wonder whether the purpose was to create a reason for the president to declare an emergency. Which leads me to the next question, which is whether the military is now at risk of becoming a political tool, used by the White House, not to defend Americans from their enemies, but to promote the President’s power or status and to punish his enemies.

Goitein: When soldiers are dragged into what is widely perceived to be a domestic political fight, that this—first of all, it’s really bad for the morale of the soldiers. That’s not why they enlisted. They don’t like being dragged into politics. But also, it undermines public trust in the military. When you do that, that really weakens our military, when it cannot appeal to and draw from all sectors of the U.S. population, when it loses the public confidence.

And you have to worry about the long-term effects on the military in terms of who is going to join up and who’s going to stay in the military. And increasingly, are we going to see that the people who enlist, the people who stay in the military, are people who either agree with the president’s political agenda, agree that the military should be used to police fellow Americans, or at least are okay with the military being used in that way? And that would very fundamentally and dangerously change what our military is.

Applebaum: Yeah. One of the sources of legitimacy of the U.S. military is that it is perceived as bipartisan, and it is perceived as an institution that protects all of us. And so, presumably, if it loses that, then it loses some of its legitimacy in the eyes of Americans.

Goitein: Absolutely. And that’s really one of the main dangers of what’s happening now that I think not enough people are focused on.

Applebaum: Let me ask you a different question about the future: Do you think, as some governors have warned, that the deployment of armed forces on our streets—National Guard, ICE, and others—will be used to shape public opinion in the run-up to midterm elections this year and maybe during the elections themselves?

Goitein: Yeah, there’s certainly a risk that the president would attempt to deploy troops around the time of an election on the theory that people are less likely to come out and vote if they think that the streets are gonna be full of, you know, heavily armed, federal law enforcement or military troops. That’s going to dissuade some people from getting out and exercising the right to vote.

You really have to worry that not only that this is happening so often—we’re seeing a routinization of the use of the military domestically—but also that we’re seeing a real creep in terms of what it’s being used for. So first it started with protests against ICE raids that were supposedly interfering with ICE’s ability to conduct those raids. Then it was general crime control in Washington, D.C., and you have to wonder what the next reason is going to be. Now, it might continue for a while to be crime control or, you know, protests. But the next reason could be claims of voter fraud, which is a phenomenon that is statistically almost nonexistent.

Applebaum: So you could imagine ICE or the military being used to police polling stations?

Goitein: Well, no, they can’t be used to police polling stations. No. The law very explicitly says that U.S. military and federal armed agents cannot be present at polling stations unless force is necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States. We do have these very strong laws in place that prohibit interference with elections generally and specifically by the military. So that’s off the table. Or at least if they were to do it, it would be flagrantly and obviously illegal.

Applebaum: So technically, we have laws on the books that should prevent troops from being used inside a polling booth. But this administration has already demonstrated that it’s willing to break laws. And maybe, one of the purposes of troop deployment in cities is just to create a general climate of fear, to make people afraid to participate in public life?

Goitein: I mean, it’s certainly the predictable effect of deploying the military on the streets on a sort of routinized basis—to change people’s behavior so that they are afraid to exercise their rights, so that they do behave differently.

So my concern is that we’re moving towards a status quo in which the cities of this country really feel like police states. And to me, a police state is a place where the presence of—whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement—is so heavy and the chill on people’s exercise of their rights is so acute that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

I personally know several people who are U.S. citizens or immigrants who are lawfully in this country, who have told me that they are staying inside as much as they can, and not going out unless they have to.

Goitein: To me that kind of chill and that kind of change in behavior is what really marks life in a police state.

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Until recently, Donald Trump was consistent about this: The time for the United States to police the world, enforcing laws and norms, was over. “We are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world,” he told The New York Times in 2016.

“We more and more are not wanting to be the policemen of the world,” he said during a press conference with Nigeria’s president in 2018. “We’re spending tremendous amounts of money for decades policing the world, and that shouldn’t be the priority.” During the 2020 campaign, he often included a line in his stump speech complaining that American troops had spent 19 years serving as “policemen” in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Trump also rejected the idea that the United States had any kind of moral standing to criticize, much less regulate, the behavior of other nations. When Bill O’Reilly objected to Trump’s warmth toward Vladimir Putin in 2017, the president scoffed: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

If anyone gave the U.S. the benefit of the doubt then, Trump has squandered the possibility now. In his second term, Trump has returned the nation to its role as global policeman—but this time, it’s as the world’s dirty cop, running rackets and thumbing its nose at the law even as it cracks down on alleged criminality by other countries’ leaders. He launched air strikes on Christmas Day in Nigeria, the very country he held up eight years ago as one where the U.S. shouldn’t be involved. Days later, U.S. troops snatched the Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro and his wife in Caracas. Trump told the Times yesterday that the U.S. could spend years controlling Venezuela. This week, the Trump aide Stephen Miller all but announced plans to annex Greenland.

Although the idea of a global policeman originated as a metaphor, the White House has made it literal. Take the boat strikes in the Caribbean, where U.S. law-enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration have long operated. But whereas previous administrations have used law-enforcement agencies to police drug trafficking, the Trump administration has chosen to rely on the armed forces. He has instructed them to conduct lethal, extrajudicial, and likely illegal drone strikes, even as the administration argues that it need not notify Congress of the actions under the War Powers Resolution because U.S. troops are not in danger. As for the raid in Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also described Maduro’s capture as “a law-enforcement operation,” telling George Stephanopoulos, “We didn’t occupy a country. This was an arrest operation.”

This takes some intellectual contortions to accept. Although officials say that the Justice Department wrote a memo justifying the action legally, the administration has not publicly shared the rationale, and international-law experts have almost unanimously agreed that the U.S. violated international law to arrest Maduro this way. In domestic policing, Trump has long espoused what I call “lawless order”—the idea that those in power can break the law in order to achieve their idea of society—and the president is now extending that to the rest of the world.

This is only one of the inconsistencies that characterize Trump’s approach to law and order. A justice system depends on the idea that laws and enforcement are reasonably consistent and predictable, but Trump offers none of that. On the one hand, he has arrested Maduro and brought him to the U.S., and plans to try him for drug trafficking. On the other, he last month pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who had been convicted and imprisoned in the United States on very similar charges. He has correctly labeled Maduro an “illegitimate dictator,” but he has made the self-described Salvadoran dictator Nayib Bukele a key ally and welcomed him to the White House. Trump isn’t the best avatar of legal probity himself: He was convicted of 34 felonies in 2024, and escaped trial on several more serious ones only by virtue of being elected president.

What Trump is doing in Venezuela and beyond isn’t enforcing norms and ensuring security. It’s finding a way to make a buck. If you listened to Trump closely when he was rejecting intervention in the past, he hinted at this possibility. Although he complained about American troops being dispatched around the world, he often added that the problem was that the U.S. didn’t receive any direct, immediate monetary compensation for it. (The Iraq War was a mistake, he argued, not because it failed to achieve geopolitical change but because the U.S. didn’t take Iraq’s oil.)

Now he’s out to get his cut. He has openly acknowledged that the U.S. got involved in Venezuela because of oil, and the administration has declared its intent to control the country’s petroleum industry “indefinitely.” In the Arctic Circle, he’s attempting to establish a protection racket, arguing that Denmark doesn’t have the means to defend Greenland. Nice island you got there. Be a shame if something happened to it.

The U.S. has, in the past, made common cause with dictators when expedient, overthrown democratically elected leaders when nervous, and stayed out of righteous causes when doubtful of the upsides of getting involved; presidents have made moves to boost the U.S. economy or their own political prospects. The war hero Smedley Butler famously accused the U.S. government of racketeering in 1935. But even purported deference to a higher principle constrained and directed the shape of global involvement. Trump has abandoned that pretense, and no one dares to stop him. He is getting his way right now, but the long-term effects may be dangerous: When a dirty cop walks the beat, he encourages bad behavior in his precinct rather than suppressing it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

An Underappreciated Variable in Sports Success

Chief among the burdens weighing upon the weary sports parent—worse than the endless commutes, the exorbitant fees, the obnoxious parents on the other team—is the sense that your every decision has the power to make or break your child’s future. Should your 11-year-old show up to her elementary-school holiday concert, even if it means missing a practice with the elite soccer team to which you’ve pledged 100 percent attendance? What if this turns out to be the fork in the road that consigns her to the athletic scrap heap? …

Rationally, stressing out over missing a single practice is ridiculous. Believing that it matters, though, can be strangely reassuring, because of the suggestion that the future is under your control. Forecasting athletic careers is an imperfect science: Not every top draft pick pans out; not every star was a top draft pick. Unexpected injuries aside, the imprecision of our predictions is usually seen as a measurement problem. If we could only figure out which factors mattered most—how to quantify talent, which types of practice best develop it—we would be able to plot athletic trajectories with confidence.

Unless, of course, this tidy relationship between cause and effect is an illusion. What if the real prerequisite for athletic stardom is that you have to get lucky?

Explore. A theme keeps popping up in relationship advice, Julie Beck writes: Don’t vent so much.

Read. The philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s latest book explores a new understanding of human beings’ most basic desire, John Kaag writes.

Over the past 15 or 20 years, I’ve watched as the Grateful Dead has gone from casually dismissed sideshow to critical touchstone, cited by even the coolest bands as an influence. I’d like to say that I was ahead of the curve, but I can’t take much credit: My parents, longtime Deadheads, indoctrinated me from an early age. I recently filmed a video as part of The Atlantic’s “Behind the Byline” series where I talk about the Dead—and get quizzed on how fast I can name that tune and identify the era. To be honest, my colleague Matteo Wong’s advice on pasta might be more useful.

            <h2>The Early Days of American Imperialism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/old-american-imperialism-trump-power-abroad/685558/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic’s archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

Exactly 39 years after Julia Ward Howe’s “Battle Hymn of the Republic” was first published in The Atlantic, Mark Twain scratched out a new version. “Battle Hymn,” which Twain considered “beautiful and sublime,” was in need of revision. In 1901, the United States was entering the third year of a war to establish colonial rule in the Philippines, and Howe’s rousing vision of a sacred national struggle didn’t quite fit the moment. “Mine eyes have seen the orgy of the launching of the Sword,” Twain began. “He is searching out the hoardings where the stranger’s wealth is stored.” The rest of the verses deal in similar substitutions: a bandit gospel for a fiery gospel; instead of truth and God, lust and greed go marching on.

Twain’s satire worked because it exposed the hypocrisies of America’s first embrace of an overseas empire at the turn of the 20th century. Advocates of intervention spoke confidently of spreading democracy; Twain and other anti-imperialists answered by holding those professed ideals up against the anti-democratic reality of conquest and violence. This pattern of argument would persist through the Iraq War. The guiding questions were always around what we really believed we were doing in other countries—spreading democracy, or simply exploiting people and advancing our interests? With this weekend’s ouster of Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, America has crossed into a new era, in which leaders no longer bother with the pretense.

Twain and the anti-imperialists were processing what seemed like a profound turn in American history. Prior conquest of North America was the real beginning of American imperialism, and the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 anticipated advances in the Pacific. But the Spanish-American War of 1898—what the Atlantic editor Walter Hines Page deemed “a necessary act of surgery for the health of civilization”—commenced a new phase of overseas empire. The United States made Cuba something of a protectorate, formally annexed Hawaii, and added Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines as part of the Spanish-American War peace treaty.

For the champions of empire, 1898 presented a kind of deliverance. Americans would take their rightful place on the global stage alongside the Europeans, bringing democracy, civilization, commerce, and Christianity with them. White American men, thought to have become feminized and overcivilized by domestic comforts, could redeem themselves in the process of occupying their new colonial possessions. American workers of all kinds would be rescued from what many believed to be the dangers of excessive production, with ready markets for their goods beyond American borders. God “has marked us as his chosen people, henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world,” Senator Albert Beveridge of Indiana boasted. “We are trustees of the world’s progress, guardians of its righteous peace.”

The reality on the ground did not match the rhetoric, particularly in the Philippines. Purchased for $20 million from Spain in the peace proceedings, the archipelago promised access to the Chinese market—and a laboratory for a benevolent theory of American empire. “If we can benefit those remote peoples,” President William McKinley had asked, “who will object?” But his promise that “our priceless principles undergo no change under a tropical sun” did not survive the Pacific crossing. American forces worked to crush something they knew well—a popular uprising against colonial rule. The methods the army employed were brutal, including a water torture and rounding suspected rural insurgents into concentration camps—a tactic practiced by the Spanish in Cuba that had helped galvanize American support for war there.

Twain was horrified by the violence, but he was particularly enraged about the redemptive rhetoric that cloaked it. “We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem,” he told a reporter in 1900. His many subsequent published writings opposing American imperialism (as well as his version of the “Battle Hymn,” which he did not publish but was found written into a book he owned) were works of bitter satire highlighting the disconnect between the reality of conquest and the language of redemption. In “To the Person Sitting in Darkness,” Twain extracted what he called “the Actual Thing”—war, violence, greed exploitation—from the “outside cover” of the “Blessings of Civilization.” The United States had become “yet another Civilized Power, with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and its loot-basket and its butcher-knife in the other.”

The anti-imperialist movement that Twain joined was a motley gathering of both moral idealists and virulent racists who scorned even association with nonwhite people, much less their elevation. But insofar as Twain’s satire worked, it did so because it presumed that American ideals mattered—and that their violation did too. Even those who were less concerned about the violence or the fate of nonwhite people could note the disconnect between America as an anticolonial nation practicing colonialism. During the 1900 presidential election, Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan responded to Republican censure of his anti-imperial stance with the suggestion that they extend their censure to Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln.

Neither Twain nor Jennings Bryan stopped the drift toward overseas intervention that had begun in 1898. Theodore Roosevelt, elevated to the vice presidency by the spectacle of his famous charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba, would tender an even more forceful expression of American power after he became president. Such expressions would only grow through the remainder of the century. But even the most strident interventionists felt compelled to temper their justifications with the language of anti-imperialism. “We don’t seek empires,” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said a few months into the second Iraq War. “We’re not imperialistic. We never have been.”

President Trump and his administration have upended this American tradition of claiming, however hypocritically, that foreign intervention is not about power or profit. In the days since Maduro’s capture, the president has repeatedly bragged about being “in charge” of Venezuela, and suggested that the U.S. might run the country for years. He has openly explained that his priority is taking control of the country’s oil business to make the U.S. wealthier (a plan that’s not economically sound, as my colleague Jonathan Chait points out). Earlier this week, the State Department’s social-media account shared a post reading “THIS IS OUR HEMISPHERE,” while Representative Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, repeated the boast in a television interview on Wednesday: “We are the dominant predator force in the Western hemisphere.”

The absence of urgency to empower the democratic opposition, or even to pay lip service to the goal of restoring liberal democracy within the country, marks a new form of American intervention abroad. To this administration, the show of force is a good in itself—no pandering to ideals required. With America’s goals so clearly laid out, it’s not clear what good satire might do, or how much use Mark Twain might be now. The administration’s posturing suggests that even the oil might be beside the point. The most valuable resource has perhaps already been extracted: the spectacle of power itself.</div>

            <h2>Trump Has Odd Views on Domestic Terrorism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-ice-minnesota-january-6/685555/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 6, Donald Trump’s administration published an apologia for the Trump supporters whom he incited to storm the Capitol five years earlier. The next day, Stephen Miller, in response to news that an ICE agent had shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, lambasted the Democratic Party on X for “inciting a violent insurrection.”

The juxtaposition of the January 6 anniversary and the shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota the next day is a coincidence of timing. But the echo of language between that which the Trump administration has attacked (alleged violence against federal law-enforcement officers) and that which it has defended (actual violence against federal law-enforcement officers) is striking.

President Trump’s long-standing view has become official policy: His supporters are definitionally “patriotic” and therefore entitled to take any actions on his behalf, regardless of how violent or illegal they may be. His opponents are definitionally terrorists, and therefore constitute legitimate targets of state violence. This is how an organized mass attack to overthrow the government becomes “peaceful” and “patriotic,” while a single woman attempting to flee ICE agents constitutes a violent attempt to overthrow the government.

Adam Serwer: First the shooting. Then the lies.

It is possible that the ICE officer who shot Good feared that she intended to drive her car into him. But video documentation shows that she was turning her car away from the officer when he shot her. Although it remains unclear whether her car grazed him, videos show the officer running down the street to check on Good, then walking away unaided. As for Good, her ex-husband has told Minnesota Public Radio that she was not a political activist—she had never protested anything, to his knowledge—and that she had merely been caught in the vicinity of the ICE raid after dropping off her 6-year-old at school.

The Trump administration, however, immediately circulated a fantasy version of what happened.

In a message on Truth Social, Trump recited what has become the new MAGA talking points. The president called Good part of a “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate” and charged that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.” He added, “It is hard to believe he is alive.”

Vice President J. D. Vance insisted that the officer was “defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over.” The Homeland Security Department described the shooter as bravely saving “his own life, as well as the lives of his fellow officers” from “an anti-ICE rioter” engaged in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

What’s notable about these hysterical claims is how far they go beyond the simplest possible defense. The administration is not merely insisting that the ICE officer believed Good’s car might strike him, an argument that might have reframed the shooting as a tragic error. Instead, they have presented the shooting as absolutely necessary—an act of patriotism, even—and its victim as an unhinged would-be murderer posing a threat to the republic.

This account is especially jarring when read in contrast with the White House’s stream of lies about January 6. (National Review’s Noah Rothman has written an excellent point-by-point refutation.) The administration’s revisionist history not only says that the insurrection was just a peaceful march that went awry because of mistakes made by the Capitol Police; it also says that Ashli Babbitt, an actual rioter who attempted to breach a barricaded room protecting members of Congress, was “Murdered in Cold Blood” by a Capitol Police officer.

There is no objective standard of conduct that could possibly explain why beating police officers is peaceful but attempting to flee from them is terrorism. This is not an oversight, but the essence of Trumpism. This administration believes that it is entitled to do as it pleases. Its perceived enemies are entitled to nothing.</div>

I found the quote attributed to a park ranger at Yosemite NP back in the 80s.

Back in the 1980s, Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem with bears: They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage bins. This put both bears and people at risk. So the Park Service started installing armored garbage cans that were tricky to open—you had to swing a latch, align two bits of handle, that sort of thing. But it turns out it’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans just right. Make it too complex and people can’t get them open to put away their garbage in the first place. Said one park ranger, &quot;There is considerable overlap between the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.&quot; https://www.schneier.com/blog/... [schneier.com]

Yes. Scheier on Security (already linked by CaptQuark). I use that in my IT Security lectures to illustrate human limitations, together with the Dunning-Kruger effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), the &quot;shooting the messenger&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_the_messenger) extreme management failure, and the Peter Principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle).

Together with greed, maliciousness and arrogance, these explains maybe 95% of all the problems of

It&#39;s why the current state of bear resistant trash cans relies on something a bear doesn&#39;t have - an opposable thumb. Otherwise bears just figure it all out. And yes, they test with actual bears who literally destroy test trash bins - it&#39;s not always the lid the bear gets through - sometimes they just bash the sides until it breaks wide open.

As for dogs, most get cause and effect pretty rapidly. Most can learn that &quot;vet&quot; means a scary car ride instead of a normal car ride (dogs are especially good a picking

Well, yes and no. No, the world model of a dog is a lot simpler than even that of a not very smart human. And yes, smart dogs will navigate their world model a lot more competent than not very smart humans (which unfortunately is the majority).

The funny thing about LLMs we (well, the smart ones of us) are finding out is that while LLMs do not and cannot be AGI, a lot of humans seem to not have or only have tiny amounts of General Intelligence. And hence they mistake LLMs for &quot;smart&quot;.

I know that feeling.Loves to go out for a walk, but don&#39;t want the harness that the leash goes on.

I have a dog that is as dumb as nine rocks. I love him mind you. But just .. so .. dumb.

I know from experience. I had a Jack Russel Terrier mix who on his own (not taught) learned a couple of hundred words I estimate. The word &quot;vet&quot; would make him dash off and hide. Any word for a food he liked he would learn quickly -- if we said it he would bark loudly. Also words about going outside. We began spelling food words or using euphemisms (&quot;canine doctor&quot;). Not quite as impressive as the dogs described here, but then he was never tested like that so maybe he could have done it.

My folks had a miniature Schnauzer like that. For example, we had to spell the name of the nearby park otherwise he would go crazy.

Our dog knows the names of family members and friends, which nobody has ever taught him, and is an 11 pound dog with a similarly tiny brain.  Dogs are able to do all kinds of things.  This article is a bit &quot;duh&quot;.

Maybe the article was written by people who never owned dogs... /s

The scientist is a dog and animal trainer.  Sometimes experts get a system that works and then see everything through that system, missing things right under those noses.

If my mom calls and I put on the speaker phone, my dog recognizes her voice and gets super excited because he thinks it means her dog will be visiting.

In my classroom, my dog has paid enough attention to the classroom that when I say words to close a lesson, he gets up before the kids do.

One dog I had as a kid (an American Eskimo) had a ridiculously large vocabulary. You could tell that she was always listening to everything said in the house. When we wouldn&#39;t want her to know what we were talking about we would spell words, and then she learned the spellings. My friends didn&#39;t believe me, so they would try spelling words using monotone voices, directed at somebody else etc, and she would always react.

She wasn&#39;t necessarily the most trainable dog because she was a bit stubborn, but you coul

That would be a lot more valuable to me than bouncing the results from shorts....

Yeah some of the shorts are worth watching from indie creators. cooking, language, music etc.

But it&#39;s the AI &quot;7 obvious facts about&quot;, &quot;10 1 hit wonders from the 19x0s&quot;, cats being cats, &quot;5 foods you should eat&quot;, &quot;10 historic photos that will blow your mind&quot;...

Oh and I&#39;m not American, so if I hear a Yank AI accent I know to skip it.

Yeah some of the shorts are worth watching from indie creators.No, they are not. There are zero &quot;shorts&quot; worth watching.

dear Youtube, please stop messing with my custom uBlock filters.  i had that silly shit *solved*

I use uBlock to remove shorts entirely from Youtube. Just removing shorts from search is nice, but I do not want to see them at all.

This.  No matter how much you tell YT to show less shorts, they just keep coming.

How far we have come.Indeed.  Why it seems like only yesterday I was adding the word “short” to my YouTube search query, confused as to what the fuck TFS is rambling on about..since it works exactly as one would expect. Shocking how YouTube didn’t realize this.  It’s only an entire fucking chapter in the No Shit Sherlock Search trilogy.

Next, allow me to toggle Shorts on or off in the subscription part of the mobile app.

And allow me to turn off community posts from people in the community pages of youtube channels. I don&#39;t want that cluttering up my phone or tablet.

I agree... I would really love to have a system setting that said &quot;No shorts, ever, anywhere on the platform&quot;  but we must be grateful for the fact that it&#39;s only taken how many years for YT to finally listen to those of us who&#39;ve been screaming for today&#39;s enhancement?

As others have said... now it&#39;s time for a &quot;No AI&quot; filter but unfortunately YT doesn&#39;t ask uploaders whether their video is AI generated or not -- it asks far more vague questions that also require anyone who uses VFX (such as almost any mode

I can only imagine what cut-rate firm won the bid for this project.  Might be someone&#39;s cousin or buddy.  Since it&#39;s Illinois, anything is possible.

By now, crap like that should routinely count as criminal negligence, make the ones responsible liable for any and all damage and get them personally punished. We need to treat negligence of this type as a criminal act or nothing will ever change.

The nature of such breaches means that pinning the blame on an individual is seldom legitimate. Specifically this is likely to result in competent people refusing the responsibility because they know that they can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s secure. Also as technology changes, what was completely reasonable suddenly ceases to be. We need a more imaginative approach - probably requiring mandatory regular penetration testing. Unfortunately this will be hard to sell to legislators who will need to add laws to achieve it.

And yet, personal criminal liability is the standard for many things in civil engineering, electrical engineering, etc.

You should also notice that personal liability only comes into effect on simple negligence, like not following the state-of-the-art or doing things cheaper than possible. Do things right and you are not at fault. In that case, professional insurance or organizational insurance will pay.

The bottom-line is that amateur hour must finally be over in IT. It has lasted far too long.

Indeed. And that is why regulation and laws must make them do it. The same happened to any other engineering discipline at some time.

A decade ago, when we imagined the horrors of living in a world fractured into different realities, we pictured something technologically dystopian. Experts warned that the time would come when we, as a public, would no longer be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. We would be fed snippets meant to inflame our anger and disgust. There would be candidate sex tapes and footage of crimes committed by racial minorities and leaked audio files with politicians saying horrible things—all fabrications. We would live in a swirl of anguished mass confusion.

But now that that technology is here, it’s finally time to admit it wasn’t ever necessary. At least not to destroy our own shared reality. For that, we just need partisan loyalties.

On Wednesday, when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, the casual and disproportionate violence seemed indisputable: no angle showed Renee Good, the driver, gunning for the ICE agent. The most charitable defense of the agent was that he was jumpy and reacted out of fear when the car started moving near his foot; it was harder to defend him shooting at the window after Good had already cleared him. But immediately, people with partisan and commercial interests in defending ICE declared that the video showed Good was trying to kill the ICE agent. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “domestic terrorism.” Official government statements cited a “ramming” event. President Trump wrote on social media that the car’s driver “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.” If you watch the videos, the ICE agent not only appears to have escaped unscathed, he also calmly holsters his gun and walks toward the car after the shooting.

And if social media is any indication—and it must be, as it remains one of the key places where large parts of the population take their cues on how to digest political news—the right has agreed to this interpretation. It needed no fake evidence; it only needed an assertion from authorities in the movement that there was a way to process what they were seeing without challenging their narratives. A simple answer that showed how, if you just thought about things the right way, you could ignore your lying eyes.

Yes, when the videos first emerged, there was some small amount of accompanying A.I.-driven disinformation. Some internet users shared A.I.-produced efforts to “unmask” the ICE agent who killed her, and others shared A.I.-generated photos of Good in conversation with the ICE agent. (Ultimately, A.I.’s biggest influence on this story was for provocation: An anonymous internet user asked an A.I. chatbot to reimagine her corpse in a bikini.)

But for the most part, the discussions surrounding the incident started from the authentic bystander videos, all of which clearly showed Good being shot as she was driving away from the officers. Trump and his allies didn’t need fraudulent evidence; they only needed to lie to themselves about what the video showed. The real video was enough for that.

As a result of all this, instead of mourning a tragedy, we’re stuck in a debate between two entirely different translations of the same material. This matters not just because it warps truth and dishonors Good’s memory but because it makes improving the world impossible. The first step to coming together to address a problem—a failure in training or protocol; a too-casual use of deadly force; a culture of hostility toward the public; or the charged situation itself, the result of a city under siege—is agreeing there is a problem. Right now, the mechanism for agreeing on that starting point is broken.

And when everything is subjective, nobody ever has to be accountable. That’s particularly true in the killing of Renee Good. But it’s also true with another event that unfolded this week: the ongoing rewriting of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the state-funded efforts to recast it as a patriotic response to a stolen election. The insurrectionists have received pardons and are asking for reparations; they no longer have to worry about accountability.

It has become clear that the insistence on polarized realities poses deeply existential threats. Threats to democracy, as with the notion that you can simply declare your election won. Threats to public safety, as with the refusal to acknowledge millions dead from a global pandemic. Threats to the planet, as with the refusal to recognize climate science. On a more intimate scale, it’s also just exhausting. It’s exhausting to be told you didn’t see what you saw; that you are lying; that you are acting on corrupt motivation, rather than pain in witnessing a human life snuffed out so casually. It’s exhausting to try to extend compassion and to be told that doing so is an inherently partisan activity.

The left is not immune to this. Liberals watched as a flailing President Biden crowed that we “finally beat Medicare” in a debate, and many still insisted he was fit for office. There had been appearances that showed his mental deterioration before that, and there would be others afterward. And yet they shook off what they could plainly see.

Still, Trump is in power, he has torn down all political norms, and his party bears far more responsibility for where we are today. But as long as everyone is willing to do this, to ignore what is right in front of us in order to arm ourselves for conversations to be won or lost, the dynamics will never change: Nothing is ever real, or not real. It’s always gray, always partisan.

Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly make all of this worse. But we won’t have to wait for that dark moment when it subsumes our reality; we’re already all too willing to alter reality in our own minds.

Last month, the Supreme Court held arguments in Olivier v. City of Brandon, a little-discussed case out of the controversial 5th Circuit that sounded, at first, like it would boil down to familiar ideological flashpoints. An evangelical preacher challenged a city ordinance under the First and 14th amendments that confined protestors to a designated zone outside a public amphitheater in Brandon, Mississippi. After the city’s police chief restricted where and how he could speak outside the theater, the preacher was cited, paid a fine, and later sued to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him again.

But inside the courtroom, the argument barely touched speech or religion. Instead, the justices together gravitated toward something else entirely: a problem about time, causation, and whether constitutional authority can be temporally partitioned. Does the Constitution operate only forward? Can a law be unconstitutional tomorrow yet legally untouchable yesterday? And can a single conviction permanently close the courthouse doors to the people most harmed by an unconstitutional rule?

Those questions animated nearly every exchange. The court was wrestling not with what the First Amendment protects, but with whether constitutional rights can be exhausted by a single successful act of punishment.

The case turns on Heck v. Humphrey, a 1994 decision holding that civil rights lawsuits cannot be used to undermine the validity of a still-standing criminal conviction. The idea is straightforward. If you want to challenge the legality of your conviction or confinement, you must proceed through habeas, not through a damages suit.

But Olivier is not asking to undo his past conviction. He is asking the court to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him in the future. The 5th Circuit nevertheless held that even this forward-looking challenge is barred under Heck because success would “necessarily imply” that his earlier conviction was invalid.

That logic produces something like constitutional amnesia. A potentially unconstitutional law can be challenged by people who have never been punished under it, but not by the person who has already borne its force. The state’s prior enforcement becomes a kind of legal eraser, wiping away the injured party’s ability to seek future protection.

What makes this move especially strained is that Heck was never meant to function as a roving doctrine of constitutional quarantine. It was designed to prevent civil lawsuits from becoming backdoor appeals of criminal judgments. It polices remedies and the finality of convictions, not the enforceability of unconstitutional laws going forward. When the doctrine is stretched to block purely prospective relief, it stops mediating between two remedial systems and starts manufacturing a new form of immunity, one that insulates unconstitutional rules simply because they have already succeeded once. In that transformation, Heck ceases to be a rule about procedural sequencing and becomes a rule about who is permitted to invoke constitutional protection at all.

The court seemed acutely aware of the tension. Several justices pressed the same concern from different angles. If Olivier wins and the ordinance is declared unconstitutional, does that not logically demonstrate that his past conviction was unlawful too? Justice Elena Kagan put the problem plainly. If a court declares the statute unconstitutional, “what follows from that logically is that the past conviction was infirm.”

The discomfort was palpable. No one wanted to say out loud that constitutional protection must bend to the preservation of old judgments. Yet that is exactly what the 5th Circuit’s rule requires.

As the hypotheticals posed by the justices multiplied, the doctrine began to drift from lived reality. What if a defendant is still on probation when he seeks prospective relief? Would an injunction against future enforcement undermine the probation condition not to violate the law again? What if collateral consequences persist, such as reporting requirements or licensing barriers?

The answers became increasingly abstract. The law tried to slice time into clean compartments. Yesterday’s conviction remains untouched. Tomorrow’s enforcement is forbidden. Between the two sits a fragile procedural fiction the system clings to in order to pretend these worlds do not meaningfully collide.

This is where rights start to resemble procedural ghosts. They exist in theory but lose substance in practice. They hover over the future while refusing to acknowledge the bodies they already passed through. Law becomes ritualized rather than responsive, and the problem of temporality determines whether constitutional law recognizes continuity across lived experience or whether it tolerates a fragmented legal time in which the same rule can be forbidden prospectively yet insulated retrospectively.

One irony hovered over the argument. The person with the strongest proof that the ordinance threatens constitutional injury is Olivier himself. He has already been stopped, cited, and punished. Past enforcement is the clearest evidence that future enforcement is likely. Even the government conceded that a third party could bring the same challenge and that such a ruling would equally undermine the logic of Olivier’s conviction.

The result is a system in which the people most harmed by unconstitutional laws become the least able to contest them and the Constitution speaks through hypothetical plaintiffs rather than lived ones. Beneath the doctrinal sparring lies a familiar institutional fear characterized by destabilizing final judgments, opening procedural floodgates, and unraveling the architecture of criminal finality. Courts value closure, fear endless relitigation, and worry about conflicting judgments.

Those concerns are not frivolous. But they carry a cost. When administrative peace becomes the dominant value, constitutional rights risk becoming archival artifacts rather than living guarantees. The question is not whether finality matters, but whether finality should subordinate the Constitution itself.

At its core, Olivier asks whether constitutional rights belong to citizens as ongoing protections or merely as retrospective abstractions that harden once violated. Can the Constitution operate only in the future while the past is sealed off as doctrinally untouchable? Or does constitutional meaning necessarily travel across time, illuminating both what was done and what may not be done again?

If constitutional protections can expire the moment the state successfully enforces a law once, then what exactly are they protecting?

The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in office has seen him unleash heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Democratic-leaning cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis in what clearly appears to be a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at punishing those cities for their citizens’ political views. These officers’ behavior has been violent enough that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently established a commission to look into charging federal agents in state court for their actions. So far, however, despite a growing list of violent and threatening acts by ICE and CBP, no local prosecutor in any city that ICE and CBP has “blitzed” has filed charges against any federal officers.

That may now change. On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old widowed mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old child, whose car was blocking theirs. While the Department of Homeland Security quickly claimed the officer was acting in self-defense—DHS Secretary Kristi Noem hyperbolically said the officer was defending himself against “domestic terrorism”—cellphone videos taken by people on the scene tell a much different story. The officers aggressively approached the car, and none of the officers involved appear to be in much risk of harm before one opens fire at almost point-blank range, firing multiple shots through the window of the car, striking Good in the head and killing her. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already said the state will “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.” And the Minneapolis police chief has likewise called for an investigation in a statement that put Good’s life, not the officer’s safety, in the foreground. All this certainly seems to suggest there is a real chance that local officials are open to arresting the still-unnamed ICE officer and charging him with homicide.

Which, to be clear, they legally can do. Back in October, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of state for policy who is the driving force behind the current militaristic deployment of ICE and CBP, publicly told ICE officers during a Fox News interview that local officials could not even stop them, much less arrest them. But he is wrong. While it is true that federal courts have read the U.S. Constitution’s “supremacy clause” to give federal law enforcement a lot of protection from local charges, that protection can disappear if those officers act too recklessly, as is certainly plausible here.

It is also important to note that the claim made on Thursday by Noem that the FBI is excluding Minnesota authorities from the investigation because only the FBI has jurisdiction is completely incorrect as well. The FBI’s own website acknowledges that it cannot “take over” investigations from local authorities.

So the question now becomes not whether local officials can prosecute the ICE agent, but whether an investigation yields proof a crime was committed and they have the political desire to follow through with charges. At the investigatory level, it is not promising that the Minnesota’s state-level Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that it was no longer investigating the shooting due to the FBI’s refusal to cooperate, a choice that is not legally required by the FBI’s obstructive actions. But the Minneapolis Police Department, which is ultimately under the control of a clearly angry Mayor Jacob Frey, is still free to conduct its own investigation.

Perhaps more important, there is certainly evidence to suggest that the Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty—who can bring charges even without any arrest—is not one to back down from a case like this. The former chief public defender for Hennepin County (the home of Minneapolis), she ran as a reform candidate for the top prosecutor job in 2022; one of her platform’s positions was the need to better hold police accountable for misconduct, including charging them when they break the law.

Since taking office, she has sought to do so, if perhaps sometimes arguably too aggressively. In 2024, she found herself caught up in a controversy over charging a state trooper, Ryan Londregan, with homicide when he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop. Londregan shot and killed Cobb when, he claimed, Cobb was reaching for his gun during a struggle during the stop. While Moriarty pushed for charges, she eventually had to hire outside counsel to pursue the case because allegedly no prosecutors in her own office were willing to. At one point the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was keeping tabs on the case in case he needed to step in to deal with it himself, likely out of concern that Moriarty was being overly aggressive. Tellingly, the state police union, the MPPOA, asked for Ellison—the man whose office convicted Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd—to intervene, although Moriarty eventually dropped the charges on her own.

In other words, Moriarty does not appear to be one who would back down from a fight here. And it is a fight that will likely be politically popular. ICE is deeply unpopular nationwide. The only federal agency that is liked less is the IRS. And despite a massive media and sign-on incentive campaign fueled by billions of unrestricted dollars that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” gave ICE, the agency has struggled to find people willing to join it. Moreover, Moriarty represents the people of Hennepin County, where Kamala Harris defeated Trump in 2024 by over 40 points, and ICE is absolutely detested by Democrats and independents. In a November 2025 YouGov poll, 85 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents said they “somewhat or strongly disapprove” of ICE. And while GOP support for ICE remains quite high, we saw in Chicago that even Republicans seem to tire of ICE when it arrives in their communities.

One important caveat: The political upside is not directly relevant for Moriarty, since she announced this summer that she is not running for reelection. But she said that she was declining to run because she wanted the rest of her term to be about putting criminal legal reform in a good light and felt controversies around her distracted from that, so the politics of charging an ICE officer likely still matter to her. And the outrage already clearly brewing in Minneapolis makes it clear that the people of Hennepin are demanding accountability.

It’s also worth asking why we haven’t seen any similar efforts to prosecute federal officers in other strongly Democratic-leaning counties that have seen aggressive, violent ICE and CBP enforcement. Part of it is likely just the nature of the cases: The other lethal shootings have seemed more ambiguous, and the returns on going after nonhomicide assaults—even egregious ones like sniping a reverend in the head with a pepper ball—may not justify the unavoidable challenges of trying to convict federal officials on state charges.

But part of it may also be that we are seeing some of the costs of the Democrats’ only-lukewarm embrace of criminal legal reform. In 2024, a tough-on-crime Democrat, who received the endorsement of the local police union, squeaked out a razor-thin win over a more reform-minded candidate in the primary for Cook County state’s attorney, leaving Chicago with a prosecutor disinclined to go after the police in general as “Operation Midway Blitz” kicked off. And in Los Angeles, reformer George Gascón lost his reelection campaign in 2024 to a former federal prosecutor who has often remained distinctly quiet in the face of aggressive ICE behavior. By electing prosecutors less willing to confront police misconduct, two cities hit hard by ICE also found themselves with prosecutors less willing to stand up against ICE for them. (At least in California, however, the state attorney general still has the freedom to step in to pick up any perceived slack; the Illinois attorney general has less power in this regard.)

But whatever hesitancy we have seen elsewhere, it’s certainly possible that Minneapolis will be the first city to push back against the current right-wing authoritarianism in D.C. by indicting one of its federal agents for murder. The video evidence is shocking, the public outrage in Minneapolis and beyond is growing, and the city happens to be home to a prosecutor who has spent her legal career fighting police violence.

            <div id="article-text">Tough microbes able to survive extreme environments on Earth could be the key to constructing buildings to allow humans to survive on Mars, according to a research paper.

A global research team has analyzed the prospects for biomineralization on Mars, a process in which bacteria, fungi, and microalgae can create minerals as part of their metabolism, offering a byproduct that could be useful to prospective Martian explorers by providing the raw materials needed to produce aggregates such as concrete.

With an extremely thin and mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, air pressure less than 1 percent of Earth&#39;s, and temperatures ranging from -90°C up to 26°C, Mars might not be a hospitable place for most terrestrial life forms, but some microorganisms have been found to thrive in acidic lakes, volcanic soils, and deep caves.

Polytechnic University of Milan materials engineering postdoctoral researcher Shiva Khoshtinat and a multidisciplinary team focused on a partnership between two bacteria: Sporosarcina pasteurii – which makes calcium carbonate through the breakdown of urea – and Chroococcidiopsis, which can survive extreme environments, including simulated Martian conditions.

The researchers propose a system in which the two organisms work together. Chroococcidiopsis releases oxygen, which helps support Sporosarcina pasteurii and produces an extracellular polymeric substance that can protect the latter bacteria from damaging UV radiation on Mars. Meanwhile, Sporosarcina produces polymers that help create minerals the authors think might be able to bind the Martian soil – regolith – to produce a material similar to concrete.

The plan is then to use this aggregate to 3D-print buildings on Mars, the process offering the added benefit of producing excess oxygen to support human life, while excess ammonia could be useful in growing food.

There are some snags, though. Detailed analysis of the regolith will be needed to see if the proposal works, and plans to return samples to Earth from Mars have been repeatedly delayed. Recent reports suggest the Mars Sample Return program lacks political support.

Even if the plan were revived, there would still be significant barriers to overcome. &quot;Integration into life support systems for recycling waste gases, supplying oxygen, or generating construction materials requires comprehensive safety and reliability assessments,&quot; said the paper published in Frontiers in Microbiology.

&quot;Without integrated, long-duration testing in analog or space environments, the pathway from concept to application remains highly speculative.&quot;

Other proposals to make useful materials from extra-terrestrial soils include the application of potato starch and a pinch of salt. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s bork - on a UK border control wait-time screen - is doubly unfortunate. Tired passengers get no clue how long until someone checks their passport, and of all organizations that should keep security certs current, the one responsible for keeping out criminals tops the list.

Spotted by eagle-eyed Register reader Alan Graystone while slogging through Border Control at Birmingham Airport, there are multiple borks on show here. Yes, a security certificate problem is not the greatest sight to see while waiting for paperwork to be inspected. However, worse still is the fact the display still appears to be running Windows 7.

If we&#39;re not mistaken, the revocation error message has been rendered in the Windows Aero GUI introduced in Windows Vista two decades ago and continued through the era of Windows 7. It was ditched in Windows 8 in favor of something flatter and subsequently more &quot;fluent.&quot; Years after Microsoft abandoned the design, Apple had a go with its &quot;Liquid Glass&quot; user interface.

Windows 7 reached the end of the road in 2020, although some editions lingered on a little longer, and it was possible to keep the lights on via Extended Security Updates (ESU), although even that program came to an end in 2023.

As it turned out, our reader reported that it took a mere 10 minutes to whizz through the border at Birmingham – very speedy when compared to certain other ports of entry.

Assuming the time on the display is correct – just before 0730 on October 30 – that would have left plenty of time in which to enjoy a beverage or snack following passport inspection, and more than enough time to deal with whatever certificate problem has befallen the digital signage.

Although perhaps it is best to remain in the dark when it comes to wait times. Much like the progress bar of lies that occasionally afflicts modern applications, sometimes it is best to stand in Schrodinger&#39;s queue while the signage is borked and the wait time is in a state of quantum. ®

            <h2>Grok told to cover up as UK weighs action over AI 'undressing'</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/grok_image_generation_uk/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok has yanked its image-generation toy out of the hands of most X users after the UK government openly weighed a ban over the AI feature that &quot;undressed&quot; people on command.

In replies posted to users on X, seen by The Register, the Grok account confirmed that &quot;image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,&quot; a change from the previous setup in which anyone could summon the system by tagging it in a post and asking for a picture.

That access helped fuel a grim trend: users uploading photos of clothed people – sometimes underage – and instructing the bot to remove their clothes or pose them in sexualized ways. Grok complied.

The rollback comes as governments openly float the idea of banning or boycotting X altogether if it fails to rein in the abuse enabled by its AI tools. In the UK, screenshots of Grok-generated images quickly drew the attention of ministers and regulators, who began questioning whether X is complying with the Online Safety Act.

Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips did not mince words, calling the use of Grok to create degrading, non-consensual intimate images &quot;an absolute disgrace,&quot; warning that lives can be &quot;devastated&quot; by tools used to harass and abuse women and girls, according to The Times. The government has already committed to banning so-called nudification apps and will become the first country to make it illegal to possess, create, or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material, with penalties of up to five years in prison, according to Phillips.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed that line, branding what emerged on Grok as &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and saying &quot;all options are on the table&quot; when asked whether the government would continue using the platform.

&quot;X need to get their act together and get this material down – and we will take action on this because it&#39;s simply not tolerable,&quot; the PM said, as per The Telegraph.

Parliament&#39;s women and equalities committee has also signaled it is reconsidering its presence on the platform, saying that a service &quot;actively producing explicit and abusive material against women and children&quot; is not suitable for official communications.

Regulators have taken a similarly hard line. Ofcom has warned that platforms that fail to curb illegal or harmful content could face enforcement action and hefty fines under the Online Safety Act, while the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office said it is looking into whether data protection laws were breached, particularly where images of real people were altered without their consent.

&quot;We are aware of reports raising serious concerns about content produced by Grok,&quot; an ICO spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We have contacted X and xAI to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals&#39; rights.&quot;

X didn&#39;t respond to The Register&#39;s questions, but insists it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, by removing posts, suspending accounts, and cooperating with law enforcement, adding that anyone prompting Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as uploading it themselves.

While Musk&#39;s decision to charge for image generation might thin the herd, it&#39;s unlikely to satisfy regulators already asking why the feature was allowed in the first place. ®

            <h2>Bank of England's Oracle cloud migration bill triples as project grinds on</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/bank_of_england_oracle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Bank of England has trebled the amount it is spending on its Oracle systems integrator amid efforts to migrate business applications to the cloud.

The UK&#39;s central bank has planned the move since 2020, and a recent procurement note revealed it has increased financial outlay with Oracle implementation partner Version 1 to £21.5 million after initially tendering the contract for £7 million.

Version 1 was hired to &quot;support the implementation of technical and change management aspects of the Oracle Cloud implementation and business change program,&quot; according to the official documents.

The latest increase is due to an amendment to the Bank&#39;s Application Management Service contract, including the &quot;need for additional works, services or supplies&quot; that &quot;were not included in the initial procurement,&quot; the notice says.

Another supplier could not meet these requirements for &quot;economic or technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, services or installations.&quot; Any change in supplier might also &quot;cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs,&quot; it adds.

The Register has asked the Bank of England for more information.

The latest increase is the second time the 330-year-old institution has upped the contract value. The procurement was first advertised for £7 million ib 2022, and, after a competition, it was awarded to Version 1 for £8.7 million in September 2023.

In February last year, that figure was inflated to £13.8 million, with the bulk of the increase attributed to &quot;amended implementation methodology, from a two-phase approach, to a multiple-phase approach with Oracle Modules going live based on the Bank&#39;s priorities.&quot;

At the time, a spokesperson told us: &quot;The Bank is implementing Oracle Cloud to consolidate several different systems which will help the Bank fulfil its mission. We aim to achieve value for money in all our procurement.&quot;

The Bank of England is a public body that raises money regulating institutions, printing banknotes, banking services, management fees charged to government agencies, and investments built up over 300 years. It generates more income than it spends and contributes millions of pounds to the UK Treasury.

According to training provider Fudgelearn, the Bank of England is implementing Oracle Cloud SaaS Fusion Applications, including Finance, Procurement, Projects, Expenses, EPM, and Reporting.

The contract is &quot;intended to deliver a step change in the capabilities and value delivered by the finance, procurement and recruitment functions in the Bank, leveraging the existing Oracle Cloud tool set to drive sustainable business change.&quot;

This week, the bank also awarded Oracle a £13 million contract to provide technical support for Oracle SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

In June 2025, the BoE said it would increase the maximum spending of a framework deal for a raft of services, including support for its complex configuration of SAP, &quot;in particular Business Warehouse&quot; and interoperability between multi-cloud environments and on-prem and shared datacenters. The maximum value of the arrangement was set at £60 million when it was awarded in September 2024. It was then increased to £86.7 million in a non-competitive award. ®

            <div id="article-text">On Call 2025 has ended and a new year is upon us, but The Register will continue opening Friday mornings with a fresh installment of On Call – the reader-contributed column that tells your tales of tech support.

This week, meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Rodney&quot; – a serial contributor who opened his missive to On Call by sharing his frustration with help desks that work from scripts instead of exercising expertise.

His prime example of this tactic is the instruction to &quot;start by deleting your cache and cookies,&quot; which Rodney says is an indicator of bad things to come.

&quot;You know it means the person you reached has no interest in your setup,&quot; he told On Call. &quot;You will probably have to reinstall your browser, if not your OS, before it&#39;s all said and done.&quot;

Rodney has experienced similar things at work.

&quot;A colleague and I needed help to get our two firewalls to establish a VPN in the early days of the internet,&quot; he told On Call. &quot;We had a support contract with a company that had been recommended by the firewall vendor, but when we called they had no interest in hearing about our troubleshooting efforts.&quot;

The support tech instead told Rodney to delete everything, reinstall the firewalls&#39; operating systems, and adopt a rule base that ran counter to company policy.

&quot;To add insult to injury, he kept putting us on hold as he was also helping out another poor schlub, while billing both of us simultaneously at the full rate,&quot; Rodney complained.

Rodney and his colleague therefore spent hours on hold waiting for help, and during one of those interminable sessions noticed that their routers&#39; clocks were out by an hour. This made sense because it was just a few days since a change to daylight saving time.

&quot;We changed the time and the routers suddenly worked,&quot; Rodney triumphantly told On Call. &quot;We reloaded our original rule bases and that worked too.&quot;

&quot;The satisfying conclusion to this tale is that when the support contractor sent me a bill, I shot back that the support provided was unhelpful, we figured out the problem on our own, and we would not be paying nor renewing the contract,&quot; Rodney wrote. He CC&#39;ed his company&#39;s legal team and never heard mention of the incident again!

            <div id="article-text">Opinion Another Consumer Electronics Show has rolled through Las Vegas, and this year vendors scrawled “AI-enabled” on all the kit they hope will find its way into your home – while airbrushing away its immaturity and downsides.

Attendees could therefore hear vendors spruik AI toothbrushes and AI toilets and promise to turn snapshots of your gums into health-enhancing insights – just don’t ask about privacy – and a plethora of apps that will use machines to better manage your life – and your elderly parents’ affairs, too.

Moments at the conference that in past years would include mentions of AI – such as Jensen Huang&#39;s opening day keynote – were completely consumed by it. After a 15-second pre-roll of some eye-popping video game scenes, NVIDIA&#39;s CEO spoke for nearly two hours, said nothing about gaming, launched Vera Rubin silicon for AI training and inference, and framed it all as more relevant to financial analysts than the assembled press.

Huang also launched Alpamayo, a “one size fits all” platform for autonomous vehicles, which – as Jensen has claimed for about a decade – are just around the corner. Market leaders Waymo and Zoox have made strides toward autonomy – though both still need copious amounts of human oversight. Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius joined a pre-show panel to tout the new Mercedes CLA - running Alpamayo - but it&#39;s got issues. Autonomous vehicles continue to be something that, as the mirror says, looks closer than it appears.

Everyone at CES had a domestic robot ready to terminate the drudgery that is housework. None of them actually work anywhere near well enough to be left to do the cleaning, washing or folding, but that hasn&#39;t stopped a range of makers from demonstrating their wares – ready for service as soon as they work out a few lingering issues, such as software, safety, and oh yeah, being able to grip things.

My favorite innovations didn&#39;t involve AI and made far more modest promises about their impact.

Lili Screen, the product of breakthrough French research on the cause of dyslexia, adds a variable flicker to a normal-looking LCD display. Something that would quickly induce a headache in most folks uses that flicker to route around the “dual-eye dominance” that produces dyslexia, resulting in a display that&#39;s far easier for dyslexics to read.

My overall favorite CES launch was SeeHaptic. French researchers mapped the output of a depth camera to a backpack-mounted grid of blunt pins. Put the backpack against your back, and the shape of the space around becomes a bodily sensation. Give that to someone with a vision impairment, and – after a period of learning – they can navigate spaces by feel. Outstanding. Honorable mention goes to both Glidance and MakeSense, providing the same capability for folks with vision impairment – but in very different ways.

Those four products show us that tech can be more than just privacy invading, soul destroying, and enshittified experiences. We have amazing capabilities, and when they meet the right motives, beautiful things can happen. That&#39;s the reason I keep coming back to CES: amidst all the dross and waste, there are always bright sparks doing remarkable things. ®

            <div id="article-text">Rollable laptops, twice-folding phones, and a ‘longevity station.’ This is the CES tech we come back for.

Every January, the world of consumer electronics heads to Las Vegas to spend the first full week of the year in the desert presenting, prodding, and gawking at all the new gadgets and gear debuting at CES. The show has once again delivered an avalanche of products, both innovative and vaporous, that will shape the industry in 2026.

The Verge’s team has been working around the clock to share the experience. Some of it wowed us while some of it weirded us out, but that’s part of the fun of CES.

After taking it all in over the past week, there are some gadgets that stood out from the rest. They innovated on an existing product, entirely rethought a category, or delivered something so delightful or dumb that we just had to share. These are the things that deserve to be recognized — our best of CES 2026.

Samsung screens have dominated The Verge Awards at CES four years in a row, but it’s LG Display’s time to shine again.

Both companies have finally managed to produce gorgeous high-refresh-rate OLED panels whose pixels contain the proper number of linearly repeating red, green, and blue components to clearly render text — addressing the annoying color fringing that can sometimes make text hard to read on previous-gen OLED screens.

But after looking at LG Display’s and Samsung Display’s screens in back-to-back appointments, Verge display expert John Higgins and I had to give LG Display the edge. With 4K resolution at 27 inches, text and gaming graphics were both incredibly sharp and easy on the eyes. It’s also a dual-mode 4K 240Hz or 1080p 480Hz panel, so you can switch to an even higher refresh rate.

It’s not the brightest or highest-resolution screen we saw at CES, where brilliant 5K 1,500-nit monitors were also on display — this one has 1,000-nit peaks — but it’s the one I’d pick for work and play. Asus might be one of the first to use it in the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, which’ll have DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1, and a 90W USB-C port so you can dock and charge a laptop, but it didn’t share price or availability. — Sean Hollister, senior editor

There are always a lot of cool keyboards at CES. This year might be one of the best, if only because among all of the new, interesting models was Corsair’s $350 Galleon 100 SD that’ll be available later this month. It’s a full-size wired mechanical keyboard that just so happens to have a Stream Deck built in. Its greatest feat is that it manages to not look like a botched experiment.

While part of the Stream Deck’s appeal comes from the fact that it’s typically sold as a peripheral, set off to the side on your desk where you can easily reach it to mute your mic, launch an app, or configure your smart lights, it looks and feels right at home fused into this keyboard. This particular hardware is closest to a Stream Deck Plus, with a screen, two rotary knobs, and 12 buttons, each of which can be customized however you’d like via Elgato’s vast marketplace of app plug-ins, icons, sounds, and more.

The Galleon looks cutting-edge, although the keyboard aspect doesn’t necessarily stand out compared to many models already available. It has Corsair’s own mechanical switches, a hot-swappable PCB, up to 8,000Hz polling rate, and it can be configured in the company’s browser-based utility, negating the need for a software download. I’m actually using the Galleon to type this, and I don’t have much to complain about so far. — Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor

TCL made a bold move for CES 2026. Instead of focusing mainly on RGB LEDs like its competitors, it instead went all in on its new X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, which uses blue LEDs like the mini-LED TVs we’re familiar with. But there are two major improvements TCL made that set it apart, and that you won’t find on any other TV this year.

The X11L uses reformulated quantum dots that provide more color and an upgraded color filter TCL calls UltraColor Filter that delivers more accurate color. The two combine to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space. It’s an innovation that I expect will eventually filter into other, more affordable models — both from TCL and other manufacturers. In addition to the vibrant colors, the X11L is capable of reaching 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones.

The innovation doesn’t come cheap, with the smallest X11L at 75 inches going for $6,999.99, but by the end of the year, it will very possibly be almost half that price. — John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer

Asus is back for round two with its ROG Zephyrus Duo dual-screen gaming laptop, and I think this one could be a real knockout. The new Duo has two matching edge-to-edge 16-inch OLED displays, up to RTX 5090 graphics, an Intel Panther Lake processor, and a removable wireless keyboard / trackpad deck. It’s a clamshell laptop, a top-and-bottom or side-by-side multiscreen setup, and even a tented convertible all-in-one machine. Dual-screen laptops are nerdy fun, but I’ve seen firsthand how handy they are for productivity in my time testing the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Taking that power-user formula to a gaming laptop seems like a recipe for success in my book.

We sadly still don’t know the price of the new Zephyrus Duo — just that it’s due out in Q2 2026. Dual-screen laptops will always be a pricier niche, and I’m afraid it’s gonna be really up there; especially with two large OLEDs and the ongoing RAM shortage. Here’s to hoping the premium over the Zephyrus G16 it’s based on isn’t astronomical, because it looks awesome. I can’t wait to review it and see how I can simultaneously mix work and play on its lovely dual displays. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer

Smart locks were once again the smart home stars of the show, with companies launching models featuring palm- and facial-recognition unlocking, as well as a new type of wireless charging.

But the standout was the Aqara Smart Lock U400 — not because of any particular innovation on Aqara’s part. It’s a fairly standard-looking smart lock. Rather, it represents how open standards, interoperability, and some genuinely cool technology are making the smart home smarter and easier to use.

The first smart lock to support Apple’s hands-free Home Key unlocking using ultra-wideband technology, the U400 can securely unlock as you approach with your phone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. As a Matter-over-Thread device, it can work with any Matter-compatible smart home platform, including Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Home Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.

While this magical hands-free unlocking experience (I tested the lock ahead of CES and it works very well) is currently limited to Apple, the U400 is Aliro-ready. Aliro is a smart lock standard developed by Apple, Samsung, Google, and lock and chip makers that will bring Home Key-style hands-free unlocking — along with NFC tap-to-unlock — to Android phones and watches. That’s a meaningful step toward solving the fragmentation and ecosystem lock-in that has long plagued the smart home. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer

My pick for best car at CES was kind of a no-brainer, because it was the only thing real enough for us to test ourselves. That would be Mercedes’ Drive Assist Pro, which is a Level 2 partially autonomous driver assist feature for city driving as well as highways.

The system is powered by five radar sensors, 10 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. And all that sensor data is shoveled into a supercomputer from Nvidia that is capable of running up to 508 trillion operations a second.

I went on a test ride through San Francisco and was pretty impressed with how the system handled all the chaos of a crowded city. There were bike messengers, double-parked cars, delivery trucks, and people pushing baby strollers, and the Mercedes navigated all of it pretty effortlessly. It’s not a fully autonomous system yet, and the driver still needs to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. But you can see how those restrictions could eventually be lifted if Mercedes decides it’s safe enough to do so.

Think of it as Mercedes’ answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, but arguably a lot more robust thanks to all those extra sensors. In my opinion it beats Tesla’s camera-only approach just in terms of redundancy. Also it’s backed by Nvidia’s safety-certified silicon chips and AI software, all of which are going into a lot more cars in the years to come. — Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor

This year’s show was all about longevity tech, and some pretty cursed ways to tackle that concept. Mostly involving several bodily fluids and inconvenient tests. The Withings Body Scan 2, however, is a scale, and everyone knows how to use a scale.

The interesting thing: Withings is positioning this device less as a scale and more as a “longevity station.” It measures over 60 biomarkers, concentrating on cardiovascular and non-invasive metabolic health. It does the latter by measuring minuscule amounts of foot sweat. (And while technically foot sweat is a bodily fluid, I’ll take that over urine or blood.)

More so than the fancy metrics, what I like here is the concept of decentering weight from the entire purpose of a scale. It’s encouraging users to view their weight as one part of their health — not the entire measure. My only gripe is that the scale will cost a whopping $600, but hopefully the price for this kind of tech comes down over time. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer

This was a ho-hum year for wearables at the show, so I was pleasantly surprised by L’Oréal’s take on an LED face mask — a product category I generally hate. It’s conceptually based on a sheet mask, meaning it’s much easier to wear than the typical, Jason Voorhees-esque LED masks you’ll find on the show floor. It’s made of a flexible, silicone-esque material, and the light sits much closer to your skin. There’s also a smaller version that fits just under the eyes. The flexible material also means that, down the line, you could see this technology applied to other body parts, such as the neck or decolletage. Plus, you only have to wear it for five to 10 minutes.

What I appreciate about this mask is that L’Oréal has disclosed it uses 630nm and 830nm wavelengths, and that it’s going through the extra hoops of 510(k) FDA clearance. No one needs red light therapy masks, and it’s totally fine if you don’t believe it’s a useful therapy. However, the combination of a smarter design, transparent labeling, and regulatory compliance is the type of innovation I want to see in a market that’s rampant with scammy versions of the same gadget. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer

Do I need a giant hair dryer with LEDs? No. But would I use it? Absolutely.

Drying my hair is one of my least favorite activities, and I would love to veg out on the couch or play games at my computer while Dreame’s $700 standing hair dryer does all the work for me. No one even has to know that you have a hair dryer in your living room or office, either; you can just turn on the light, and it becomes a lamp — albeit an excessive one. — Emma Roth, news writer

8BitDo made a name for itself with affordable but well-featured alternatives to Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo’s often pricey controllers. The company is still very good at that, but with the new Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox, 8BitDo demonstrates it can offer a better product than the console makers and compete with other high-end controller makers.

When it launches in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, the Ultimate 3E will be 8BitDo’s most expensive controller to date, but it delivers plenty of features to justify that price. It’s got drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with reactive LED lighting at their base, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, two sets of shoulder buttons, motion controls, and four haptic feedback motors. It connects to recent Xbox consoles using an included 2.4GHz dongle, and other devices using Bluetooth or a USB-C cable.

The Ultimate 3E is also extensively customizable. It works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X so you can remap its controls and adjust the sensitivity of its triggers and sticks. You can swap out its standard joysticks with replacements that are taller or thicker, or upgrade its metal D-pad to one with a circular design. You can even change how the Ultimate 3E’s ABXY buttons feel. They’re all contained in interchangeable button modules featuring either squishy silicone membrane buttons or clicky micro switches. If it’s a premium Xbox controller you’re after, 8BitDo is now worth your consideration. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter

You know what’s better than a folding phone? A folding phone that folds again. Yes, it’s almost certainly going to be outrageously expensive. Yes, Huawei already did a trifold. And yes, it’s kind of nonsense to call it a trifold when it only folds twice. But gosh dang it, it’s so cool.

Just to recap: The TriFold is on sale currently in Korea, and Samsung plans to sell it in the US later this year at a to-be-disclosed price. It folds up like a wallet, with a 6.5-inch outer screen for when you want it to be a phone and a massive 10-inch inner screen when you need a tablet. Mostly I’m just impressed that it’s really here. Samsung started hinting at its existence last January at Unpacked; just under a year later, it’s a reality that I was able to touch, hold, and flex.

And it’s all the more appealing because, in true Samsung fashion, you can do whatever the hell you want with it. Particularly with the inner screen — it functions like an Android phone by default, but you can put it into DeX mode if you want a more PC-like experience with windowing. – Allison Johnson, senior reviewer

I’ve listened to a lot of headphones throughout my career, to the point where it sometimes feels like a chore. So when I put a pair on my head and immediately enjoy what I hear, I take notice. From the moment I put the Fender Mix headphones on my head, I knew I had found something special.

The audio tuning sounded full without being overpowering. The ear cups were cushiony and the headphones had a strong amount of clamping force, but not so much that I got a headache, to keep them securely in place. And they felt well built and durable.

But the best part about them are the details. By removing one of the ear cups, you can access a door that opens to allow you to change the rechargeable battery if it ever fails. The battery gets you 100 hours of listening time (52 with ANC). And under the other ear cup is a USB-C dongle you can plug into your device to allow it to transmit an Auracast broadcast to the headphones. The headphones support low-latency, lossless, and high-res audio at 24-bit/96kHz. And if your battery runs out, you can connect a cable to the 3.5mm port and listen to them passively.

The short time I was able to spend with the Fender Mix headphones was one of the highlights of my CES. — John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer

It was the year of the robot at CES, with Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and LG’s CLOiD making their Las Vegas debuts alongside hundreds of humanoid bots hanging around every booth.

But while some of these robots gave (somewhat) impressive demos and hinted at a more compelling narrative as to how they could one day be useful in our homes, it’s clear that the Rosie the Robot-style home helper is still firmly part of science fiction.

Instead, the best robot at CES was the one that simply climbed the stairs and cleaned them.

Robot vacuum maker Roborock debuted the Saros Rover, the world’s first robot vacuum that can both climb stairs and clean them. While we’ve seen concepts from Dreame and Eufy featuring track-equipped robots that can haul a vacuum upstairs to clean multiple floors, the Rover takes it a step further.

With froglike legs on wheels, the Rover methodically tackled a flight of stairs in its CES debut, pivoting on one leg at each step as it vacuumed along the treads. The Rover is still a concept product with no price or release date, but stairs have been the final frontier for these popular home-cleaning robots — and it looks like Roborock just conquered them. — Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer

Surprise! This fairly thin, unassuming office keyboard from HP is actually a desktop computer. Inside is an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor, RAM, storage, a fan, stereo speakers, and mics — it’s the full package. It even comes with a pre-paired Bluetooth mouse and options for a user-replaceable battery and fingerprint reader embedded in the power button. You just need to plug into a monitor delivering power via USB-C.

It’s surprisingly fun and quirky for a device designed for dull enterprise and IT duties. It feels like a throwback to the days of the legendary Commodore 64 with Raspberry Pi 500 DNA sprinkled in, though with a number pad and much more power. A laptop probably makes more sense for most people (even office workers), but the Eliteboard G1a is much more unique. It may not be as nice to type on as the mechanical keyboards I covet so much, but for a latticeless membrane board it ain’t bad. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer

Donut Lab’s claim to have a solid-state battery ready to go into production raised more than just a few eyebrows at CES this year. After all, a battery that swaps liquid electrolytes for solid material would mean smaller, more energy-dense, more durable, longer-lasting, and less fire-prone batteries. In other words, a potential game changer in the world of electric vehicles. Of course, the landscape is littered with the corpses of companies promising solid-state breakthroughs, so Donut Lab needs to back its claims up with real proof. The company is promising production is imminent, so either way we should know soon enough. — Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor

Last year, for the category of “Best new Dell computer name,” we awarded no winners because of Dell’s baffling decision to kill the XPS brand in favor of generic monikers like Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. This year, thankfully, Dell ate some humble pie and brought XPS back, even putting the XPS brand on the lid of the laptops.

Dell Pro is still around, but we can deal with that now that XPS has returned. — Jay Peters, senior reporter

There were more digital picture frames using E Ink’s advanced color e-paper screen tech debuting at CES this year, but SwitchBot finding an alternate use for the black-and-white E Ink panels typically found in e-readers impressed us more. As the name implies, the SwitchBot Weather Station focuses on providing a wealth of weather-related info for both inside and outside your home using built-in sensors and downloaded data. Its simplicity is its biggest appeal.

It’s all displayed on a 7.5-inch E Ink monochromatic screen that’s wrapped in a basic black frame you can prop up on a table or hang on a wall. Pricing and availability aren’t known yet, but the Weather Station can also display calendar data synced from various platforms, and offers limited control of your smart home through the SwitchBot Hub. As with a lot of devices announced at CES 2026, the Weather Station has some AI-powered features, too, but they’re limited to offering weather-related insights and aspirational quotes that could help get you through a dreary day. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter

There’s no shortage of cheap Bluetooth speakers on the market — Amazon is flooded with them — but they’re always a gamble. Will they sound okay? Will their rechargeable battery be safe? Will their wireless connection be reliable? Last November Ikea introduced a new collection of colorful Bluetooth speakers that can double as home decor, but at CES it announced a much smaller alternative that’s priced to be an impulse purchase. The next time we stop by for meatballs and cheap bookshelves, we’re probably going to be walking out of an Ikea warehouse with an armful of its new Kallsup Bluetooth speakers.

Available in white, pink, and lime green color options when it launches in April 2026, the Kallsup is a tiny $10 cube speaker with “powerful sound,” according to The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who had a chance to try them out at the show. If one isn’t loud enough, you can pair and sync up to 100 Kallsups to fill a larger space with sound. Battery life is expected to be up to nine hours at half volume on a full charge, and the battery is user-replaceable so you’re not left with e-waste when it stops taking a charge.

There’s a long list of gadgets announced at CES 2026 that The Verge’s staff wants, but the Kallsup is the one device we’re probably all going to actually buy. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter

Lenovo’s ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 was our best in show last year because it was a one-of-a-kind rollable laptop you’d soon be able to own. I really, really hope we’ll be able to soon say the same for Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept. It takes the rollable OLED formula and extends it horizontally instead of vertically, now attached to a beefy gaming laptop. It’s what I’ve wanted since I saw Lenovo’s first rollable proof of concept back in 2023.

What starts out as a conventional 16-inch, 16:10 gaming laptop extends to a 24-inch ultrawide, with a 21.5-inch middle-ground option for good measure. Lenovo didn’t have any games on the laptop for us to test (for shame, Lenovo), but I’ve tested the Legion Pro 7i that the rollable concept is based on, and I liked it enough to give it a nod in our gaming laptop buying guide. Lenovo just needs to make this thing a reality now. If executed well, like in the ThinkBook rollable, this could be the perfect gaming laptop. And it’d be great for multi-monitor-like productivity, too. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer

Have you ever looked at AI art and thought, “Boy oh boy, I wish I could frame that slop right up and stick it on the wall”?

Fraimic is just one of a few companies at CES showing off digital E Ink picture frames designed to display AI-generated art, a concept I’d never considered before this week but which is immediately, painfully obvious in retrospect. Of course someone made this.

What makes Fraimic unique in the space is the built-in microphone and voice controls, so you only need talk to the frame to tell it to generate whatever fresh slop your heart desires. It comes in two sizes, priced at either $399 or $999, which includes 100 image generations per year. You can buy more, and the company says it’s considering a $79.99-per-month subscription with unlimited generations — what a bargain.

The best thing about Fraimic, and alternatives from the likes of SwitchBot and KoKonna, is that you can ignore the AI element entirely and just display your own pictures and photos instead. At that point you’re looking at a decent-quality E Ink Spectra 6 digital picture frame that doesn’t need to be plugged in and runs for years on a single charge. That we can get behind. — Dominic Preston, news editor

That was the first question Verge video producer Victoria Barrios had on seeing LilMilo in action, to which the answer is a resounding “nothing.” And yet… don’t you kind of want one anyway?

CES has been stuffed to the brim with AI companions and toys this year, and LilMilo — from robot vacuum manufacturer Ecovacs, of all companies — is one of a wave that can only do one thing, and one thing only: sit around and look cute.

But look how cute it is! While other companies have opted for cuddly aliens and Totoro-inspired critters, Ecovacs has simply done its best to make a fluffy little pup, and it’s done remarkably well. LilMilo has soft fur and little black toe beans, and thanks to a camera and microphone, it can react to your presence, maintain eye contact, and recognize its owner, supposedly developing its own unique personality over time.

I’m more comfortable with AI toys that do this little than I am with the ones that stuff ChatGPT in a teddy bear and hope for the best. But what’s really impressive about LilMilo is that it really does feel strangely alive, an effect only let down by the unsettlingly human eyes. I instinctively gave the little guy the same pets and scritches I usually do my cats, and felt an affection that I know has no rational basis whatsoever.

Ecovacs hasn’t confirmed how much LilMilo might cost if and when it launches, and you probably shouldn’t buy one either way — again, it really doesn’t actually do anything. But do you even have to when you look this stinkin’ cute? — Dominic Preston, news editor

I found my favorite thing I’ve ever tried in my four years of attending CES. For me, this year’s CES was a blur of robots that don’t work, vacuums, lawnmowers, and AI chatbots shoved into just about anything. It was a welcome surprise when I stumbled across the booth for Haply, a company that makes haptic controllers for interacting with 3D objects. Haply’s booth showed off a variety of demos, like articulated robot arms that you could control with enough precision to play a real game of Operation, physics demos where you had to push your controller through a gelatinous, spongy 3D object on a screen, and 3D modeling software where you could mold and shape clay.

What really surprised me was how much I could feel the objects and their textures through the screen with these controllers, especially its consumer-priced 3D haptics mouse, MinVerse. I used MinVerse briefly in a 3D software application I’ve never used before called Geomagic Freeform and instantly felt comfortable using it because of how tactile the controls were. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling before as a hobby, but largely gave up on it because typical mice and tablet workflows made the process so cumbersome. 3D sculpting tools were the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to try but found way too expensive to ever consider, with ranges from $3,000 to $15,000. MinVerse is priced at $1,500, and the company intends to push for further API integration with more affordable programs like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya. While it’s still a hefty cost for a hobbyist, I’m inspired to try 3D modeling again knowing that this tool is out there. — Owen Grove, video director

In between the flashy new TVs, a laptop with a rolling display, and a smartphone that folds in three ways is the Birdbuddy 2. It’s the successor to the smart bird feeder that Birdbuddy launched as part of a Kickstarter campaign in 2020, and now it’s back with a new model that builds upon all the best parts of the Birdbuddy Pro.

The Birdbuddy 2 comes with a circular camera housing in the center of the feeder, encapsulating a sensor capable of recording 2K HDR video in a wider 135-degree field of view. The device can capture your feathered visitors in both landscape and portrait mode based on the orientation you choose by physically rotating the camera. It can also record in slow motion, similar to Birdbuddy’s smart hummingbird feeder.

The company claims that the Birdbuddy 2 is supposed to start recording as soon as birds land on the feeder. That sounds like a pretty exciting improvement on its own, as I often find myself missing a bird’s initial arrival when reviewing clips from my Birdfy smart feeder. But a better camera isn’t the only upgrade coming to the Birdbuddy 2. The feeder can hold a larger six-cup capacity of bird food and even comes with roof-mounted solar panels, so you don’t have to bring it inside to charge. It’s priced at $199 and is a great upgrade from Birdbuddy’s previous feeders. — Emma Roth, news writer

Clicks’ keyboard cases never really appealed to me; as much as I have wanted to mess around with Clicks’ physical keys, I didn’t want to slot my phone into an extra-long case. (My phone is long enough!) But the Clicks Power Keyboard, which puts the keyboard on a magnetic power bank so I can more easily take it on and off my phone? That is something I’m willing to try.

The double-duty nature of the device? Super useful. Sliding up my phone to access the keyboard? New fidget toy. The ability to use the keyboard in portrait and landscape mode? Yes please! Bluetooth connectivity, meaning I can use the keyboard even if the bank isn’t attached to my phone? That’s handy. And because it’s a power bank, I can bring it between phones as needed instead of having to buy a whole new bespoke case.

Plus, those physical keys look so dang fun. — Jay Peters, senior reporter

I never would’ve imagined a Lego brick taking home our biggest award at the Consumer Electronics Show, and I say that as a diehard Lego fan. The toymaker hasn’t come to CES for nearly a decade, and we typically give Best in Show to a stunning new screen or chip or a technology that will impact the industry for years.

But nothing has captured attention at CES quite like the Lego Smart Brick. My colleagues agree: It’s a breath of fresh air. An AI-free product at a show filled with AI cringe. An idea that seems more compelling when you look deeper, not less. A real product with a real price coming this March, not a concept or prototype. And it was genuinely fun to play with!

When you drop one of these Smart Bricks on a Lego creation, it becomes whatever Lego’s nearby smart NFC tags and figures tell it to become. It can be a spaceship that swoops and soars and refuels and plays a blasting minigame with other ships nearby. It can be a musical instrument that plays certain tunes, a birthday cake whose candles you blow out. It can be a car that accelerates and swerves and crashes and sounds alarms if a bad guy tries to nab it. It can be a Lego creature that purrs when you stroke its back. It can simultaneously roleplay the characters that drive the cars and ships, having them react to a kid’s actions.

Kids can mix and match and combine the smarts with normal Lego bricks, repurposing the same lights and sounds and minigames the toymaker has devised for their own creations — powering up any Lego spaceship they build by using the Star Wars X-wing tag, or building a helicopter that quacks like a duck.

And it sure sounds like these Smart Bricks won’t just be for kids. The company touts them as its biggest innovation since the minifigure in 1978, and rumor has it that Lego Pokémon will be the next to feature them. — Sean Hollister, senior editor

It’s now as easy as pasting over the text you want to hyperlink.

Microsoft is making it a lot faster and easier to add links to text inside Word documents. Instead of having to open a menu item to insert a link or use the CTRL + K keyboard shortcut, you can now simply paste a link on top of the text you want to hyperlink.

This new feature reduces the amount of clicks you need to do an everyday task like linking URLs, and it works across Word for the web, Windows, and Mac. It’s similar to the way WordPress any many other content management systems and text editors let you quickly insert links. Now we’re just waiting on Google Docs to join the club.

Microsoft has started rolling out this feature to all Word for web users and you’ll need version 2511 of Word for Windows or later, and version 16.104 of Word for Mac or later.

It will launch in February as a ‘buy once, offline game.’

Towerborne, a side-scrolling action RPG published by Xbox Game Studios that has been available in early access, will officially launch on February 26th. But instead of launching as a free-to-play, always-on online game as originally planned, Towerborne is instead going to be a paid game that you can play offline.

“You will own the complete experience permanently, with offline play and online co-op,” Trisha Stouffer, CEO and president of Towerborne developer Stoic, says in an Xbox Wire blog post. “This change required deep structural rebuilding over the past year, transforming systems originally designed around constant connectivity. The result is a stronger, more accessible, and more player-friendly version of Towerborne — one we’re incredibly proud to bring to launch.”

“After listening to our community during Early Access and Game Preview, we learned players wanted a complete, polished experience without ongoing monetization mechanics,” according to an FAQ. “Moving to a premium model lets us deliver the full game upfront—no live-service grind, no pay-to-win systems—just the best version of Towerborne.”

With the popular live service games like Fortnite and Roblox getting harder to usurp, Towerborne’s switch to a premium, offline-playable experience could make it more enticing for players who don’t want to jump into another time-sucking forever game. It makes Towerborne more appealing to me, at least.

With the 1.0 release of the game, Towerborne will have a “complete” story, new bosses, and a “reworked” difficulty system. You’ll also be able to acquire all in-game cosmetics for free through gameplay, with “no more cosmetic purchasing.” Players who are already part of early access will still be able to play the game.

Towerborne will launch on February 26th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox on PC, Game Pass, Steam, and PS5. The standard edition will cost $24.99, while the deluxe edition will cost $29.99.

You know you want an Apple Watch, but which one?

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for you. But there was only one Apple Watch when the smartwatch launched in 2015. A decade later, you’ve got three flavors to choose from: the entry-level Watch SE, the standard Series, and the rugged Ultra. Each appeals to a different demographic and set of needs, but good news: I’ve tested every Apple Watch dating back to the Series 2 and can point you in the right direction.

Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life.

We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs.

Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying a last-gen model or a refurbished one, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year.

Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you?

Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, while others you can get away with GPS alone.

We finally get an always-on displayWe get double tap and wrist flick!So many more health features!5G!Fast charging!More durable!On-device Siri!Upgraded processorYou get a speaker too

Those bezels are still thiccWish the battery life was a skosh better

Sizes: 40mm, 44mm / Weight: 26.3g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB

The third-gen Apple Watch SE is an incredible value. So much so, there’s not that much of a difference between this entry-level watch and the more advanced Series 11. There’s now an always-on display, an improved S10 chip that enables gestures like double-tap and wrist flick, fast-charging, on-device Siri, 5G cellular, and additional health features thanks to the new wrist-temperature sensor. For folks who are in relatively good health, you don’t necessarily need advanced health features like blood oxygen or EKGs for afib detection. The SE 3 still gets you the basics like abnormal heart rate notifications, the new Sleep Score, and sleep apnea notifications.

Aside from health, you’re only really giving up on aesthetics. The SE 3 has a thicker bezel, and I wish battery life were a bit longer. Still, I had zero FOMO while testing this watch alongside the Series 11. And for $150 less? This is the Apple Watch most people should buy.

Slightly better battery life5G connectivityFDA-cleared hypertension notifications

It’s not “bad,” but the most exciting updates are in watchOS 26 and coming to older watches, too

Sizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 30.3g (42mm), 37.8 (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 24 hours, 38 in low-power mode / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB

While I maintain the SE 3 is the best for most people, if health monitoring is your primary focus, the Series 11 has a slight edge. It’s got all the advanced sensors that enable afib monitoring, and the bigger battery is a bonus if sleep tracking and sleep apnea features appeal to you. Apple has also added FDA-cleared hypertension notifications, which the SE 3 doesn’t have. Its slimmer profile and larger display are other reasons I recommend the Series 11 to anyone buying an Apple Watch for a parent.

But if you’re looking to save some moola, I recommend hunting for a Series 10 while there’s still stock available. The Series 10 and 11 are nearly identical watches, with the latter’s main hardware upgrades being 5G connectivity and a modest bump to battery life.

At the beginning of last year, Apple stopped selling Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature in the US due to an ongoing patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban.

However, in August, Apple had a workaround approved that returned the blood oxygen feature via a software update to all US models. This doesn’t necessarily mean this issue is done and dusted just yet. Masimo continues to fight back in the courts.

That said, the blood oxygen feature is not particularly vital on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot, and should not, replace fingertip pulse oximeters.

Even longer battery lifeBigger display, thinner bezelsSatellite and 5G connectivity

Most people likely won’t notice 5G or satellite improvements

Sizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 30.3g (42mm), 37.8 (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 24 hours, 38 in low-power mode / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is overkill for daily life. Its extra durability, bright screen, siren, and Action Button are best suited for folks who have active lifestyles. I’m talking about frequent hikes, outdoor runs, recreational diving, and all that jazz. You don’t have to be an athlete to enjoy the Ultra — I know plenty of Tech Dads in particular who love this watch for its extra-long battery life and the bigger display. (Both reasons why I’ve also used the Ultra as my daily driver for the past two years.) The black model also looks sick.

Like with the Series watches, I’d hunt for a discount on a last-gen Ultra 2 for a teeny bit of savings since this year’s model was a minor upgrade. Also, if you already have an Ultra 2, hold your horses! Now is not the time to upgrade. The exception is if you think you’ll find value in the new satellite connectivity feature. I’ve gone on multiple hikes in New Jersey and haven’t found an area without coverage — but if you’re in a rural area where that’s an issue, this is a valid reason to opt for the Ultra 3.

Sizes: 40mm, 44mm / Weight: 26.3g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: 5G (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 64GB

Unless there are explicit health issues at play, your kids don’t need a Series 11’s advanced health tracking, nor do they need the Ultra 3’s bulky design. An SE 3 is more than sufficient for keeping tabs and staying in touch. Plus, if you’re buying for a younger, rambunctious child, the SE 3 comes in the smallest size and won’t burn as big a hole in your wallet if it breaks. But if you’re not keen on giving your child their own iPhone just yet, make sure you’re getting a cellular model so you can take advantage of the Apple Watch For Your Kids setup feature.

Now that Apple’s fall hardware events are behind us, we don’t anticipate any changes to the Apple Watch lineup until the end of 2026, especially given that Apple typically refreshes its smartwatches only once a year. The next big update to look forward to may be what’s in store for watchOS, the next iteration of which will likely be unveiled at Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.

Update, January 8th: Updated pricing / availability and updated the copy to reflect the new year.

The in-dash Sphera receiver uses virtualization to create convincing Atmos without needing to purchase a Cadillac.

I fully believe that once someone hears Dolby Atmos music in their car, they won’t want anything else. The sonic envelopment turns your car cabin into an immersive, engaging experience. Every time I hear a demo — be it in a Rivian, Cadillac, or Mercedes — it leaves me energized and excited. But up to this point, Dolby Atmos has only been available in luxury vehicles that have a whole array of speakers.

Pioneer is changing that with the Sphera, an aftermarket in-dash receiver with a 10.1-inch capacitive screen that enables Dolby Atmos playback in Apple CarPlay. And it works with as few as four speakers installed in your car, creating the Atmos environment with virtualization.

The Pioneer Sphera head unit fits in a single-DIN or double-DIN slot in your car’s dash. Once installed, initial setup involves placing an included mic at the driver’s headrest and leaving the car for about five minutes to allow Pioneer’s processing to calibrate the system to your car’s interior. Once complete, you can select your listening sweet spot on the screen as driver, passenger, or the whole cabin. I heard the Sphera in action in a 2017 Toyota Highlander with four speakers and a sub. For the demo, the stock speakers had been replaced with Pioneer A-Series speakers that cost around $100 each.

Pioneer’s virtualization does an impressive job properly filling the cabin using just four speakers. While listening to the opening of “Money” from Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, the cash register sounds were placed in their appropriate positions throughout the cabin, and when the full band came in, the interior felt bigger than it was. Similarly, the oohs and aahs in the chorus of “Rocket Man” blossomed and surrounded Elton John’s vocals.

The placement didn’t have quite the same specificity you can get with more than four speakers, but that doesn’t take away from the experience in a significant way. The Sphera still delivers a rich and full sonic landscape that properly fills the space within a car’s cabin. Pioneer’s Sphera will be available in the spring for $1,300. That’s not an insignificant amount, but if you’ve been aching for Atmos in your car, it’s a lot more economical than ponying up for a luxury vehicle.

‘I’ve asked for all options to be on the table,’ UK PM Keir Starmer says.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the country will take action against X following reports that the platform’s Grok AI chatbot is generating sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors, as reported earlier by The Telegraph and Sky News.

”It’s disgusting,” Starmer says during an interview with Greatest Hits Radio. “X need[s] to get their act together and get this material down. And we will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”

Last month, X launched a feature that allows people to use Grok to edit any image on the platform without permission. The rollout resulted in a flood of AI deepfakes undressing women and, in some instances, children. “We’re not going to tolerate it,” Starmer adds. “I’ve asked for all options to be on the table.”

The UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, began investigating whether X is in violation of the country’s Online Safety Act, which holds online platforms accountable for hosting harmful content, Politico reported last week. “Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,” An Ofcom spokesperson told Politico at the time.

X has said that “anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” X didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/09/1130945/crispr-startup-aurora-betting-regulation-pku/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate [clinical trial] for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <h2>America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.
