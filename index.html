            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/epa-makes-it-harder-for-states-tribes-to-block-pipelines/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed a new rule aimed at speeding up and streamlining the permitting process for large energy and infrastructure projects, including oil and gas pipelines and facilities tied to artificial intelligence.

The rule, which does not require action by Congress, includes a suite of procedural changes to section 401 of the Clean Water Act—a law enacted in the 1970s that is the primary federal statute governing water pollution in the United States.

For decades, section 401 has granted states and tribes the authority to approve, impose conditions on, or reject, federal permits for projects that they determine will pollute or damage local waterways.

Now, the Trump administration aims to scale back that authority in order to expedite projects and “unleash energy dominance,” said Jess Kramer, EPA assistant administrator for water, in a press briefing. “This proposed rule is the next step in ensuring that states and tribes only utilize section 401 for its statutory purpose to protect water quality and not as a weapon to shut down projects.”

To date, Kramer said, section 401 has allowed major energy projects to stall unnecessarily, calling the current system “fundamentally flawed.” Implementation problems, she said, have led to lengthy certification timelines that are “bad for business.”

The new rule lays out a series of procedural changes that agency officials say are designed to make the permitting process more predictable and efficient. It would create a standardized list of items companies must submit before a state or tribe can begin reviewing a project. “When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,” Kramer said. It would also prohibit regulators from asking applicants to withdraw and resubmit requests in order to extend deadlines and would reinforce a firm one-year limit for making decisions.

But in addition to making the process more streamlined, it is also restricting states and tribes, said Jon Devine, director of freshwater ecosystems at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“This is an effort to curtail the role of state and tribal water pollution control officials in looking at the impacts of federally permitted projects,” Devine said.

Under the proposal, states and authorized tribes would be limited to reviewing only the direct water-quality impacts of a project’s discharges into federally protected waters and would no longer be able to consider broader water-quality effects caused by the project as a whole, said Nancy Stoner, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based nonprofit that defends environmental and public health in the Midwest.

That shift could weaken oversight of projects such as dams, she said, noting that water released from a dam may meet quality standards while the structure itself blocks fish migration and disrupts river flows—impacts the Supreme Court has previously ruled that states may consider when making certification decisions.

Stoner also warned the proposal would further limit state authority to waters still covered by the Clean Water Act, a shrinking category after the Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett decision and later efforts by EPA and the Army Corps to narrow which waterways qualify for federal protection.

As a result, states could lose the ability to use Section 401 to protect many smaller streams, wetlands, and headwaters within their borders, leaving state regulators powerless to block, or place conditions on, federally permitted projects that could damage those waters, even if they are vital to local drinking water supplies, fisheries, recreation, or flood control.

Kramer, from the EPA, said the proposed rule is intended to curb what the agency views as misuse of Section 401 by some states to block projects for reasons unrelated to water quality.

Kramer said the changes would ensure that section 401 “is not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes, as opposed to protecting water quality.”

State officials, particularly in Democrat-led states, have relied on Section 401 in recent years to deny or place conditions on permits for major projects they say would have harmed local waterways.

In 2017, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and the state’s Department of Ecology relied on Section 401 to reject a critical water-quality certification for a proposed coal export terminal in Longview. State officials concluded the project would cause significant environmental harm that could not be mitigated. Courts later upheld the decision, and the ruling ultimately brought the project to an end.

In 2020, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo used section 401 to deny a permit for a natural gas pipeline proposed to bring fuel from Pennsylvania into the state, citing concerns that its construction would cause significant harm to water quality.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has since approved a permit for the same pipeline project Cuomo denied.

Last summer, EPA hosted two public webinars to solicit input on proposed changes to the law.

At least 14 of the speakers who joined these sessions pointed to the Clean Water Act’s long track record of improving water quality and said section 401 has been essential for protecting rivers and aquatic ecosystems from pollution, according to an EPA summary of the discussions.

The summary states: “Many of these speakers expressed concern that a new rule would weaken State and Tribal authority, arguing that such changes could undermine public health, environmental protection, and local economies.”

Soon, the agency plans to open a 30-day public comment period. After its review, Kramer said the agency would work toward issuing a final rule this spring.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like any industry that’s led by designers, the automotive world is subject to trends and fashions. Often, these are things the rest of us complain about. Wheels that used to be 16 inches are now 20s, because the extra size makes the vehicle they’re fitted to look smaller, particularly if it’s an SUV with a slab of electric vehicle battery to conceal. Front seat passengers now find themselves with their own infotainment screen, often with some kind of active filter tech to prevent the driver from being distracted by whatever it is they’re doing. And of course le buzz du jour, AI, is being crammed in here, there, and everywhere.

But the thing about fashion and trends is that they don’t remain in style for ever. For a few years, it was hard to drive a new car that didn’t use piano black trim all over the interior. The shiny black plastic surfaces hide infotainment screens well when the display is not turned on, but they scratch and show every speck of dust and lint and every smudge and fingerprint. And that’s true for the cheap econobox to the plush luxobarge. The industry finally cottoned on to this, and “black gloss has had its time—we can do without it,” Kia designer Jochen Paesen told me a few years ago.

Many of those design trends may have been annoying, but the switch away from buttons isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s affecting safety. And increasingly, safety regulators are pushing back. A couple of years ago, we learned that the Euro New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) organization that crash tests cars for European consumers decided that from 2026, it would start deducting points for basic controls that weren’t separate, physical controls that the driver can easily operate without taking their eyes off the road. And now ANCAP, which provides similar crash testing for Australia and New Zealand, has done the same.

It’s helpful to know that the lack of physical buttons isn’t just a trend pushed by designers—the bean counters like it, too. It’s quicker—and therefore cheaper—during assembly to just fit a capacitive touch module that controls multiple settings or switches than it is to have individual buttons, each connected to a wiring loom. Which is why we’re seeing the controls for heating and cooling the interior, the headlights, seat heaters, and more move from knobs and dials and sliders and buttons to touch panels. Sometimes they’re standalone, sometimes they’re embedded along the bezels of the infotainment touchscreen. Sometimes they’re even their own touchscreen.

And they’re more distracting to use than physical buttons.

Like Euro NCAP, ANCAP is not requiring all functions to be physical buttons, lest all our cars look like the flight deck of a Boeing 747-400, or perhaps a first-generation Porsche Panamera. That won’t go nearly far enough for some, but it is at least a move in the right direction.

“From 2026, we’re asking car makers to either offer physical buttons for important driver controls like the horn, indicators, hazard lights, windscreen wipers and headlights, or dedicate a fixed portion of the cabin display screen to these primary driving functions,” it wrote in its guidance of what’s changed for 2026. Similarly, Europe is requiring turn signals, hazard lights, windshield wipers, the horn, and any SOS features like the EU’s eCall function.

Encouragingly, it looks like automakers are starting to take this to heart and are designing newer models accordingly. Porsche was an early ditcher of buttons after having previously used many, many of them (like the aforementioned Panamera), but as we found in our preview of the next Cayenne, real buttons are back on the menu.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last year, we drove BMW’s new iX3. It’s the first of a series of electric BMWs to use a newly developed platform, known as the “Neue Klasse.” Later this year, we’ll see the first fully electric version of the 3 Series when the i3 sedan debuts. And next year, BMW enthusiasts will finally find out what the brand’s M division—which infuses motorsport into the vehicles like few others—can do with an EV.

There have been M-tuned EVs before now, more powerful variants of the i4, iX, and i7. And each time we’ve driven them, BMW has been at pains to point out that these weren’t true M cars, not like the M3 or M5. Honestly, they weren’t better than the cheaper, less powerful versions, something that won’t be allowed for next year’s performance EV, which might be called something like the iM3, assuming the naming convention remains logic-based.

“The next generation of models are set to establish a new benchmark in the high-performance vehicle segment,” says Franciscus van Meel, managing director of BMW M GmbH. “With the latest generation of Neue Klasse technology, we are taking the BMW M driving experience to a new level and will inspire our customers with outstanding, racetrack-ready driving dynamics for everyday use.”

Technology is the key to distinguishing the M EV from its more sedate siblings. The Neue Klasse platform hews to the software-defined vehicle trend, where a handful of powerful computers each control a wide array of functions, rather than dozens or hundreds of discrete electronic control units in black boxes each doing a single job. One computer handles infotainment, and another deals with automated driving and active safety systems. A third handles the relatively mundane but no less important job of climate control, plus the seats and doors and windows.

However, the important one here is called the Heart of Joy, which runs M-specific software, called BMW M Dynamic Performance Control. This offers an order of magnitude faster response in terms of the car’s electronic dynamic control compared to current M models, which is put to good use controlling the four electric motors that will propel the electric M.

BMW M has made M-specific front and rear drive units, each with a motor for each wheel arranged in parallel, with a gearbox on each side. On top of each drive unit are the power electronics that control it all. BMW was a little cagey with details when it briefed us on the electric M powertrain in Spain last November and wouldn’t elaborate on what kind of electric motor it’s using in the M drive units, but we suspect they’re permanent synchronous motors.

There’s also an M-specific high-voltage battery. Expect at least 100 kWh; the stock pack has 108.7 kWh net, but the cylindrical cells have been optimized for power delivery, and there’s new two-sided cooling and even a different cell layout within the pack. The cells look the same, according to Philip Guerrero, project lead for high-voltage batteries at BMW, but they have lower internal resistance and increased power density, despite using the same cell chemistry.

A performance EV with lightning-fast but precise control of each wheel does indeed sound tantalizing, and BMW told us it’s aiming at a new benchmark in driving dynamics on track as well as on the road. And it’s taking a page out of Hyundai’s book with the addition of a simulated gearshift mode. As we’ve seen in the Ioniq 5 N, using steering wheel paddles to alter the pedal mapping for lift-off regenerative braking and the throttle goes a long way to adding some engagement to a performance EV by replicating a transmission, especially if you implement it in a way that even lets you bounce off a “rev limiter” for more fidelity. For the people who think that sounds like no fun, take heart in the fact that as always, you can just choose not to turn that function on.

As we’ve noted in the past, the Neue Klasse is BMW’s most sustainable platform ever, and that, too, carries through to the M Neue Klasse. Instead of carbon fiber, it’s switching to a natural fiber alternative called Bcomp that emits 40 percent less carbon dioxide during the production process, while still offering a great strength-to-weight ratio.</div>

            <h2>The RAM shortage’s silver lining: Less talk about “AI PCs”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/the-ram-shortages-silver-lining-less-talk-about-ai-pcs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">RAM prices have soared, which is bad news for people interested in buying, building, or upgrading a computer this year, but it’s likely good news for people exasperated by talk of so-called AI PCs.

As Ars Technica has reported, the growing demands of data centers, fueled by the AI boom, have led to a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips, driving prices to skyrocket.

In an announcement today, Ben Yeh, principal analyst at technology research firm Omdia, said that in 2025, “mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers.”

Overall, global PC shipments increased in 2025, according to Omdia, (which pegged growth at 9.2 percent compared to 2024), and IDC, (which today reported 9.6 percent growth), but analysts expect PC sales to be more tumultuous in 2026.

“The year ahead is shaping up to be extremely volatile,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research VP with IDC’s worldwide mobile device trackers, said in a statement.

Both analyst firms expect PC makers to manage the RAM shortage by raising prices and by releasing computers with lower memory specs. IDC expects price hikes of 15 to 20 percent and for PC RAM specs to “be lowered on average to preserve memory inventory on hand,” Bouchard said. Omdia’s Yeh expects “leaner mid to low-tier configurations to protect margins.”

“These RAM shortages will last beyond just 2026, and the cost-conscious part of the market is the one that will be most impacted,” Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC, told Ars via email.

IDC expects vendors to “prioritize midrange and premium systems to offset higher component costs, especially memory.”

The increased costs have implications for the concept of “AI PCs,” a term OEMs have used consistently over the last two years as they sought to leverage the growth of generative AI chatbots to drive computer sales.

Shoppers, however, have been either too reluctant or too savvy to buy into manufacturer-made AI PC hype.

“PC OEMs had trouble selling the on-device AI message even before the memory shortages,” Ubrani said.

IT buyers will likely also consider local AI capabilities a lower priority if OEMs lower RAM specs to address the component shortage.

“General interest in AI PCs has been wavering for a while, since cloud-based options are widely available and the use cases for on-device AI have been limited. This indifference (between on-device and cloud-based) from a demand perspective might work in favor of PC OEMs, as they don’t need to provide large amounts of RAM,” Ubrani said.

With RAM pricing stability possibly not arriving until 2027, per Ubrani, it may be a while until RAM is readily available enough for it to make sense for PC companies to put as much emphasis on AI PCs, which generally require at least 16GB of memory, as they have in the past two years.

We’ve already seen a shift from AI PCs from Dell. In 2025, it discontinued its XPS brand of consumer laptops and desktops, partially due to the belief that “the AI PC market is quickly evolving,” Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, told media outlets at the time.

“Everyone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity,” he said.

At CES 2026, however, Dell resurrected the XPS brand and reframed its laptop marketing around build, battery life, and display quality. Terwilliger also sang a different tune.

“… what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” Terwilliger said at a press briefing ahead of the show. “In fact, I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

Microsoft also seems aware of the shortcomings of AI PCs. In December, The Information reported that CEO Satya Nadella had sent an email to engineering heads expressing disappointment with the consumer version of Copilot. He reportedly wrote that tools for connecting Copilot with Outlook and Gmail “for [the] most part don’t really work” and are “not smart.” The publication also reported that Nadella delegated some of his responsibilities to spend more time on Copilot. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report.

With that in mind, it stands to reason that we’re far from hearing the last about AI PCs. Currently, there are still plenty of stakeholders pushing AI PCs in 2026. But as we all await the end of the RAM shortage, it seems that at least some brands will attempt to build AI PCs with a significant and relevant purpose and scale back on trying to get people to buy a computer that can handle AI.

The idea of AI PCs isn’t inherently a bad thing. But in recent years, it felt like technology companies were exploiting generative AI to convince people and companies to buy more or more powerful devices, even if they didn’t need them or local AI processing.

Now, with a RAM crunch and lack of customer demand, there’s hope for AI PC marketing spiel to relent somewhat and for PC companies to try harder to prove that AI PCs are a solution to a problem, not a solution searching for a problem.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen framework that infects Linux machines with a wide assortment of modules that are notable for the range of advanced capabilities they provide to attackers.

The framework, referred to as VoidLink by its source code, features more than 30 modules that can be used to customize capabilities to meet attackers’ needs for each infected machine. These modules can provide additional stealth and specific tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement inside a compromised network. The components can be easily added or removed as objectives change over the course of a campaign.

VoidLink can target machines within popular cloud services by detecting if an infected machine is hosted inside AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and there are indications that developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr in future releases. To detect which cloud service hosts the machine, VoidLink examines metadata using the respective vendor’s API.

Similar frameworks targeting Windows servers have flourished for years. They are less common on Linux machines. The feature set is unusually broad and is “far more advanced than typical Linux malware,” said researchers from Checkpoint, the security firm that discovered VoidLink. Its creation may indicate that the attacker’s focus is increasingly expanding to include Linux systems, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment environments, as organizations increasingly move workloads to these environments.

“VoidLink is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to maintain long-term, stealthy access to compromised Linux systems, particularly those running on public cloud platforms and in containerized environments,” the researchers said in a separate post. “Its design reflects a level of planning and investment typically associated with professional threat actors rather than opportunistic attackers, raising the stakes for defenders who may never realize their infrastructure has been quietly taken over.”

The VoidLink interface is localized for Chinese-affiliated operators, an indication that it likely originates from a Chinese-affiliated development environment. Symbols and comments within the source code suggest that VoidLink remains under development. Another sign the framework is not yet completed: Checkpoint found no signs it has infected any machines in the wild. Company researchers discovered it last month in a series of clusters of Linux malware available through VirusTotal.

Included in the batch of binaries was a two-stage loader. The final implant includes core modules embedded that can be augmented by plugins that are downloaded and installed at runtime. The capabilities of the 37 modules discovered so far include:

With no indication that VoidLink is actively targeting machines, there’s no immediate action required by defenders, although they can obtain indicators of compromise from the Checkpoint blog post. VoidLink still indicates defenders should apply vigilance when working with Linux machines.</div>

            <h2>Lawsuit: DHS wants “unlimited subpoena authority” to unmask ICE critics</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is fighting to unmask the owner of Facebook and Instagram accounts of a community watch group monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

Defending the right to post about ICE sightings anonymously is a Meta account holder for MontCo Community Watch, John Doe.

Doe has alleged that when the DHS sent a “summons” to Meta asking for subscriber information, it infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity, i.e., the right to publish content critical of government agencies and officials without fear of government retaliation. He also accused DHS of ignoring federal rules and seeking to vastly expand its authority to subpoena information to unmask ICE’s biggest critics online.

“I believe that my anonymity is the only thing standing between me and unfair and unjust persecution by the government of the United States,” Doe said in his complaint.

In response, DHS alleged that the community watch group that posted “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that a statute regulating imports and exports empowered DHS to investigate the group’s alleged threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder” ICE agents.

DHS claims that Meta must comply with the subpoena because the government needs to investigate a “serious” threat “to the safety of its agents and the performance of their duties.”

On Wednesday, a US district judge will hear arguments to decide if Doe is right or if DHS can broadly unmask critics online by claiming it’s investigating supposed threats to ICE agents. With more power, DHS officials have confirmed they plan to criminally prosecute critics posting ICE videos online, Doe alleged in a lawsuit filed last October.

DHS alleged that the community watch group posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that DHS is authorized to investigate the group and that compelling interest supersedes Doe’s First Amendment rights.

According to Doe’s most recent court filing, DHS is pushing a broad reading of a statute that empowers DHS to subpoena information about the “importation/exportation of merchandise&quot;—like records to determine duties owed or information to unmask a drug smuggler or child sex trafficker. DHS claims the statute isn’t just about imports and exports but also authorizes DHS to seize information about anyone they can tie to an investigation of potential crimes that violate US customs laws.

However, it seems to make no sense, Doe argued, that Congress would “silently embed unlimited subpoena authority in a provision keyed to the importation of goods.” Doe hopes the US district judge will agree that DHS’s summons was unconstitutional.

“The subscriber information for social media accounts publishing speech critical of ICE that DHS seeks is completely unrelated to the importation/exportation of merchandise; the records are outside the scope of DHS’s summons power,” Doe alleged.

And even if the court agrees on DHS’s reading of the statute, DHS has not established that unmasking the owner of the community watch accounts would be relevant to any legitimate criminal investigation, Doe alleged.

To convince the court that the case was really about chilling speech, Doe attached every post made on the group’s Facebook and Instagram feeds. None show threats or arguably implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS claimed. Instead, the users shared “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils,” Doe said.

Ariel Shapell, an attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told Ars that “if you go and look at the content on the Facebook and Instagram profiles at issue here, it’s pretty innocuous.”

DHS claimed to have received information about the group supposedly “stalking and gathering of intelligence on federal agents involved in ICE operations.” However, Doe argued that “unsurprisingly, neither DHS nor its declarant cites any post even allegedly constituting any such threat. To the contrary, all posts on these social media accounts constitute speech addressing important public issues fully protected under the First Amendment,” Doe argued.

“Reporting on, or even livestreaming, publicly occurring immigration operations is fully protected First Amendment activity,” Doe argued. “DHS does not, and cannot, show how such conduct constitutes an assault, kidnapping, or murder of a federal law enforcement officer, or a threat to do any of those things.”

Doe’s motion to quash the subpoena arrives at a time when recent YouGov polling suggests that Americans have reached a tipping point in ending support for ICE. YouGov’s poll found more people disapprove of how ICE is handling its job than approve, following the aftermath of nationwide anti-ICE protests over Renee Good’s killing. ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Good’s death and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

As sharing ICE footage has swayed public debate, DHS has seemingly sought to subpoena Meta and possibly other platforms for subscriber information.

In October, Meta refused to provide names of users associated with Doe’s accounts—as well as “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses&quot;—without further information from DHS. Meta then gave Doe the opportunity to move to quash the subpoena to stop the company from sharing information.

That request came about a week after DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests after account holders defended First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash the subpoena, Doe’s court filing said.

It’s unclear why DHS withdrew those subpoenas but maintained Doe’s. DHS has alleged that the government’s compelling interest in Doe’s identity outweighs First Amendment rights to post anonymously online. The agency also claimed it has met its burden to unmask Doe as “someone who is allegedly involved in threatening ICE agents and impeding the performance of their duties,” which supposedly “touches DHS’s investigation into threats to ICE agents and impediments to the performance of their duties.”

Whether Doe will prevail is hard to say, but Politico reported that DHS’s “defense will rest on whether DHS’s argument that posting videos and images of ICE officers and warnings about arrests is considered criminal activity.” It may weaken DHS’s case that Border Patrol Tactical Commander Greg Bovino recently circulated a “legal refresher” for agents in the field, reminding them that protestors are allowed to take photos and videos of “an officer or operation in public,” independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported.

Shapell told Ars that there seems to be “a lot of distance” between the content posted on Doe’s accounts and relevant evidence that could be used in DHS’s alleged investigation into criminal activity. And meanwhile, “there are just very clear First Amendment rights here to associate with other people anonymously online and to discuss political opinions online anonymously,” Shapell said, which the judge may strongly uphold as core protected activity as threats of government retaliation mount.

“These summonses chill people’s desire to communicate about these sorts of incredibly important developments on the Internet, even anonymously, when there’s a threat that they could be unmasked and investigated for this really core First Amendment protected activity,” Shapell said.

A win could reassure Meta users that they can continue posting about ICE online without fear of retaliation should Meta be pressed to share their information.

Ars could not immediately reach DHS for comment. Meta declined to comment, only linking Ars to an FAQ to help users understand how the platform processes government requests.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, tech corporations have made it no secret that their end goal is to replace all jobs with AI — thus cementing themselves as indispensable to the world economy. But what happens if we actually get to that point?

Either they don’t have a clue, or they don’t want to say.

Speaking at a press conference last month, Geoffrey Hinton — a pioneer in the field of neural networks, the bedrock of modern AI — remarked that “it’s clear that a lot of jobs are going to disappear: it’s not clear that it’s going to create a lot of jobs to replace that.”

Often lauded as a “godfather of AI,” Hinton has gone on the record many times to warn about the social cost of AI solutionism in an economic system driven by profit. “This isn’t AI’s problem,” he continued last month. “This is our political system’s problem. If you get a massive increase in productivity, how does that wealth get shared around?”

It’s a critically important question as AI spending becomes integral to the US economy, yet one which tech corporations and the moguls heading them have been at a loss to answer.

SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, for example, has waxed poetic about a future in which AI and robotics could make us all rich. Currently the world’s wealthiest person himself, Musk has spent some time over the last few weeks bleating about “universal high income,” a take on universal basic income where every out-of-work peon would live comfortably off the prosperity of private corporations, like his beleaguered AI venture, xAI.

Of course, as The New Yorker‘s John Cassidy observes, such material abundance for displaced workers won’t be possible unless Musk and his fellow billionaires agree to share their largesse. (As Martin Luther King Jr wrote from Birmingham Jail, “it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.”)

OpenAI’s Sam Altman has echoed Musk’s ideas, saying he hopes AI can bring about what he calls “universal extreme wealth,” in which everyone basically has ownership stakes in every AI company.

Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind and CEO of Microsoft AI, has called AI a “fundamentally labor-replacing tool,” which is evidently worth the mass economic turmoil, because “in 15 or 20 years’ time, we will be producing new scientific, cultural knowledge at almost zero marginal cost.”

Overall, it’s hard to see this scenario coming to pass. Currently, Goldman Sachs only predicts a 7 percent increase in global GDP over the next ten years due to AI, while the Penn Wharton Budget Model foresees a 3.7 percent boost to GDP by 2075.

Any AI-driven bump in GDP would undoubtedly be a boost — but far from the one needed to avoid widespread poverty and anguish without major concessions from the billionaire class. But hey, if they’re serious about it, there’s never been a better time for them to put their money where their mouth is.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 6, NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, which has been studying the Red Planet’s upper atmosphere for over a decade, mysteriously went offline.

The spacecraft was expected to send telemetry back to Earth, signals that were never picked up by NASA’s Deep Space Network, a global system of massive radio antennas making up an interplanetary communications network.

Less than a week later, NASA issued a new update, admitting that MAVEN appeared to be “rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars.” Then, on December 23, the agency issued its last update, promising that it’s “continuing efforts to recontact” its lost spacecraft.

But weeks later, things aren’t looking much better. As SpaceNews senior writer Jeff Foust pointed out, NASA planetary science division director Louise Prockter conceded during a Tuesday meeting that the agency is “very unlikely” to recover the MAVEN orbiter.

Not all hope is lost. Mars’ solar conjunction, a weeks-long period when Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun, will end on January 16, which will give NASA a new opportunity to reestablish contact.

In its latest December 23 update, NASA explained that the MAVEN team was attempting to “create a timeline of possible events and identify the likely root cause of the issue” by analyzing “tracking data fragments recovered from a December 6 radio science campaign.”

NASA also leveraged the Mastcam instrument attached to its Curiosity rover to attempt to take a picture of MAVEN, but failed to detect the missing spacecraft.

It’s a sad state of affairs, but fortunately there are three other spacecraft that can still relay communications between Mars missions and the Earth. A next-generation orbiter, dubbed Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, was also recently revived in president Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” act — though it remains unclear when it will launch.

For now, all we can hope is that NASA’s renewed efforts to make contact with MAVEN will prove successful once it emerges from behind Mars once again. But given Prockter’s latest comments, the situation isn’t looking promising.

            <div id="article-text">The future is here, and it’s bouncing all over the back alleys of China.

Numerous clips of autonomous delivery vans ripping around cities have swirled on Chinese social media in recent days, showcasing the new technology’s capabilities — as well as its many, many shortcomings.

One video which went viral on the Pinterest-like app Xiaohongshu shows a Neolix X3 unit bouncing aggressively as it barrels down a potholed gravel path. The X3 sports two massive lithium batteries on the bottom of its chassis, a configuration which clearly isn’t helping the vehicle’s suspension as it rattles down the block.

“The roads are still from the Qing Dynasty, but the cars are from the next century,” one user wrote under the original post.

Other examples abound, like one of the smaller Neolix X3s freaking out over a road littered with corn cobs, or the stubborn ZTO express delivery van which got itself stuck after driving through wet cement.

In one clip from September, a Shenzhen woman tried in vain to stop a robovan from running over her prized vegetables, which she had been drying out on the side of the road.

The sheer number of clips are indicative of the massive rollout of self-driving vans throughout China.

Neolix, for example, says it’s deployed over 10,000 robovans across 300 cities as of October, according to The Robot Report. In Qingdao alone, there are already more than 1,200 self-driving cargo vans, which have racked over 31 million miles and thousands of deliveries since they’ve been in operation.

Though Neolix isn’t the only robovan company operating throughout the People’s Republic, it’s certainly the biggest. It was the first to obtain an autonomous delivery license in 2021, enabling it to start accumulating miles on select public roads.

Other companies, like Rino.ai, are following in Neolix’s footsteps, with over 2,000 self-driving vans on the road in over 170 cities.

While the clips are unquestionably entertaining, the robovans are clearly presenting a safety hazard on the roads — and likely a glimpse of things to come for the rest of the world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

And though not nearly as large or expensive as the James Webb Space Telescope, the 17-inch lens packs a specialized punch that’ll help astronomers do something that was unthinkable just a decade or two ago: glean clues from individual exoplanets too remote for even the mighty Webb to pick up on.

Pandora’s mission will last a year, during which it’s expected to complete observations of at least 20 exoplanets — as well, in a novel development, of the stars they orbit.

This will “shatter a barrier,” according to University of Arizona astronomer Daniel Apai, whose team helped build the telescope — helping “remove a source of noise in the data that limits our ability to study small exoplanets in detail and search for life on them,” he wrote in a new piece for The Conversation.

Exoplanets are incredibly difficult to find, and even harder to study. Look up into the night sky, and you will effortlessly spot millions of stars. The first exoplanet, in contrast, wasn’t confirmed until 1992; to this day, astronomers have found only around 6,000 planets around other stars, a task hindered because the little-if-any light they reflect is blown out by that of nearby stars.

To espy distant worlds, astronomers look for when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. This is called a transit, and it produces a noticeable dip in the starlight. What’s more, astronomers can analyze the light to tease out properties of the planet it passes through, like the chemicals in its atmosphere. Apai, who is also co-investigator of Pandora, compares this to holding a glass of wine up to a candle: “The light filtering through will show fine details that reveal the quality of the wine.”

Likewise, “by analyzing starlight filtered through the planets’ atmospheres,” he continued, “astronomers can find evidence for water vapor, hydrogen, clouds and even search for evidence of life.”

Astronomers have relied on this clever trick for decades, but recent research, some of it spearheaded by Apai and his colleagues, has shown that it can have a serious flaw. Cooler, volatile regions on the surface of stars, called starspots, can fudge the signals astronomers see, even tricking them into mistaking the water vapor around a star for being present on the planet. Essentially, “we were trying to judge our wine in light of flickering, unstable candles,” Apai said.

That’s where Pandora comes in. Being purpose-built for exoplanet hunting, it can spend far more time observing them than Webb, whose precious time is always in hot demand. Even better, Pandora will observe the stars themselves for 24 hours at a time with infrared and visible light sensors, closely monitoring how the starspots form and evolve. Over the course of its year-long mission, the telescope will revisit each star ten times, racking up hundreds of hours of observations.

“With that information, our Pandora team will be able to figure out how the changes in the stars affect the observed planetary transits,” Apai wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less time than it takes to get bored of your new year’s resolution, the planet’s wealthiest people had already blown through their yearly ration of carbon emissions.

We’re not speaking figuratively, either. A new analysis by the Oxfam Foundation found that the world’s richest 1 percent exceeded their fair share of annual carbon emissions just 10 days into the year.

The global “carbon budget” is based off the amount of carbon dioxide that humankind can collectively spew while keeping us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. According to Oxfam, the CO2 emissions of the richest 1 percent in just one year will result in an estimated 1.3 million heat-related deaths by the end of the 21st century.

“To stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, the richest 1 percent would have to slash their emissions by 97 percent by 2030,” the study’s press release reads.

Meanwhile, it only took the top 0.1 percent until January 3rd to use up their allotment. Another recent Oxfam report using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the richest 0.1 percent of individuals produce more CO2 pollution in a day than the poorest 50 percent do in a year.

“If everyone emitted like the richest 0.1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in less than three weeks,” Oxfam implores.

These outrageous figures aren’t just a measure of individual consumption, but of economic power. Since 2024, the top 1 percent has owned more wealth than 95 percent of humanity — not just in cash, but through ownership of powerful assets like mega-corporations and real estate holdings.

The real issue, in other words, isn’t finger wagging about individual consumer choices. The global economy has been built around a vast over-consumption that’s rapidly leading the planet into ecological catastrophe, and the world’s wealthiest are profiting massively. In 2019 for example, an analysis by The Guardian found that just20 fossil fuel companies were responsible for 35 percent of all CO2 and methane pollution since 1965.

Staving off environmental collapse, in other words, will require a difficult confrontation with some of the world’s richest people and the powerful corporations that built their fortunes.

“Time and time again, the research shows that governments have a very clear and simple route to drastically slash carbon emissions and tackle inequality: by targeting the richest polluters,” said Oxfam’s climate change policy lead, Nafkote Dabi. “By cracking down on the gross carbon recklessness of the super-rich, global leaders have an opportunity to put the world back on track for climate targets and unlock net benefits for people and the planet.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicholas Leonard and Derek Caneja wanted to build AI voice agents, but when they went to build the product, they felt many of these voice agents had design flaws.

Some of these agents were being built with no-code tools, meaning shipping to production was fast, but the quality of the product was often low. Other agents were being made by companies that had the time and resources to spend months building specialized tools. “Developers and enterprises needed an alternative,” Leonard told TechCrunch, adding that he and Caneja also realized that the future of software would be “coded, validated, and optimized by coding agents.”

“These two insights and a historical realization gave us the inspiration for VoiceRun,” Leonard, the company’s CEO, said. Caneja is the company’s CTO.

Last year, they decided to launch VoiceRun, a platform that lets developers and coding assistants launch and scale voice agents. Right now, many of these low-code platforms let people build voice agents with visual diagrams, where people click through conversation flows and write prompts into boxes that then dictate how the agent should behave. All of that can be hard to manage, Leonard said.

VoiceRun, on the other hand, lets users code how they want their voice agents to behave, giving them more flexibility in creating the product they want. Code is the native language of coding agents, Leonard explained. “They are going to do a far better job operating in code than in a visual interface,” Leonard said.

Furthermore, with visuals, there are limited configuration options, so, for example, if someone wanted to build a voice agent that could speak in a different dialect, it might be harder to do if the maker of the visual interface didn’t build a feature that can handle that task.

“But in code, it’s incredibly simple to do,” he said. “There is a long tail of millions of examples of little things you might want to do that aren’t supported by the visual interface.”

Aside from coding agents, VoiceRun also lets users perform A/B testing and deploy instantly with one click.

The company is geared toward enterprise developers, helping companies, for example, incorporate AI into their customer services, or help tech companies launch voice-based products. He mentioned, for example, working with a restaurant-tech company launching an AI phone concierge for food reservations.

The company announced on Wednesday the closing of a $5.5 million seed round led by Flybridge Capital.

There is a lot of competition in the AI agent space. Startups in this area last year nabbed billions of dollars (out of the many billions that flooded into AI companies in general). Leonard feels his company is up against two ends of the market: There are the no-code voice builders, like Bland and ReTell AI, he said, that lets user build quick demos. There are also more sophisticated tools, like LiveKt and Pipecat, which give developers “maximum control.” He feels Voicerun sits in the middle of these two ends.

“​​We provide global voice infrastructure and an evaluation-driven lifecycle, while keeping ownership of business logic code and data in the customer’s hands,” he said. “The key difference is that we are closing the loop for end-to-end coding agent development. We expect developers to be supervising coding agents that write code, run tests, deploy, and propose improvements.”

In some ways, Leonard is hoping his product helps developers create voice agent tools that will, in turn, help people feel more comfortable with automated voices. Customers today “feel relief” when a human answers the phone, “because voice automation has been brittle and ineffective.”

A survey from Five9 last year showed that three-fourths of its survey respondents still prefer talking to a human when it comes to customer service matters. Leonard said he wants to change this perception because “human agents today have their own limitations,” like language barriers or making people feel judged.

“There were great cars before the Model T, but vehicles didn’t become ubiquitous until the assembly line,” Leonard said. “There are great voice agents today, but they won’t be ubiquitous until the voice agent factory is built. VoiceRun is that factory.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is laying off 10% of staff in its Reality Labs division, which is core to developing the company’s VR and metaverse products, the New York Times reported.

The publication noted that Reality Labs had roughly 15,000 employees, and the job cuts could impact over 1,000 people.

Separately, CNBC reported that the company plans to shut down studios such as Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, along with a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology, which was working on VR titles. Business Insider reported that the company’s CTO and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, called for the “most important” in-person meeting of the year on January 14.

The NYT reported that the job cuts would not impact folks working on augmented reality, as the company has big ambitions to develop glasses and controllers. The report also noted that the money saved from these cuts will be used for AR development.

The news comes as Meta, which changed its entire brand from to focus on the metaverse in 2021, is pouring its resources into AI development. In October, the company moved metaverse head Vishal Shah to oversee AI products as a vice president, and last year, reorganized to set up its Superintelligence Labs after poaching Alexandr Wang from Scale AI. The company went on to offer top packages to researchers working at other labs to lure them to join Meta.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <h2>SkyFi raises $12.7M to turn satellite images into insights</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/skyfi-raises-12-7m-to-turn-satellite-images-into-insights/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, and an increasing number of them are able to capture all types of images in near real time.

It used to be a somewhat cumbersome process to access those images. But Austin-based startup SkyFi has built a platform that acts as a sort of “Getty Images” for more than 50 geospatial imagery partners that has proven popular in the worlds of finance, defense, infrastructure, and insurance — to name a few.

That popularity escalated as SkyFi began offering more analytics and insights to its customers through its website and mobile app, along with the ability to “task” satellites to capture images of a location at a specific time, CEO Luke Fischer recently told TechCrunch in an interview.

“I think the real goal for us is providing answers for customers, both government and commercial,” Fischer said. “Imagery is a commodity, or it’s closely becoming a commodity, [so it’s] not just about speed of delivery, but more importantly, speed of delivery of answers to customers.”

Being able to offer insights along with easy-to-access imagery is a big reason why SkyFi was just able to close a $12.7 million Series A funding round, according to Fischer.

That’s reflected in the investor makeup of the round. It was co-led by climate-focused fund Buoyant Ventures and IronGate Capital Advisors, which invests in dual-use companies. Other investors included DNV Ventures (the investment arm of 160-year-old maritime company DNV), Beyond Earth Ventures (a space-focused firm), and TFX Capital (which has made a number of defense-related space investments).

Fischer said he and co-founder Bill Perkins — who comes from the hedge fund world, hence the emphasis on generating actionable insights — initially only sought to raise a round of about $8 million.

But 2025 was a record year for defense-related investments, and SkyFi received more investor demand than expected, Fischer said. The company upped its target to $10 million, and again to $12 million, before arriving at the $12.7 million figure after some strategic investors joined the round. (One was DNV; Fischer declined to name the other on the record.)

Fischer said SkyFi used to have a harder time convincing satellite imagery providers to hand over access to their data. Now, he said, onboarding new providers is “table stakes.”

“It took a took a little bit for us to get to this point, [but] we have largest virtual constellation of assets. That means we have all the data supply in the world for us, all the different sensor types,” he said. SkyFi has been able to leverage all of that data and, crucially, the many requests it’s received from customers over the last few years to build up analytical offerings worth selling to commercial and government customers.

“We know better than anyone what they’re asking for,” he said.

Fischer said he learned first-hand how powerful this kind of feedback loop can be from his time helping lead Uber’s Elevate division.

“Uber has data on where people move in the world. They layer different products, the bikes, the scooters, the electric aircraft, the drone delivery. We have that equivalent data on what people are looking at in the world they’re asking of that data,” he said. “It gives us a much better purview. And again. We’re software first, so I don’t have the burden of having to pay for hardware capital expenses.”

Some of those customers will want to do their own analytics, like the hedge funds, Fischer explained. But most are increasingly interested in what SkyFi has to offer on the insights side, he said.

The company plans to use the new funding to expand on all this, though Fischer is clearly proud of building a product that is deeply capable but inherently approachable, to the point that even his family uses the product.

“My teenage daughters task satellites for their high school, and now college, homework on their iPhones,” he said.

            <h2>New York governor clears path for robotaxis everywhere, with one notable exception</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York Governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state — except for its most populous metropolis: New York City.

Hochul, who made the comments Tuesday during her State of the State address, said the legislation would advance the next phase of the state’s autonomous vehicle pilot program.

Details on the proposed legislation and when it might be released are thin. However, there are some hints contained within a document that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address.

Among them is language to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.”

The document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that “demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.”

It’s not clear what “limited deployment” or “highest possible safety standards” mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company’s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.

The governor’s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor’s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.

Still, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer.

“Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York’s transportation system,” Justin Kintz, Waymo’s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement.

“With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,” said Kintz.

Waymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.

The state’s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.

Still, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.

Even with the permit, Waymo can’t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission.

And while legislation was introduced last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate’s transportation committee. The governor’s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/microsoft-announces-glut-of-new-data-centers-but-says-it-wont-let-your-electricity-bill-go-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.

Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.

On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.

“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”

The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.

It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.

This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.

Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”

In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.

            <h2>A consumer watchdog issued a warning about Google’s AI agent shopping protocol — Google says she’s wrong</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.

In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”

Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.

She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.

After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.

In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”

In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.

Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”

The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.

Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.

She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”

Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.

The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.

That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.

Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Adam Sharples became a molecular physiologist studying muscle memory, he played professional rugby. Over his years as an athlete, he noticed that he and his teammates seemed to return to form after the offseason, or even from an injury, faster than expected. Rebuilding muscle mass and strength came easy: It was as if their muscles remembered what to do.

In 2018, Sharples and his research lab, now at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo, were the first to show that exercise could change how our muscle-building genes work over the long term. The genes themselves don’t change, but repeated periods of exertion turns certain genes on, spurring cells to build muscle mass more quickly than before. These epigenetic changes have a lasting effect: Your muscles remember these periods of strength and respond favorably in the future.

Intuitively, this makes sense. Past exercise primes your muscles to respond more robustly to more exercise. Over the past few years, Sharples’s lab has found that muscles have additional molecular mechanisms for remembering exercise; he and other scientists have been building on this research, too, confirming epigenetic muscle memory in young and aged human muscle, after different modes of training, as well as in mice. Now 40 years old, Sharples is still thinking about how our muscles remember but has lately been investigating the inverse trajectory: Do muscles have a similar memory for weakness?

The answer appears to be yes. “Our new data shows that muscle does not just remember growth—it also remembers wasting,” Sharples told me, of a study published in preprint on bioRxiv and currently in peer review for Advanced Science. “The more encounters you have with injury and illness, the more susceptible your muscle is to further atrophy. And, well—that’s what aging is, isn’t it?”

The Norwegian government’s research council has been funding Sharples’s research and has a vested interest in the lab’s discoveries. In the next decade, Norway is expected to become a “super-aged society,” in which more than one in five people are age 65 or older. Japan and Germany have already crossed this threshold, and the United States is expected to reach it by 2030. Age-related muscle weakness is a major factor in falling risk; falling is a leading cause worldwide of injury and death in people 65 and older. Better understanding how muscles remember and react to their weakest moments is a crucial step toward knowing what to do about it.

As part of the new study, Sharples’s team studied repeated periods of atrophy in young human muscle, using a knee brace and crutches to immobilize participants’ legs for two weeks at a time. This level of disuse, Sharples said, is comparable to real-world situations in which muscle rapidly loses size and function—limb immobilization after fractures or other injuries, periods of hospitalization or bed rest, reduced weight-bearing during recovery. A couple of years ago, I went to observe this research for my book On Muscle; one study participant, an avid skier and cyclist, told me he was shocked by how significantly the muscles in his leg deteriorated after just a couple of weeks of immobilization. The team also ran a concurrent study in aged rat muscle, in collaboration with Liverpool John Moores University; in both studies, repeated periods of disuse led to epigenetic changes—shifts in the way genes were expressed.

These changes affected the core functions of muscle cells, hampering the genes in mitochondria—the powerhouses of the cell, which generate the energy required to contract and relax muscle fibers. Letting muscles weaken suppressed genes involved in mitochondrial function and energy production in particular, including genes that are essential for muscle endurance and recovery. The researchers also found that a key marker of mitochondrial abundance dropped more drastically after repeated atrophy than after the first episode, indicating that repeated disuse makes muscle more vulnerable. In other words, the evidence suggests that every time you fall down the hole, it becomes more difficult to climb back out.

Similar changes occurred in both the young human muscle and the aged rat muscle. But the young muscle could adapt and recover. After repeated atrophy, it showed a less exaggerated gene-expression response than the aged muscle did. “There seems to be some resilience and protection with young muscle the second time around,” Sharples said. He likened this to an immune-system response: Young muscle responds better to atrophy the second time because it has encountered it before and knows how to bounce back. By contrast, aged muscle becomes more sensitive after repeated atrophy, showing a worsened response with the second episode.

How long our muscles hold on to any of these memories is still up for debate. “Because of our study periods, we do know with some certainty that epigenetic memories can last at least three to four months, and that protein changes can also be retained,” Sharples said. “How long after that is difficult to say. But we know from our studies of cancer patients that epigenetic changes in muscle were retained even 10 years out from cancer survival.”

This was startling to hear. If an adverse health event is dramatic enough, like cancer, our muscles can carry the effects of that for a decade or more. More typically, though, inactivity, aging, and repeated episodes of disuse may gradually shift the system toward a state in which weakness becomes more entrenched and recovery slower.

Understanding what drives muscle to remember being in stress situations—either beneficial, like exercise, or damaging, like illness—could help us better judge what to do about this, says Kevin Murach, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas who studies aging and skeletal muscle and who was not involved in the new study. Knowing the mechanisms that drive beneficial changes at the molecular level could help develop drugs with similar effects. On the other end of the spectrum, if illness and immobilization have long-term negative effects, Murach told me, the next question to answer is: “Can we use exercise to offset that?”

Both Murach and Sharples said the data are getting only more robust that strength training, paired with endurance or high-intensity interval training, is the best therapy to protect against age-related loss of muscle and function. “Perhaps the key takeaway is that at any point along this continuum, new exercise or loading stimuli can still shift the balance back towards growth and health,” Sharples said. “I don’t think there is a point at which muscle can’t respond at all—it simply becomes less efficient when repeatedly weakened or when older.”

Identifying genes associated with muscle growth, as well as pharmaceutical targets, could mean that drugs or gene therapy may eventually be able to assist with boosting muscle response for people who cannot exercise. Murach and Sharples cautioned, though, that stimulating muscle-cell growth can have unintended consequences, in part because growth pathways are common across cell types—including cancer cells.

What the new work does show is that our muscle mass is not a blank slate. “What we’re finding suggests that our muscles may carry a history of both strength and weakness,” Sharples said. It’s shaped by factors including age, baseline muscle health, previous atrophy events, and previous exercise training. “And that history shapes how our muscles respond in the future.” I came away from our conversation thinking about the battle between positive muscle memory for strength and negative muscle memory for atrophy as a kind of tug-of-war: The two are constantly in tension, but the more experiences you have of one or the other, the more it pulls you into its embrace.</div>

            <h2>He Was Homeschooled for Years, and Fell So Far Behind</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/01/homeschooled-book-regulations/685589/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the early 1990s, when Stefan Merrill Block was in fourth grade, he began complaining to his mom about his new school, with its pointless rules and mean teachers. He, his parents, and his brother had recently moved to the Dallas suburb of Plano from Indianapolis, and Block, a perceptive and sensitive child, could tell that his mother was unhappy in their new home, too. Together, they made a “lovely picnic” of their anger, as he describes it in his new memoir, Homeschooled. His mother pulled him out of the classroom and into a life of shapeless days, setting Block on a strange, yearslong journey as her only pupil, only friend, and at times, it seems, only hope.

Block’s memoir is timely; homeschooling has grown rapidly in recent years. Although people regarded Block as an oddity in his youth—“The boy should be in school!” his visiting grandma exclaimed at one point—now more than 3 percent of school-age kids in the United States, or about 2 million children, are homeschooled.

Under his mother’s warped version of homeschooling, Block was largely left to pursue his own “interests,” which included reading novels, drawing comics, and watching Oprah. In Block’s telling, his father, a busy psychologist, mostly turned a blind eye to these aimless afternoons. As days of unstructured exploration stretched out before him, Block writes, he realized that “the longer I stay here, the further I will fall behind, and the harder it will be ever to go back.”

Read: Educated is a brutal, one-of-a-kind memoir

He was right to be concerned. When Block finally returned to school for ninth grade, he earned grades in the C to F range. He recalls thinking that “the Civil War was thus named because, despite all the bloodshed, Americans exhibited remarkably good etiquette.” It took him cutting down to four or five hours of sleep a night and going, as he puts it, “sporadically psychotic” to catch up on his studies.

Block’s experience sounds extreme and readers of the book may wonder how this was allowed to happen to him. In the years that Block was homeschooled, why was he never assessed, or even checked on? The answer is that homeschooling was wildly under-regulated when Block was a boy—a situation that has not changed much since then. About half of states, Texas among them, do not require homeschoolers to be evaluated, and not all states require an intervention if a student is found to be failing, according to Jonah Stewart, the director of programs at the Coalition for Responsible Home Education (CRHE), which advocates for stricter homeschooling regulations. In some of the states with testing mandates, parents can circumvent the rule by registering with an “umbrella school,” many of which offer real support for homeschoolers, and others of which exist largely as shells to help parents evade requirements. Or students can take their exams at home—which raises the question of how reliable the scores are. Only two states, New York and Pennsylvania, require the homeschooler to take a test with a qualified proctor, Stewart told me. Tess Ulrey, CRHE’s executive director, told me, “For a lot of homeschooled students, the first time they’re going to take a standardized test is maybe the SAT, the ACT.”

Because not every homeschool student takes reliable tests, knowing how well they are doing academically is difficult. Some research, much of it conducted by homeschooling advocates, has found that homeschool students tend to perform well. But other homeschooling researchers have argued that these studies mask substantial variation in the quality of homeschooling because they don’t rely on representative samples.

And some research provides cause for concern: One series of large surveys found that homeschoolers earned worse SAT scores and ended up in lower-paying jobs than traditionally schooled kids. When controlling for demographics, one study found that homeschoolers were two to three times more likely to be behind their expected grade level than their traditionally schooled peers. A 2020 review of many studies found that homeschoolers generally excel in reading but lag in math, perhaps because, as some researchers theorize, homeschooling families tend to emphasize reading over math. For the student population at large, the average SAT math score is also lower than the average reading score, though only slightly.

Beyond the academic considerations, under-regulated homeschooling can also make some kids vulnerable to abuse. Though most homeschool parents are responsible and well-intentioned, some child-abuse experts say that a small percentage mistreat their children. Multiple stories of children who were abused in supposed homeschooling environments have surfaced in recent years. (Some of the parents have pleaded not guilty.) A 2014 paper examining the cases of 28 severely abused children from various states found that eight of the 17 school-age victims had been withdrawn from traditional school for homeschooling. A report from Connecticut found that from 2013 to 2016, 36 percent of families in the state who began homeschooling had been the subject of at least one prior abuse or neglect report. Nationally, the CRHE has documented nearly 200 deaths of homeschooled kids from abuse or neglect since 2000. Although traditionally schooled kids are also abused and neglected, they at least regularly see adults outside their immediate family, which opens up the possibility of their reaching out for help. With homeschoolers, however, a lack of contact between families and the authorities can cause abuse to go unnoticed: About a dozen states do not require parents to notify the state that they are homeschooling their children, according to Stewart.

Robert Kunzman, an education professor at Indiana University Bloomington who has studied homeschooling, recommends three regulatory reforms that he believes would limit much of the abuse and educational neglect within homeschooling while preserving parents’ rights to educate their own children: Parents should notify the state that they are homeschooling, adults convicted of child abuse should not be allowed to homeschool, and homeschooled children should take an annual basic-skills test.

The Home School Legal Defense Association, a prominent pro-homeschooling advocacy group, opposes these ideas. The group’s president, Jim Mason, told me that “parents who homeschool are fully subject to the same criminal, child-protection, and neglect laws as every other parent.” He pointed to a study in the Journal of School Choice, co-authored by a researcher whose organization has received support from homeschooling groups, that found “a lack of evidence for disproportionately associating homeschooling with child abuse and neglect.”

The association and other groups like it have significant political power and tend to rally to defeat state bills that would require inspections or other forms of oversight. Even high-profile reports of abused homeschooled children rarely result in stronger regulations. In 2018, after news broke that the California couple David and Louise Turpin had imprisoned and tortured their 13 “homeschooled” children for decades, California Assemblymember Jose Medina introduced legislation that would have directed the fire marshal to inspect all homeschools in the state. After an outcry from hundreds of homeschool parents, the bill died in committee. The story is much the same in Texas: The Texas Home School Coalition employs lobbyists it calls “watchmen,” after a Bible verse that says, “I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night.” With the coalition’s backing, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed three new bills supporting homeschool rights just this past summer.

As for Block: Despite his challenging childhood, he has built an impressive life for himself. He graduated from a top-tier college and now has a family, has written several books, and co-owns a skating rink. Still, in his author’s note, Block writes that although he does not oppose homeschooling in general, he does think that “the lack of proper homeschooling oversight has become a crisis.”

In a time of school shootings, classroom bullying, culture wars over curricula, and faltering test scores, the impulse of some parents to take over their child’s education is understandable. But as Block’s story illustrates, allowing parents to isolate their kids at home with little accountability can be incredibly harmful. If homeschool parents are so certain that they are giving their kids a good education in a safe environment, they could reasonably be expected to show it.

            <h2>MAGA Thinks Maduro Will Prove Trump Won in 2020</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/maduro-venezuela-conspiracy-theory/685599/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the days after American commandos raided Nicolás Maduro’s compound and whisked him out of Venezuela, Mike Lindell wasn’t ruminating about the dramatic military operation or oil prices—he was reviving a long-dead conspiracy theory.

Lindell, better known as the “MyPillow guy,” was celebrating because, in his telling, a possible witness to the theory that Venezuela conspired with election-equipment companies to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump was now in U.S. custody. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean and tell us everything about the machines and how they steal the elections,” Lindell, who has long espoused election falsehoods, told me the day after the Venezuelan dictator’s arraignment.

The supposition boils down to this: Venezuela plotted with election-equipment and -technology companies to engineer Trump’s defeat in 2020. There is no credible evidence to support this. But with Maduro in U.S. custody months before the midterms and the Trump administration investigating the 2020 election, an idea that had been disproved by facts and debunked in lawsuits has been revived, with a newsy twist: Now Maduro will prove from a New York jail that Trump defeated Joe Biden.

Since Maduro’s capture, Trump has shared a raft of discredited election-fraud claims on his Truth Social site, including one tied to a company central to the Venezuela conspiracy. A top Justice Department official helped harden the narrative: Ed Martin, the United States pardon attorney (who also directs the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group, which pursues retribution against Trump’s perceived political enemies), promoted the idea that Maduro could offer crucial information to substantiate the stolen-election theory once and for all. Martin reposted on X a claim that Maduro could try “to plead to lesser charges by proffering evidence that the 2020 election was stolen,” adding “!”

The right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, an extremely online Trump-administration ally, claimed that Maduro “is in possession” of evidence against election-equipment companies. “Maduro might be Trump’s final revenge for the election theft of 2020,” Johnson told his audience. “If he begins to sing like a canary—which he will; they always do—then who will he give up?” Johnson added: “This is why they took him alive.”

Read: ‘Stop counting votes or we’re going to murder your children’

The conspiracy theory traces back to the days after the 2020 election. Trump allies, including his lawyers at the time Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, claimed that Trump had been denied a win because two voting-equipment companies, Dominion Voting Systems (which was sold last year and is operating under the name Liberty Vote) and Smartmatic, had flipped votes for Biden. The systems and software, Powell said at the time, were “created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chávez to make sure he never lost an election.”

Powell and Giuliani settled lawsuits with Dominion over election falsehoods. (The settlement details are confidential.) Smartmatic has reached legal settlements with right-leaning media outlets over false statements about the company. One of them, Newsmax, wrote on its website last year that “it has no evidence that Smartmatic machines or software altered the votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.” It continued: “Smartmatic is a U.S. company not owned by the Venezuelan government, or any foreign official or entity.”

Smartmatic also won a defamation case last year against Lindell. That hasn’t stopped him from reviving claims of a stolen election after Maduro’s apprehension. Lindell told me last week that he had turned “a book” that he compiled about the 2020 election (Lindell also told me he’s “sure” it includes versions of the theory that Venezuela helped steal it) over to federal officials. He would not say who, specifically, but said he hoped that the Justice Department and other federal authorities were investigating. Lindell predicted that he, Powell (who could not be reached for comment), and many others would be vindicated. “I’m hoping now that Maduro will actually come clean,” he told me, “and tell all about the machines and how they steal the elections.”

The Venezuelan-voting-machine conspiracy theory has returned as the Trump administration is using the government to investigate a valid election whose outcome the president didn’t like. (Trump apparently harbors regrets for not doing more to overturn the results, telling The New York Times that “I should have” had the National Guard seize voting machines in 2020.) The Guardian reported in November that federal investigators were interviewing people who were claiming that Venezuela had helped rob Trump of a win. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said during a Cabinet meeting last April that investigators had “evidence of how these electronic voting systems have been vulnerable to hackers for a very long time.” At an August Cabinet meeting, Trump asked Gabbard if she had found information tied to “how corrupt the 2020 election was. When will that all come out?” Gabbard responded that she would brief Trump once she had all of the information, adding, “We are finding documents literally tucked away in the back of safes and random offices.”

The administration has also been attempting to access local voting equipment. A Department of Homeland Security official, with the help of a political operative, unsuccessfully sought access last year to vote-counting machines in Colorado, but county clerks rebuffed the requests to examine the tightly controlled equipment. Two GOP clerks in Missouri also rejected requests from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to examine their machines. And Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who challenged Trump’s 2020 loss in court, was tapped last fall to probe that election as a special government employee, The Wall Street Journal reported. Olsen has told people he wants, among other things, to examine equipment used during the 2020 election, according to the Journal. (Olsen didn’t respond to the Journal’s request for comment or one I left with him.)

The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. has safe and secure elections and that he has long said Maduro “was an illegitimate, narco-terrorist.” In response to Trump’s election-related executive order last March (titled “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections”), she said the Department of Homeland Security is preparing a report on the cybersecurity of election systems and “will deliver that report shortly.&quot; (The Department of Justice, Liberty Vote, and Smartmatic did not return my requests for comment.)

Election administrators around the country who have been abused and harassed for the past six years are keeping a wary eye on the resurgence of the conspiracy theories. In Colorado, a county-clerks association is drafting an FAQ to help election officials navigate questions they may get from constituents about voting machines and Venezuela. In Arizona, election officials are worried enough to ensure that a cybersecurity analyst is monitoring the online chatter. If it escalates, officials could push back publicly against the falsehoods. In Utah, Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman told me she’s tracking the misinformation and is prepared to weigh in, if needed: “It’s a full-time job trying to explain this, let alone successfully administering elections.”

Every time those in power amplify inaccurate information about elections, election clerks and experts tell me, they risk deepening doubt in the democratic process. Even without getting states to change the ways that people vote, experts worry that a selective release of findings or evidence tied to the Venezuela claims could be used by the Trump administration to justify some sort of government action.

“It’s almost like an RFP for conspiracy theories,” Alexandra Chandler, a former Department of Defense intelligence analyst who now works as the director of the nonprofit Protect Democracy’s election team, told me.

Under the Constitution, states are responsible for running elections. But Trump has used the power of the federal government to rejuvenate debunked claims and set the stage for another battle over the validity of future elections if he dislikes the results. He’s staffed his administration with people who have sown doubt over the legitimacy of election outcomes, sparked a redistricting war for control of the House, and issued an executive order attempting to claim federal authority over elections.

Lawrence Norden, vice president of the elections-and-government program at the Brennan Center for Justice, sees more challenges on the horizon: disinformation and misinformation turbocharged by artificial intelligence, distrust in mainstream media that leaves outlets less capable of pointing out inaccuracies, and cuts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal agency that helps defend crucial election networks. It is, Norden said, “a toxic brew.” Add in the capture of Maduro and an online MAGA army demanding validation of its theories, and America seems destined for a new bout of feverish conspiracism just in time for the midterms.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot?

For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children.

Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous.

These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed.

Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app.

Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply.

We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond.

We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry.

As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.”

Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.”

At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.”

And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini.

Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions.

Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening.

The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on.

We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences.

But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists.</div>

After an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week, forensic examinations of videos of the incident emerged within hours. These meticulous reconstructions were useful for debunking the lies told by Trump-administration officials in the immediate aftermath of the killing, and they show the power of technology, in an age when nearly everyone has a camera in their pocket, to convey a complicated moment.

Sleuths, amateur and professional, pored over each frame to try to guess what Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good, might have believed or known in the moment about what she was doing or where her car was heading. But at the core of the tragedy is a larger truth: None of this needed to happen. A series of choices by the administration led to this point—the use of ICE and Border Patrol to menace Democratic-led states and cities; White House pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to make high quotas, which has resulted in shortened training and rushed missions; and the president’s inclination to inflame tensions, all of which created the conditions for the moment that’s now been replayed millions of times.

Under Supreme Court precedent, an officer may shoot at someone fleeing if he reasonably believes that his life or the lives of others are in danger. Prosecutors are often slow to charge officers, because they or juries are hesitant to second-guess officers’ determinations. Ross was also reportedly dragged by a car in June during an attempted arrest, which may have made him more likely to assume the worst about a driver. The shooting might ultimately be legally justified. But Ross also placed himself in front of Good’s car. Many policing experts suggest that this wasn’t tactically justified. How about moral justification? Nothing indicated that Good was trying to hurt anyone before officers began running at her; moments before being shot, Good had said that she wasn’t mad at Ross. In the videos, after Ross fires, a man is heard saying, “Fucking bitch.” With the information we have, a moral defense for the killing is nowhere to be found.

There was no need for the huge deployment of federal agents—including a reported 1,500 deportation officers—to Minnesota in the first place. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dispatched ICE agents to the Minneapolis area after the White House, inspired by MAGA media, grabbed onto a sprawling fraud investigation involving Somali immigrants and government aid. By all accounts, this is a real scandal, not a partisan invention; charges were first brought by Joe Biden’s Justice Department. But the scandal also presented an opportunity for political grandstanding (especially because Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was on the ticket against Donald Trump and J. D. Vance in the previous election). The president is using the fraud case as an opportunity to demonize immigrants. “THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” he posted this morning on Truth Social, referring to immigration enforcement in Minnesota. Although DHS does conduct investigations, less obvious is why tactical experts such as Ross were needed on the scene.

Before and after Good’s death, the Trump DHS has sought opportunities to escalate. When citizens called attention to ICE’s presence by making noise and spreading word via social media, DHS falsely claimed that those people were violent rioters. After Good’s death, DHS surged more officers to the area, alleging that the fraud situation merited more agents; officers are now conducting traffic stops and door-to-door operations. But Good’s killing has no obvious connection to fraud, and it does not suggest any elevated threat to officers. Instead, the presence of more officers elevates the threat to civilians, as a Wall Street Journal investigation into ICE traffic stops demonstrates.

Pressure from the White House to meet deportation quotas has meant that ICE agents at best are working hastily and at worst feel unshackled to act with brutality, aware that they are unlikely to face discipline. (Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned today, including the leader of the Somali-fraud investigation, because of the Justice Department’s direction to investigate Good’s widow but not Ross.) This, too, increases the likelihood for mistakes and abuses of power.

The Minnesota actions are, of course, only the latest in a string of similar Trump-administration actions targeting cities that vote Democratic: Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Memphis; Charlotte, North Carolina; New Orleans. The administration has used DHS personnel, the National Guard, and, in L.A., Marines. Trump and his aides have argued that these raids are essential for controlling crime and illegal immigration, but sometimes enforcement seems incidental to performative brutality. In one midnight raid at a Chicago building, for example, the federal government flew a Black Hawk helicopter and turned people out of bed with flash-bang grenades, yet ProPublica found that not a single one of the people arrested was charged with a crime afterward.

Trump ended National Guard deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland late last year, bowing to repeated federal-court rulings, in lawsuits brought by cities and states, that establish that he had exceeded his powers. The first two weeks of January suggest that the administration will simply use DHS to serve the same function of punishing and intimidating cities and states that diverge from Trump politically. Minnesota and Illinois officials sued to block some immigration enforcement yesterday, but because immigration enforcement is a standard federal power, these suits may face longer odds.

Even unfettered, however, the White House is unlikely to achieve its goals of deporting all unauthorized immigrants—in part because they are based on wild overestimates of how many people are in the United States illegally. But Trump and the top aide Stephen Miller’s obsession with the issue means more incidents like Renee Good’s killing. A one-off tragedy is horrifying. What’s worse is when policy choices make it likely to happen again.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

To be an enrolled member of a tribe is almost entirely contingent on “blood quantum”—the percentage of one’s lineage that can be traced to tribal ancestors.

I don’t qualify for enrollment in my tribe. To be enrolled in the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, you need a quantum of one-quarter Minnesota Chippewa Tribe blood, as well as one parent who is an enrolled member. (Chippewa is a French corruption of the original Ojibwe.) Even though my mother grew up on Leech Lake and devoted her life to the tribe, first as a nurse and then as a lawyer and tribal-court judge, her official blood quantum is only one-quarter. Her grandmother was recorded as half Ojibwe, even though she was full, and her father was on the rolls as a quarter when he was really half. I should be enrolled. The fact that I should be but am not turned the idea of Native blood into an obsession for me, at least for a while, because it was a measure of my Indianness that I couldn’t change.

Watch. Black Swan, released 15 years ago, offers a sharp social critique of the pitfalls faced by ambitious women, Faith Hill writes.

Read. Gideon Leek explores the unhappy literary families of the internet age.

New tidbits continue to emerge from The New York Times’ lengthy interview with Trump, and one in particular caught my eye. In my December cover story about how Trump and his allies could seek to subvert the midterm elections, I reported on the danger of the executive branch attempting to seize ballot boxes. This isn’t just catastrophizing: Some Trump allies proposed such a plan after the 2020 election, but it was rejected. In the Times interview, the reporter David Sanger asked Trump about that. “Well, I should have,” Trump replied. Americans should be prepared for him to try again when he has a chance.

            <h2>Texas Sends Plato Back to His Cave</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/texas-censorship-plato-philosophy-sexuality/685597/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thomas Jefferson loathed Plato. In 1814, he wrote to John Adams that he had been reading the Republic and came away unimpressed: “Bringing Plato to the test of reason, take from him his sophisms, futilities, & incomprehensibilities, and what remains?” The only reason the Greek philosopher is so revered, Jefferson opined, is that “education is chiefly in the hands of persons who, from their profession, have an interest in the reputation and the dreams of Plato.”

Even so, Jefferson would have been appalled by what happened last week at Texas A&M University. Days before the spring semester began, Martin Peterson, a philosophy professor, was ordered to remove Plato’s Symposium from the list of assigned readings for the class “Contemporary Moral Issues.” Peterson and Plato fell victim to a policy adopted by the university in the fall, which states that classes cannot “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” without special approval.

In his email response to his department chair, Inside Higher Ed reported, Peterson warned, “You are making Texas A&M famous—but not for the right reasons.” He was right. The case has attracted widespread outrage, including a protest from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. It’s hard to imagine a starker violation of academic freedom than forbidding students to read one of the most famous texts in all of Western philosophy. “Your decision to bar a philosophy professor from teaching Plato is unprecedented,” Peterson protested.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

But although this kind of censorship may be absurd and sinister, it is ironically fitting that Plato, of all philosophers, should be targeted by a regime worried about the effect of subversive ideas on tender minds. Almost 2,500 years ago, Plato’s teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death by the city of Athens for exactly the same reason.

“What do they say? Something of this sort: That Socrates is a doer of evil, and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state.” That is how the charges against him are described in the Apology, one of Plato’s early works, which reports or imagines the speech Socrates delivered in his defense at his trial. He warns his fellow citizens about “the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man.”

The fate of Socrates convinced Plato that the conflict between philosophy and society was inevitable—especially in a democracy, where public opinion is sacred. In the parable of the cave, in the Republic, Plato compares human beings to cave dwellers who never see the sun, but perceive everything by shadowy firelight. Only the philosopher is able to escape the cave and see the way things really are. But when he returns to share what he’s discovered, and tries to get the others to leave the cave too, they laugh at him, or worse: “If they were somehow able to get their hands on and kill the man who attempts to release and lead up, wouldn’t they kill him?” Socrates asks. “No doubt about it,” replies his conversation partner, Glaucon (who in real life was Plato’s older brother).

The Enlightenment began to challenge this pessimistic view in the 18th century. Jefferson was naturally hostile to Plato’s elitism: If all men are created equal, as the Declaration of Independence said, then everyone should be able to understand the truth, once the weight of authority and tradition is lifted from their shoulders.

In the 20th century, the idea that democracy and freedom of thought went hand in hand began to seem doubtful. Leo Strauss, one of Plato’s most important modern interpreters, was a refugee from Nazi Germany, where the banning and burning of subversive books was extremely popular, especially with college students. The idea that seeking the truth was dangerous, that being a philosopher meant courting popular fury, no longer sounded so antique.

In his 1964 book, The City and Man, Strauss wrote that, for Plato, cities are “assemblies of madmen which corrupt most of those fit to become philosophers, and to which those who have succeeded against all odds in becoming philosophers rightly turn their backs in disgust.” This enmity has existed in most times and places, requiring philosophers to exercise what Strauss called “prudence”—that is, to protect themselves by concealing their most explosively unconventional ideas. Strauss believed that many great philosophers had employed “esoteric writing,” only hinting at their true teachings in their published work, to avoid angering the powers that be.

For most of history, the really dangerous philosophical ideas were those that touched on religion and political power. But the Platonic text censored at Texas A&M is not about these subjects, at least not directly. Rather, the Symposium deals with sex and love. Peterson intended to assign the passage in which Plato elaborates on a myth about the origin of erotic love, proposing that human beings were originally created as bodies joined together. Some of these pairs included two men, some two women, and some a man and a woman. But Zeus cut these doubles in half, and ever since our souls have longed to reunite with their lost mate.

This explains why some people are what we now call homosexual: Their souls were originally part of a same-sex pair. Plato writes that if Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, appeared to a male couple and offered “to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live, live a common life as if you were a single man,” the lovers would certainly agree: “This meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need.”

The Symposium’s sympathetic depiction of same-sex desire—at least between men; no female characters take part in the discussion—has long made Plato what we’d now call “queer-coded.” The Victorian writer John Addington Symonds spoke for many a gay reader when he described the thrill of reading Plato for the first time: “Here in the Phaedrus and the Symposium, I discovered the true Liber Amoris [Book of Love] at last, the revelation I had been waiting for.”

Yet the Symposium insists that erotic desire is not really about sex. What we yearn for is not this or that beautiful body, but the beautiful itself, an ideal that can be found only in the spiritual realm. Plato suggests that this is especially true of love between men, which transcends biology because it doesn’t lead to procreation. Symonds said he found in the Symposium “the consecration of a long-cherished idealism.”

Aziz Huq: The next era of the American university

It’s highly unlikely that the Texas A&M regents read Plato before drafting their policy. If they had, they would have discovered that, far from “advocating gender ideology,” he challenges all of our 21st-century ways of thinking about sex and gender. He is neither “left” nor “right,” because he lived thousands of years before those labels were invented. That is one of the reasons studying Greek philosophy has never become obsolete: In every generation, it allows people to escape the binaries of their own time and think things through from the beginning.

The belief that every student is capable of this kind of thinking, and deserves to experience it, was one of the noblest ideals of democratic education. Now that both democracy and education are under threat in the United States, philosophers may have to relearn the “prudence” that once seemed like a relic of history. Peterson is already employing a classic technique of esoteric writing: calling attention to what he is forced to omit. In his revised syllabus, when the students were originally supposed to read Plato, they will now be assigned a New York Times article about why they can’t.</div>

Linux malware is relatively rare, because getting into Linus systems is much harder than the laughably easy ways to get into Windows systems. Hence this much later development. But while LLMs are generally incapable, generating malware and running automated attacks on, let&#39;s say, &quot;low intermediate level&quot; with so-so success rates is something they can do and it can be automated. And that dramatically reduced the effort for attacking Linux systems in a non-targeted fashion. There will be enough incompetent Linux admins out there to make that not worthwhile and hence a versatile software solution for the next step after compromise becomes desirable to attacker for Linux as well.

That should be &quot;make that now worthwhile&quot;. My apologies.

It voids your manufacturers warranty in only 48 states.

Yeah, I keep saying I&#39;m done with slashdot. But for the &quot;editors&quot; to continue allowing garbage like this with straight-up lying headlines... I&#39;m finally done. I deal with enough brainwashed anti-open-source mouth breathers at work. Why do I keep coming back to it here on a so-called tech news website that can&#39;t even get basic facts straight?

Good thing HN has a pretty good signal-to-noise ratio. See you all there!

Looks like I was wrong. As these are essentially a variant of high-temperature (for radiation cooling) RTGs (maybe with criticality added?), not steam-engines, they are much simpler than regular reactors. Still apparently takes a long time to make them work.

Yes. At about 2kW and using Plutonium. Very expensive, very little power.

not 2kw 470 or so at launch now they are about 40watts.

2.4KW thermal power. 470W electrical power.

No, not an RTG but a proper fission reactor as it says in the first line.Tiny at 40kW, but orders or magnitude more power than a passive RTG, or SRG (Stirling Radioisotope Generator)The FSP may use a Stirling engine, or instead a Closed Brayton Cycle, but powered by a fission reactor, not a radioisotope lump.

Unlike the earlier Kilopower design, FSP will use Low-Enriched Uranium.

Some of the designs in the SNAP program were absolutely fission reactors. You don&#39;t get 1 megawatt of electricity out of a radio-thermal design.

In particular snap 10a was a fission reactor we actually launched into space.

Read the pdf. This current program is a complete retread of SNAP.

we are not putting a fission reactor on the moon. it would run for about an hour after it went critical and them melt down. NOTING ON THE MOON TO USE FOR COOLING. Hell we built one in GREENLAND it the 60s and even in Greenland berried under the ice we could not keep it cool. We had all the communist cold war non sense money on the planet and we could not do it. Seriously go look it up.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

If you publicly execute that 1 citizen, it may still work pretty well. Just compare to the effect ICE just had shooting one person.

The US does not care. Trump does not care. He just wants to misdirect away from the Epstein Files.

Indeed. As long as they have honor and integrity, you can work with Republicans. Some of them seem to slowly remember these are traditional conservative values ...

The Ford heckler yelled “pedophile protector” probably referring to Trump&#39;s reluctance to fully release the Epstein files.

Reports say packet losses skyrocketed to 90% (80% in some earlier reports), thus making service unstable.Interesting. You can still get a lot through that, but TCP/IP basically becomes unusable around 50% packet loss. There are tools for tunneling TCP via IP or UDP over very lossy lines, although I think most are older.

For better or worse, Russian signal jamming is the best there is. It&#39;s a core part of their military doctrine, and for good reason, as the Nato doctrine is built on total informational and situational awareness, and it basically cannot function without it on any level.

Noise is something that exists on the receiver. Either they are jamming the sats with their own in orbit, or the terminals on ground with mobile or even stationary gear. While the sats would probably be Russian, these could easily land a hand

For better or worse, Russian signal jamming is the best there is.Better? Can you imagine a scenario where Russian signal jamming is done for the better?

For russians, done for Russian national interest - better. For americans, done against US national interest - worse. Nobody has the high ground on the international stage, everyone is just out to look after their own interests, so what is good or bad depends on which country you identify with.

blocking cia/mi6/mossad violent destabilization of a friendly and strategically critical country would be one, if you&#39;re not usrael or a vassal, that is.

Depends on their abilities for sure, that is, the range and density of the fleet. But certainly more difficult to geofence, yes.

Satellites also have a limited power budget, which makes the whole proposal rather interesting technically, and my take is, unlikely. But while the traditional capabilities of their jamming tech is well known, the newer stuff is obviously secret and there are known gaps in our knowledge of it. So you never know.

Considering the neighbours and relations with them Iran has, both good

Can and must be limited to what is the current satellites over their country or the power needed goes through the roof. Also, since Starlink is a civilian service, it might be cause for a lawsuit (good luck...), but it is in no way an &quot;act of war&quot;.

Other countries are affected.  Russian GPS jamming has been disrupting flights in the Baltic, Med and Black Sea areas: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/art... [bbc.co.uk]

Best there is?  I doubt it. They have never had the best of anything. When told they have the best, we usually find out later it wasn’t true. It’s happened that way so many times, I’m inclined to think that’s the case here.

What they do have is determination, and a willingness to sacrifice bodies during conflicts of all sizes. Which is no small thing for all concerned.

How would a jammer work and what would the range be ?From the article:Starlink receivers use GPS to locate and enable connections to satellites. “Since its 12-day war with Israel last June,&quot; The Times says, “Iran has been disrupting GPS signals.” That means shutdowns are localized, and has resulted in a patchwork quilt of Starlink connectivity, including near blackouts in some high-profile areas.Presumably they saturate the airwaves with bogus GPS data which makes the receiver think it&#39;s somewhere that it&#39;s not.  The receiver then &quot;looks&quot; to the wrong place in the sky when it&#39;s trying to send/receive packets.

Seems like this would be easily defeated in software, by allowing the user to hard-code their GPS coordinates if they know their precise location by other means.

This is an easy answer. It&#39;s not the starlink satellites being disrupted, it&#39;s the receivers. Jam the 14-14.5 GHz frequency, and no more uplink.

And it&#39;s also super easy to disrupt any wireless signal, you just make louder noise on the same frequency. If you overpower the 4 watts of transmission power with 10 watts of noise, then the satellites will only see noise, but why stop there, hit it 50 watts so that nothing reaches it.

That&#39;s why they can&#39;t cut it off entirely, because satellite constellations move.

on the same frequency. If you overpower the 4 watts of transmission power with 10 watts of noise, then the satellites will only see noise, but why stop there, hit it 50 watts so that nothing reaches it.The first part isn&#39;t necessarily true: it depends on the waveform.  A GPS satellite normally broadcasts with something like (depending on how you measure it) 20 W per channel.  From a given user position and for L1, there are often a dozen other GPS satellites, and eight to ten Galileo satellites, broadcasting at basically the same power on the same frequency.  Fewer GPS satellites broadcast on L5 but it&#39;s also crowded; other GNSSes don&#39;t broadcast at L2.  A receiver can still track all of those satellites

GPS signals work on the &#39;edges&#39; of the signal, not the strength of it. That is, you &quot;listen&quot; to some noise at a particular frequency in the required band, but just at the moment you&#39;re expecting it to do so, there&#39;s a &quot;high to low&quot; edge in the noise. You wait a bit more at a different frequency, and then there&#39;s another... and another... gradually, you gain &#39;signal lock&#39; which is essentially your listening expectation matching up with the signal sent by the satellite. You need a pretty accurate clock to be

Just put out a lot of RF noise. Very simple, very cheap, exceptionally &quot;dirty&quot;, but if you are a totalitarian regime, you may not care. Starling signals are very weak. Just significantly raising the noise-floor will kill them.

The one problem is the directional antenna. If you are willing to accept a lot of collateral RF damage, you can just crank up the jamming power. If not, you may have to get to a place somewhat were the antenna points. But remember, there is a lot of high towers in the cities there, and

It appears to be more that the wannabe King is using existing unrest to try and gain power, with the assistance of the Western powers. The unrest would likely be happening without that, although it&#39;s debatable how much sanctions helped cause it. If The Western powers had any integrity or decency at all they would assist those looking to create a Democratic State, but that would be unlikely to have much love for those Western powers so instead they are favouring the wannabe King, who will need to show love t

i doubt there is any love for another palevi either, he&#39;s a joke. the unrest wasn&#39;t really against the government, but against the economic situation demanding the government to address it. the latest demonstrations against the riot violence have greatly surpassed those for economic discontent and, in a way, actually singal solid support for the government. iranians by now have learned that there is nothing good to expect from western democracy, even the younger generations that didn&#39;t even get to know abou

Interesting. From my experience, even with high-gain GPS antennas, GPS is pretty weak and easy to impact. My experiments (part of a war-walk) were 15 years ago though.

I&#39;m waiting for something similar in the USA. You call the president a bad name and he cries to Verizon or AT&T to cancel your service.

The USAF and Navy have the Wild Weasel mission to destroy radar sites. My $0.02 is they have similar capability to take out jammers.

The Guardian article does some job of balancing perspectives. Some of the methodological issues, raised by the people who are questioning the past studies, are acknowledged by some authors of said past studies. This is not a straightforward case, the next few years will tell us more. There&#39;s other reasons to stop or reduce plastic usage anyway, it&#39;s bad for us, this hasn&#39;t changed.

Cross-contamination isn&#39;t the only issue that needs to be controlled for. Some of the analyses performed don&#39;t do a good job of distinguishing microplastics from the animal fats which are naturally present in animal tissue, and some of the papers don&#39;t give any indication of realising that this is a factor that needs to be taken into account when interpreting the analyses. So although it&#39;s indeed no surprise that microplastics are in the human body, the evidence for how much there is is less strong than cla

The actual objection is the studies finding microplastics in human brain tissue are not well controlled. The objection comes from a collection of other researchers who, except for one, all have publishing histories of studying microplastics in the environment and creating lab protocols for creating, handling, and detecting plastic micro/nano particles.

They are NOT saying there are definitely no microplastics accumulating in human tissues.

They ARE saying the original research methods are severely lacking - a

More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarettes.

The brain study that made news last year was the first time I started to have some doubt in these studies. They reported >5000 ug of MNPs per gram of brain tissue. That&#39;s 5 mg/g, or 0.5% by mass. That&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem reasonable. A plastic grocery bag is ~5 g, and the human brain is about 1.3 kg. So 0.5% by mass is the equivalent of more than 1 plastic bag&#39;s worth of plastic in the brain.

That study did perform microscopy and identified what look like inclusions, but their analysis indicated the inclusions

And unlike politics, people will look at these claims and determine whether they have value. Anybody actually understanding Science will wait for those results before making a final judgement.

You promote an anti-science president, your political party engages in a war against science and education.

&quot;Anybody actually understanding Science will wait for those results before making a final judgement.&quot;

I&#39;m someone who is concerned about plastic pollution, and particularly concerned about ingesting it.  I don&#39;t microwave my food in plastic dishes, and I use stainless steel insulated mugs, and I went out of my way to find teabags made without plastic.  But the research results in this area were definitely exaggerated by the media.  Here&#39;s an example:

Now comes word that a device, purchased by the Pentagon, has been tested which may be linked to what is known as Havana Syndrome.&quot;

IMO this does not justify calling it a &quot;Pentagon device&quot; in the headline, causing clickbait-grade implications.

Actually they did.  &#39;Havana Syndrome&#39; (which was actually encountered in several locations around the world including an executive conference center in (IIRC) Switzerland) appears to have been caused by the resonance of multiple ultrasonic devices interacting.  It&#39;s called IntraModulation Distortion, and one of the most likely culprits is the anti-eavesdropping equipment which can broadcast ultrasonic signals at well over 120 decibels. This has been known since at least 2018 but spooks being spooks they pre

This is a very misleading headline based on what the article says. The summary makes it sound like the Pentagon had this device in Havana and their own device caused this syndrome. That&#39;s not the case at all.

The Pentagon purchased the device as part of their investigation, and they tested the device and determined it could be the cause of the injuries and symptoms. It contains Russian components, but that doesn&#39;t mean that Russia deployed it or even made the complete device (although that is likely).

What remains a mystery is how it could be deployed without being detected and located, and why it was wasted on relatively unimportant employees.

And how it supposedly penetrated Faraday cages in poured concrete walls in basement rooms (the original location it was reported).

Agreed.  If the cause was pulsed RF radiation it would have been detected years before this.  The RF spectrum around an embassy is probably one of the most studied and analyzed environments outside an active war zone.  Suggesting that a secretive pulsed RF signal was transmitted toward the embassy without being detected is just imaginative speculation.  Extremely sensitive spectrum analyzers are recording continuously inside and outside the embassies.

Now comes word that a device, purchased by the Pentagon, has been tested which may be linked to what is known as Havana Syndrome.

Maybe maybe not. The Havana Syndrome sufferers didn&#39;t suddenly get better leaving the embassy. Whatever problem they had persisted. It may not be the case of getting sick wherever in the embassy they worked, they may have all gotten sick in one very localised common area that could have been targeted. An obvious target would be the parking lot or the front door since those are open spaces that do less to attenuate radio waves. Not much is known here about what exposure is required for what duration.

Yeah, it&#39;s called IntraModulation Distortion, caused by the interaction of multiple ultrasonic devices resonating.

I clicked at least 5 of those links...none were to the actual current article.

Shame on the submitter and editor here mixing the end of biden administration, 2015, and other random stuff.

Dude just give me the article in question where USA bought a device from SOMEWHERE that looks like it might be the thing that did the thing.

It&#39;s the link in the header [cnn.com], immediately after the pernicious title.

Dude... 6 digit UI, you should know better. Slashdot *ALWAYS* links the primary article in the header.

Tens of millions of dollars to cause some discomfort in your enemy and occasionally get one of them to quit?

Doesn&#39;t seem like an effective use of spending for Russia or Cuba.

Someone just sold it for 8 figures to the DoD. Get Rich Or Die Trying.

Yeah... I doubt the Russians have the capability to make an undetectable beam weapon capable of getting through concrete and faraday cages and probably lead panels etc.

However, the capability to bamboozle some random government person struggling with diffuse health problems by telling them what they wanted to hear and selling them a junk gadget? That is a proven Russian capability. It&#39;s what they do in their free time!

Does it beep?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s legit unless it beeps.

and if someone has used modern components, with more power, and some optimizations to create some radio/ultrasonic gun to point and click.

Havana syndrome doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s a psychosomatic mass hysteria. Havana syndrome hasn&#39;t been &quot;conclusively proven&quot; false, only because it&#39;s virtually impossible to prove a negative. Several scientific bodies looked into it and found it to likely be psychosomatic. Intelligence agencies and the State department looked into it several and determined that it couldn&#39;t possibly just be in their heads and so issued multiple wildly differing theories with little to no evidence in their favor.

After all, physical effects can easily be detected. I mean, I can just run a wire from my $700 oscilloscope, set it to FFT and get everything, including a much higher noise-floor is somebody does UWB. For mechanical, use a small Piezo as converter and do the same thing. Yes, these will not be good measurements, but they are more than enough for detecting anything stronger than the normal noise floor.

Pure magnetic or electrical does not have range. Gravitational cannot be done without huge masses. Weak and s

In April 2010, a state-of-the-art offshore oil rig operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast killed 11 and ignited a fireball so large it could be seen from 40 miles away. For nearly three months, Americans watched as BP (formerly British Petroleum) tried desperately to cap the Macondo well 5,000 feet below the surface. More than 134 million gallons of oil blackened the Gulf from Florida to Texas.

The Deepwater Horizon spill remains one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. More than 15 years later, coastal communities in the Gulf are still recovering from the devastation of their economies and ecosystems. But the passage of time naturally dulls the horror for people farther away.

BP and the Trump administration appear to be counting on that. As the world fixates on Venezuela’s oil reserves, industry and regulators are quietly paving the way for reckless projects much closer to U.S. shores.

Indeed, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon is trying to open its next chapter in the Gulf: a massive new hub for offshore drilling that could give it access to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently reviewing BP’s proposal for Kaskida, among the first of several planned ultra-deep-water oil projects. Although BOEM sent back BP’s initial proposal in August, the company has since resubmitted what the agency has characterized as minor modifications. BOEM now has until March to issue its decision.

The proposal itself is riddled with red flags, demonstrating that BP has not learned from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. It utterly fails to prove that the project could operate safely under the high temperatures and pressures of ultra-deep-water drilling. Instead, it seems the London-based company is hoping that Donald Trump’s obsession with fossil fuels will push it over the finish line.

I helped document the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the lead investigator for the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission. President Barack Obama convened our bipartisan group of science, policy, and industry experts a month after the Macondo blowout began—and a good two months before the industry was able to cap it. As millions of gallons of oil were pumping daily into waters owned by the American public, the president gave us a simple but important job: Figure out what happened so that the oil industry, the federal government, and Gulf communities could ensure it would never happen again.

We wrote an entire book to document our technical findings, but it’s easy to sum up our broader observations: In the decades leading up to the disaster, oil companies had been undertaking riskier and riskier projects even as government safety standards grew increasingly outdated. Industry executives were trusting themselves to the point of willful ignorance. Ambition and shareholder pressure created a culture of complacency in which oil and gas executives convinced themselves that they could do no wrong, despite incidents that should have warned them otherwise.

Executives at BP and every other oil company all told me they never thought that something like the Deepwater blowout could happen. With billions of dollars at stake, they just couldn’t overcome the temptation to drink their own Kool-Aid.

Protecting people, private property, and our public lands from this kind of industry complacency is supposed to be the job of expert, nonpartisan regulators. But in the years leading up to Deepwater Horizon, fossil-friendly politicians of both parties had steadily starved regulatory agencies of resources, authority, and independence.

Scientists and engineers who were supposed to supervise the industry got captured by it instead. They knew that risks were increasing as the wells were getting deeper and more dangerous, but they trusted the oil companies’ assurances. Our report found that by the time of the Deepwater Horizon calamity, federal regulators had been routinely rubber-stamping new ventures into deep water.

The underwater volcano of oil from the Macondo well blew apart BP’s complacency—for a time. The company was forced to reckon with the reality that no one knew how to stop a blowout from a well as big and as deep as Macondo. BP’s drilling proposal for the well should have provided a viable plan for a worst-case scenario, but it didn’t. And overwhelmed and underresourced regulators didn’t respond to that gigantic red flag.

We had a major opportunity to learn from Deepwater Horizon. But other industry players distanced themselves from BP rather than internalize the lessons. When I talked to them, they appeared to be in denial. While I wasn’t entirely shocked when BP executives told me that they never thought a blowout like Macondo could happen on one of their projects, I was stunned when other industry execs insisted that it would not have happened on any of their projects.

None of them recognized that their company’s hubris was just one instance of an industrywide culture of complacency.

The public should expect our government to address this complacency through expert oversight. But 15 years on, and despite the dedicated advocacy of the bipartisan Deepwater Horizon commission and others, Congress has done nothing to address the budgetary and structural problems that plague the agencies tasked with providing it. Congress hasn’t touched the liability limits that enable the industry to gamble with public health. The Department of the Interior did issue modest improvements to drilling regulations in 2016, but it rolled them back during the first Trump administration in what the American Petroleum Institute hailed as a “modernization” effort.

The second Trump administration has been even friendlier to industry. Executive orders have reversed a number of Biden-era offshore restrictions to fast-track permitting and weaken technical requirements (e.g., adjusting various technical constraints to allow drilling under higher pressures and enable more output). The Elon Musk–led DOGE project also shuttered regional offices and fired regulators.

The administration’s quest to accelerate drilling with inadequate regulations and fewer regulators is a recipe for disaster that leaves the industry largely to its own devices. And judging by its half-baked proposals, BP has either forgotten the lessons of what it termed a “catastrophe” or decided that catastrophe is an acceptable risk. After all, the company’s shareholders can still count on the American taxpayer and the communities of the Gulf to bear most of the costs of a spill, just as they did last time.

The proposed Kaskida project is even riskier than Macondo was. It is over 1,000 feet deeper, and drilling overall is becoming more challenging as ever-stronger storms rip across a heating Gulf with ever-increasing regularity. Yet BP’s proposal reveals that the company is not meaningfully better prepared to cap a deep-water well than it was 15 years ago. It took 87 days to cap Deepwater Horizon; according to the BP proposal, it would take 90 to 100 days to stop a spill from Kaskida.

Members of Congress have found even that dismal figure optimistic, concluding that the company underestimates the magnitude of a worst-case scenario at Kaskida by using a questionable methodology. In a scathing letter to BOEM in August, lawmakers urged Acting Director Matthew Giacona to reject the project. They correctly noted that BP’s proposal “fails to meet basic regulatory standards,” including neglecting to show that the company possesses the necessary equipment to contain a high-pressure spill. Under the law, the fact that BP hasn’t met current regulatory standards should be sufficient to deny the application.

Yet it seems that federal agencies have gone from merely failing to regulate the oil industry to actively advocating for it. The first Trump administration saw oil companies as its “partners.” The second Trump administration treats them as its “customers.”

Fossil-fuel giants have, of course, exploited the White House’s “customer service” stance to demand accelerated approval of new oil and gas pipelines and export terminals. They’re scrambling to secure long-term leases to some of the more than 1 billion acres of our public waters that the administration is offering up for drilling. They aim to lock in lengthy property rights and economic advantages that will insulate them from the reality of the inevitable clean-energy transition. That includes a new era of ultra-deep and high-risk drilling in the Gulf.

Kaskida is very much part of this pattern. And it’s just the beginning: BP has already submitted an additional production proposal for another ultra-deep-water project called Tiber, and companies like Chevron and Beacon Offshore Energy have proposed a slew of multibillion-dollar ultra-deep-water projects in the Gulf.

Even as the administration is bending over backward to green-light risky offshore oil projects, it is doing all it can to stop renewable-energy projects that create jobs and deliver gigawatts with far less pollution and climate impact. If BP were proposing to build wind towers instead of drill wells at Kaskida, it wouldn’t have a chance.

The Trump administration and BP are trying to carry on as if nothing has changed since Deepwater Horizon. In some ways, they’re right. The regulations still are not strong enough, the companies aren’t any wiser, and there’s even more oil money in politics.

But some things have changed. Renewable energy has become cheaper and increasingly more reliable than fossil energy, and it is getting more so every day. At the same time, the risks of fossil-fuel extraction are a lot less hypothetical. Every American adult can summon up searing images from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

We know that the oil industry has not operated in good faith, that our regulators aren’t protecting us, and that the American public, particularly Gulf communities, will bear the costs of the next disaster. If we witness another Deepwater Horizon, no one will be in a position to plead ignorance.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

It’s perhaps inevitable that there are already several online fundraisers for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week. Conservative social media users often rally to financially defend anyone perceived as a member of their team, regardless of how unpalatable their actions might be. One GoFundMe for the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has already raised more than $439,000, $10,000 of which came from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who argued that everyone deserves a hearty defense.

But there was one specific fundraiser that betrayed just how careless the right has become in its tribalist impulses. On GiveSendGo, the “Christian” alternative to GoFundMe, the primary fundraising post for Ross is explicitly white supremacist in nature.

GiveSendGo was built as a kind of conservative, faith-based alternative to GoFundMe, and it has crowdfunded small fortunes for plenty of conservative heroes accused of violent or bigoted actions. For example, it hosted a campaign that raised $836,000 for Shiloh Hendrix, the white mother who called a child on a playground the N-word. It is also where Kyle Rittenhouse raised more than $586,000 for his defense after he killed two men in 2020. Many Jan. 6 insurrectionists—even those who assaulted police officers in their efforts to overturn the election—turned to this platform when they wanted help.

But the site’s Ross fundraiser, which has raised more than $171,000, reveals an even darker side of these crowdfunding efforts.

Titled “Stand With Our Brave ICE Hero,” the fundraiser is a legitimate campaign connected to the agent. It has been shared by Jacob Wells, a co-founder of GiveSendGo, who has personally vouched, on social media, that the funds will go to Ross. It was boosted by major conservative accounts, as well as the right-wing news outlet Alpha News, which was the first publication to share video from Ross’ perspective of the Minneapolis encounter.

But skim to the third paragraph of its description of the event, and you’ll see—or would have seen, as the page has since been edited—a rather odd description of the situation: “This didn’t happen in a vacuum—it’s the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance.”

In case that reference to Frey’s religion isn’t enough, there are other tells about this particular fundraiser’s specific white supremacist leanings. The fundraiser’s URL is www.givesendgo.com/Theyallmustgo. Then there’s the opener, addressing “America First patriots”—a signal, often, to the more white supremacist element of the right. The text also speaks of “illegal aliens … flooding our nation … and threatening our sovereignty” and of efforts to “purge … parasites from our soil,” dehumanizing rhetoric that evokes Great Replacement conspiracy theories.

But we don’t actually need to decipher the language here, because the man who created the account is an avowed white supremacist who has no desire to hide his views. On X, the man—who goes by Tom Hennessey, it’s unclear if that is his real name—defended the killing by asking if Good was a “negrophile” and arguing that “American stormtroopers … should be able to use extraordinary violence on our behalf.” He celebrates whiteness on his account, argues for the protection of “White American bloodlines,” and promotes the idea that Jews ruin white nations by “flooding” them with immigrants.

It’s not clear if he has any direct connection to Ross, but this isn’t his first fundraiser. In November, Hennessey set up a GoFundMe page for a 20-year-old Mississippi State University student who yelled “Fuck the Jews” at Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. (The page said that Jewish complaints about “hate speech” were weaponized to get “the goyim get locked up.”) And in December, Hennessey set up another page, this time for Crystal Wilsey, a woman who repeatedly used the N-word at a Somali American couple and declared herself to be “a racist.” In fact, the ICE agent page was admittedly out of character for Hennessey, as it didn’t involve an explicitly racist incident. But it did establish this as, at minimum, a hobby for him.

The people who donated to this GoFundMe, or those who just expressed interest, such as Megyn Kelly, may not have all read the page or clocked its white supremacist origins. It has since been edited to remove the reference to Frey’s Judaism; it has not been toned down that much overall. But this incident shows the carelessness behind right-wing solidarity. Ross’ supporters, acting on a kind of anti-left impulse, may think they’re helping their movement by supporting patriots. They are also exposing overt hatred at the core of the anti-immigrant movement.

            <div id="article-text">The AI-driven datacenter construction frenzy shows no signs of slowing, but neither do concerns that the whole edifice could collapse under the weight of its own hype and mounting investment demands.

Moody&#39;s 2026 Outlook report on the global datacenter market, seen by The Register, forecasts business as usual, with demand for server farm capacity continuing to rise in support of AI, cloud computing, and internet services.

The financial services biz estimates at least $3 trillion in investment is required to keep pace with the projected level of capacity expansion between now and the end of the decade. This covers the cost of buildings, the IT infrastructure, and the power required to keep the lights on.

However, the report flags worries over power grid constraints and construction bottlenecks, warning that demonstrating actual revenue generation will become &quot;increasingly important in the AI ecosystem&quot; to silence growing chatter about an &quot;AI bubble.&quot;

Question marks over sustainability are hardly new. McKinsey & Company warned in May 2025 that huge sums are being invested in AI on demand forecasts amounting to little more than educated guesswork.

MIT researchers claimed 95 percent of enterprise organizations had seen no return from their AI efforts so far, and Moody&#39;s itself says circular deals involving companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are spooking investors.

Capital spending by six hyperscalers in the US – Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave – approached $400 billion in 2025 and is on track to hit $500 billion in 2026, then $600 billion in 2027. A chart in Moody&#39;s report shows total global investment peaking in 2029, before declining in 2030.

New datacenter development faces growing headwinds, primarily access to power in most markets, with utilities and power generators hard pressed to meet unexpected electricity demand surges.

Moody&#39;s also notes that local opposition to new builds has increased in some markets, often due to public concerns about their consumption of electricity and water, plus the impact on utility bills.

However, regions with &quot;supportive laws&quot; will continue to attract development, with some governments tweaking regulatory frameworks to encourage AI datacenters. The UK announced &quot;AI Growth Zones&quot; with streamlined planning processes last year.

As the risks mount, developers are coming under growing pressure from clients to shorten construction schedules so that hyperscale tenants can add new capacity as soon as possible.

But this collides with issues including high demand for skilled labor, building materials, and essential equipment, driving up construction costs.

Some tenants are now willing to shoulder delivery risks they previously avoided, including exempting power and utilities availability from completion requirements, the report claims.

On those circular deals, Moody&#39;s notes that OpenAI has signed sizeable contracts for gigawatts of new datacenter capacity and other assets while attempting to grow its revenue base.

Most financing for these assets relies on long-term leases with hyperscalers like Microsoft or Oracle, but &quot;OpenAI&#39;s growing presence in the AI ecosystem poses a growing credit risk depending on its success,&quot; the report states.

OpenAI suffered a net loss of $11.5 billion or more during the quarter to September 30, 2025, as The Register reported. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The latest Firefox is here with some handy changes – most of which differ depending on what OS and type of CPU you run it on.

We suspect that the most visible feature in Firefox 147 is improved Picture-in-Picture video playback. Now it can be triggered automatically when a tab is sent into the background.

PIP video appeared some years ago in Firefox 71 on Windows and Firefox 72 on Linux and macOS. The Reg FOSS desk just turns it off as we are not big fans of internet video, and videos that follow you as you move away from the page hosting them are the absolute last thing we want. Still, some folks will like this – including Daniele Ferla, who developed and contributed the code.

The other thing we suspect will benefit everyone on all platforms, at least occasionally, is that the Tabs page of the Settings screen has been reorganized, and now the various preferences that you can adjust there are categorized as Opening, Interaction, and Closing.

Firefox 147&#39;s most visible change: the Tabs Settings have been split into categories

For Mac types with Apple Silicon ARM64 processors, this release has improved support for the cross-platform WebGPU standard, which first appeared six months ago in Firefox 141. WebGPU, which originated at Apple about nine years ago, lets apps running inside a web page – technically, inside an HTML5 <canvas></canvas> element – use hardware-accelerated 3D via backends such as Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D, and it&#39;s intended as a replacement for the older WebGL standard.

PC folks aren&#39;t neglected either. Users with AMD GPUs now get zero-copy hardware-assisted video playback, bringing Firefox&#39;s AMD GPU support up to par with that for Intel and Nvidia GPUs. On Linux, Firefox now supports the XDG Base Directory Specification. Among other bug fixes, including sharper image rendering for those using Mutter on GNOME, there are multiple security fixes too.

Support for Google&#39;s Safe Browsing standard now covers version 5 of the spec, including the new Local List mode. If you have Firefox&#39;s Enhanced Tracking Protection set to Strict, this now restricts local device access as well as the public internet – although this is being rolled out gradually, so don&#39;t panic if you don&#39;t see it yet.

Back in August, we reported that some users were reporting their Firefox browser was scoffing CPU power, and we told you how to disable the new AI features in the most thorough way: go to the hidden settings screen by entering a URL of about:config and search for browser.ml. We turned off absolutely all the options we could find, and that seemed to silence the automatic plagiarism machine. We&#39;ve seen reports of people finding these settings mysteriously getting re-enabled when they update Firefox. It hasn&#39;t happened to us, but you might want to check anyway.

As usual, there is also a detailed doc describing what&#39;s new for developers. Mozilla publishes full system requirements, but nothing looks different there: you need Windows 10 or macOS 10.15, or of course more recent versions, and a fairly recent Linux.

A new version of Thunderbird will be along to match soon, although as we write, we&#39;re not being offered an update yet – but the release notes are already available. We don&#39;t see any exciting changes here – in fact, only two things are listed under &quot;What&#39;s new&quot; – a Show Full Path option and optional folder-name localization. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two hospitals in Belgium have cancelled surgeries and transferred critical patients to other facilities after shutting down servers following a cyberattack.

AZ Monica, which operates hospitals in Antwerp and Deurne, confirmed the issues on Tuesday.

It said seven patients receiving critical care had to be transferred to different nearby hospitals with help from the Red Cross so they could continue receiving the necessary treatement. All other patients continue to be treated at the affected sites.

Its emergency department was operating at reduced capacity as of Tuesday, the day of the organization&#39;s last official update. According to De Tijd, 70 surgeries were cancelled on the day.

The local news outlet also reported that disruption was expected to continue into Wednesday, January 14, although nothing official has been publicly communicated by the hospital network.

The Register contacted AZ Monica for additional information.

In its Tuesday update, the organization stated that the Mobile Urgency Group (MUG) and Paraprofessional Intervention Team (PIT) services are temporarily unavailable.

MUGs are comprised of clinicians and nurses who travel to the scene of an incident to provide medical care, while PITs provide emergency care en route to a hospital.

&quot;AZ Monica&#39;s focus remains on the safety and continuity of care for our patients,&quot; it said.

&quot;AZ Monica continues to closely monitor the situation and will communicate further updates as soon as more clarity becomes available.&quot;

In a separate advice sheet, the healthcare organization told patients to expect longer-than-usual registration times when visiting the affected hospitals, although the visitation of patients already admitted is unaffected.

Those seeking urgent medical attention were instructed to first consult with their general practitioner, out-of-hours clinic, or other emergency service where available, since AZ Monica&#39;s emergency departments are operating at low capacity. No patients are currently being transported there by ambulance. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Eurail has confirmed customer information was stolen in a data breach, according to notification emails sent out this week.

The European travel company, also known as Interrail to EU residents, initially posted the news on January 10, but affected customers, the number of whom was not disclosed, began receiving emails on January 13.

While the company&#39;s investigation is ongoing, it revealed the data potentially affected includes:

Customers who purchased a travel pass directly from Eurail/Interrail did not have a visual copy of their passports stored on company systems.

However, the same is not true for those who received a pass through the DiscoverEU program, an Erasmus-funded initiative that invites travelers to explore the EU by rail.

The European Commission published a separate notice about the Eurail breach, saying that in addition to the data specified in the company&#39;s email, DiscoverEU travelers may also have photocopies of their IDs, bank account reference numbers, and health data compromised.

&quot;To our knowledge, there is currently no evidence that the data has been misused or publicly disclosed,&quot; it stated. &quot;Eurail reassured the Commission that this is consistently being monitored by external cybersecurity specialists.

&quot;However, as a result of this incident, possible consequences for you may include: phishing and spoofing attempts, unauthorized access, and identity theft.&quot;

Eurail promised the Commission it has secured the affected systems and &quot;closed the vulnerability,&quot; as well as reset credentials and enhanced its security controls following the breach.

Additionally, the Utrecht-headquartered company confirmed the breach was reported to the Dutch data protection authority, as required by GDPR.

Eurail said: &quot;Customers whose data may have been accessed will be informed directly. We take the security of our customers&#39; information seriously and regret any concern this incident may cause.&quot;

The emails sent to affected customers, seen by The Register, include details about how to spot potential scams that use data stolen during the attack, and advise users to change their passwords for all accounts, not just the one used for the Rail Planner app. ®

            <h2>UK backtracks on digital ID requirement for right to work</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/uk_digital_id_climbdown/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government has backed down from making digital ID mandatory for proof of a right to work in the country, adding to confusion over the scheme&#39;s cost and purpose.

In September last year, the government said that from 2029, digital ID would be mandatory for proving a person&#39;s right to work in the UK, but voluntary in other cases.

At the time, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: &quot;You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It&#39;s as simple as that.&quot;

However, the scheme will now become less focused on immigration and put more emphasis on access to public services across the population, according to reports.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Radio 4&#39;s Today program: &quot;The digital ID could be one way in which you prove your eligibility to work through a digital right-to-work check.&quot;

She added that the government planned to operate a system of mandatory digital right-to-work checks.

The latest climbdown was welcomed by campaigners but adds to the argument that the scheme – which might have cost as much as £1.8 billion – will fail to pay back the money invested in it.

Big Brother Watch director Silkie Carlo said the scheme was intrusive, expensive and unnecessary.

&quot;The case for the government now dropping digital IDs entirely is overwhelming. Taxpayers should not be footing a £1.8 billion bill for a digital ID scheme that is frankly pointless. The proposal to make right-to-work checks digital could raise similar cybersecurity, fraud and privacy risks that digital IDs carry. The devil will be in the detail but this whole digital ID debacle smacks of incompetence,&quot; she said.

As well as the scheme&#39;s purpose, questions remain about how it will be funded.

Last year, minister for digital government and data Ian Murray said the technical delivery would be managed by the Government Digital Service (GDS), within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). However, other departments would have to contribute to the scheme as they adopt its use cases.

He told a Parliamentary select committee: &quot;The cost of the entire system will depend on what the system looks like. Digital inclusion, all the bits that are attached to digital ID, and also the use cases from other government departments in terms of both the cost of having the system, the cost of running the system, and the savings that are subsequently made from having a much more efficient system.&quot;

Members of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee met this view with some skepticism, pointing out that cash-strapped departments might struggle to justify their contribution.

The Register has contacted DSIT for a response.

In a statement to the media, a government spokesperson said: &quot;We are committed to mandatory digital right-to-work checks. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly.&quot;

&quot;Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.&quot;

The government is also developing related digital services that have yet to meet expectations, including the UK One Login system, a unified account system for accessing government services, replacing over 190 separate login systems. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Science, Innovation and Technology Committee has criticized the UK government&#39;s handling of AI nudification tools, saying it is taking too long to ban apps, and that expedited legislation does not encompass multi-purpose platforms used to create nude images.

Grok, the AI chatbot owned and run by Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, caused controversy at the start of this year when users prompted it to create images of naked or barely dressed people – mostly women, some underage – from real photos. Over a 24-hour period between January 5 and 6, it generated 6,700 sexualized images every hour.

Regulators in the UK subsequently launched a probe and the government came under pressure to penalize X, formerly Twitter. Comms watchdog Ofcom, which polices the Online Safety Act (OSA), is now formally investigating the social media platform, which was bought by xAI in March 2025. Grok&#39;s nudity capabilities are still switched on for paying users.

Today&#39;s comments from Dame Chi Onwurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, are in response to a letter from technology minister Liz Kendall, who tried to assure her that the government is tackling the issue.

Kendall said in her letter to Dame Onwurah, dated January 12 but made public this morning: &quot;xAI&#39;s action to restrict this ability to paying users is a further insult to victims, effectively monetizing this horrific crime.&quot;

She said the OSA was built to deal with this situation and &quot;intimate image abuse has been designated a &#39;priority offence,&#39;&quot; adding: &quot;Ofcom has the mandate it needs to hold services to account for horrific illegal content on their sites and they have the government&#39;s unequivocal backing to use the full force of the powers that Parliament has granted them, up to and including, if they deem necessary, the power to apply to the courts to block services from being accessed in the UK if they refuse to comply with UK law.&quot;

The government is also banning nudification tools, and Kendall said: &quot;We will bring forward this legislation as a priority, making amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill going through Parliament now.&quot;

Dame Onwurah responded, saying &quot;significant questions remain&quot; about the approach being taken, and asking why it has taken &quot;so long&quot; to introduce the nudification ban &quot;when reports of these disturbing Grok deepfakes appeared in August 2025.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s also unclear whether this ban – which appears to be limited to apps that have the sole function of generating nude images – will cover multi-purpose tools like Grok.&quot;

Kendall also said if there are &quot;gaps&quot; in the OSA, the government will address them. To this, Dame Onwurah said: &quot;This comes months after rejecting the committee&#39;s recommendations to explicitly regulate generative AI and put greater responsibility on platforms like X and Grok. I urge the government to adopt our recommendations and embed core principles – such as responsibility and transparency – into the online safety regime. These are essential principles to build a strong regulatory framework that protects users online.&quot;

The Register has asked X to respond. Instead of a poop emoji, which is what X used to send journalists contacting it for comment, these days the automated messages states &quot;Legacy Media Lies.&quot; We&#39;re hoping it sends us a specific statement on the matters above. ®

            <div id="article-text">The Level 2 driver assist system will exclusively be sold as a $99-a-month subscription.

The Level 2 driver assist system will exclusively be sold as a $99-a-month subscription.

As its sales continue to slip and its robotaxi strategy seems to falter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said today that the company would stop selling its Full Self-Driving feature as a standalone package. Instead, starting on February 14th, the Level 2 driver assist system would be offered as a monthly subscription only.

The news marks a massive shift in how Tesla markets FSD, a software system that Musk has long claimed would lead to fully autonomous vehicles and thus would be an “appreciating asset.” At one time, FSD was sold for $15,000 as a one-time option. That price has since fallen to $8,000, or as a $99-a-month subscription.

Musk didn’t offer any rational for the move, which comes about two weeks before Tesla is expected to announce its fourth quarter and full-year 2025 earnings. The company’s Q4 delivery report revealed a year over year sales drop of 15.6 percent. Growing FSD’ subscription base was a key condition of Musk’s recently approved pay package: he will need to add 10 million active subscribers in order to receive compensation that could be worth $1 trillion.

In the early years, Musk urged Tesla customers to buy the FSD package while they can, because as the software improved the price would assuredly go up. He promised that eventually FSD would get so good Tesla owners would be able to earn passive income on their vehicles as part of a fully autonomous robotaxi service. Musk was right about the price, but only briefly: the cost of FSD peaked in 2022 when it was raised to $15,000, but later fell to $12,000, and eventually $8,000.

And the robotaxis? Well, that’s a work in progress. Last year, Musk predicted that 50 percent of the US population will have access to Tesla’s robotaxis by the end of 2025. So far, only a handful of company-owned vehicles are available in Austin and San Francisco to a limited number of customers. Those vehicles feature safety drivers in the driver or passenger seats, with access to a kill switch if anything goes wrong — a fallback that Waymo’s robotaxis don’t have.

Tesla hasn’t said how many customers currently subscribe to FSD. Older Tesla vehicles with less capable computers will need to be retrofitted to take advantage of FSD’s current capabilities, a process that Musk acknowledged will be costly and “painful.”

Tesla has also come under fire for the way it markets FSD. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles recently ruled that the company is misleading customers and violating state law by selling the system as “Full Self-Driving” when drivers are required to supervise the system.

            <div id="article-text">The Japanese automaker confirmed that production of the all-electric Acura RSX will start in the second half of 2026, followed by Honda Zero SUV.

The Japanese automaker confirmed that production of the all-electric Acura RSX will start in the second half of 2026, followed by Honda Zero SUV.

Honda announced that the next-generation Acura RDX will be the brand’s first SUV to feature a two-motor hybrid system. While this next-gen platform is under development, Honda said it would suspend production of the current RDX, which launched in 2018 and has sold nearly 740,000 units in the US.

Honda confirmed that current RDX production will end this year, followed by a pause before the next-generation model arrives. Exactly when that will be, Honda wouldn’t say. But in the meantime, Honda said that production of the new all-electric Acura RSX remains on track for the second half of this year, followed by the Honda Zero SUV.

Honda confirmed that current RDX production will end this year

The Acura RSX is being positioned as the brand’s first fully homegrown EV that’s slated to be produced in the second half of this year at Honda’s newly acquired Ohio factory. It will feature dual-motor all-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension, Brembo brakes, and the new ASIMO operating system. Honda recently bought out its partner LG Energy’s portion of the Ohio factory to acquire full control of the facility. The factory has been upgraded to allow gas, hybrid, and EV models to be built on the same production line, slated to begin later this year.

But not all of Honda’s EV dreams are coming to fruition. The automaker has already cancelled the Acura ZDX, which is built on GM’s EV platform, after just one year in production. And production of the Zero series Saloon was delayed until 2027.

As EV demand cools after the expiration of the federal tax credit, automakers across the globe are scrambling to add more hybrid models to their lineups. Honda said that these policy rollbacks also required strategy changes to better align its portfolio with customer demand for hybrids and gas-powered vehicles “rather than structuring the business solely around EV mandates,” said Lance Woelfer, VP of automobile sales at Honda. (Woelfer’s use of the term “EV mandate” closely echoes President Donald Trump’s false assertion that the Biden administration’s tax policies and emissions rules forced Americans to buy EVs against their will.)

Honda is also making moves in the outdoor adventure segment with the introduction of the new Base Station towable RV. The automaker showed off a prototype version of the RV, with rooftop solar panels and an exterior illuminated light ring along the edge. The Base Station was developed by the same team that designed the Motocompacto electric scooter — and if you look closely you can see a lot of aesthetic similarities.

Woelfer explained that many existing RV designs are outdated, creating a clear opportunity for disruption. The Base Station is designed to be lightweight enough to be towed by compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V as well as EVs such as the Honda Prologue and the upcoming Honda Zero Series SUV.

Setup is designed to take only a few minutes, including raising the roof to provide 7 feet of interior height. The Base Station features a modular architecture, allowing customers to customize it with accessories such as a kitchen module, shower, or air-conditioning unit. The exterior programmable light ring helps with campsite setup after dark. Inside, the Base Station can sleep up to four people, with a standard queen-size bed and an optional bunk bed. And its compact enough to fit in most residential garages.

DLSS 4.5 is now officially available for all RTX GPU owners.

Nvidia is rolling out a new app update today that includes its latest DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution and Nvidia Surround settings. DLSS 4.5 includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model, designed to improve image quality and reduce the artifacting found in DLSS 4.

While DLSS 4.5 was available in the beta version of the Nvidia app earlier this month, today’s rollout brings the latest model to all RTX owners. The updated model has been trained on an expanded dataset and should significantly improve image clarity and stability when using DLSS Performance or Ultra Performance modes.

DLSS 4.5 also includes new 6x Multi Frame Generation and Dynamic Multi Frame Generation modes for RTX 50-series GPUs, but these features won’t be available until spring 2026.

Today’s Nvidia app update (version 11.0.6) also includes all the remaining Nvidia Surround settings from the older Control Panel, with bezel correction and hotkeys now available. Nvidia has been gradually migrating all of its Control Panel features into the Nvidia app over the past couple of years, in order to merge its Control Panel and GeForce Experience into a single app.

You can get the latest Nvidia app by simply letting it automatically update today, or by manually downloading the update over at Nvidia’s website. You’ll also need Nvidia’s latest Game Ready driver to enable DLSS 4.5.

﻿The Instax Mini Link Plus and Mini Evo Cinema camera will be available in the US next month.

Fujifilm is launching a new Instax Mini smartphone printer that produces finer details than its predecessors. The Instax Mini Link Plus features enhanced image processing compared to older Instax printers, and a similar industrial design to the Instax Mini Evo Cinema camera announced last week, which Fujifilm has now also revealed pricing for.

The Instax Mini Evo Cinema camera will be expensive for an Instax at $409.95, while the Mini Link Plus printer will cost $169.95. The Mini Evo Cinema camera, Mini Link Plus smartphone printer, and the updated Instax Mini Link smartphone app will be available in the US sometime in early February 2026.

The Instax Mini Link Plus features a new “Design Print” mode that focuses on fine details within the images it’s printing. This mode utilizes the printer’s improved image processing capabilities to more clearly reproduce small text and patterns, allowing users to print graphically detailed designs or preserve the legibility of signs and background text in their photographs.

It also provides a “Simple Print” mode for images with fewer details, and uses the same Instax Mini film as the $99 Instax Mini Link 3. That makes the Mini Link Plus a pricey upgrade, but one that may appeal to creatives like graphic designers and photographers who want to preserve finer details in their instant prints.

As for the Mini Evo Cinema camera, it can take photos and wirelessly print images from your phone. It can also capture video clips up to 15 seconds long, and allows users to apply 10 different vintage-style effects, including grainy, pale tones inspired by the 1930s or vibrant colors from the 1980s, using the built-in Gen Dial (also called the “Eras Dial” on the Japanese model).

            <div id="article-text">Copilot invented a nonexistent football match that was included in an intelligence report.

Copilot invented a nonexistent football match that was included in an intelligence report.

The chief constable of one of Britain’s largest police forces has admitted that Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant made a mistake in a football (soccer) intelligence report. The report, which led to Israeli football fans being banned from a match last year, included a nonexistent match between West Ham and Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Copilot hallucinated the game and West Midlands Police included the error in its intelligence report without fact checking it. “On Friday afternoon I became aware that the erroneous result concerning the West Ham v Maccabi Tel Aviv match arose as result of a use of Microsoft Co Pilot [sic],” says Craig Guildford, chief constable of West Midlands Police, in a letter to the Home Affairs Committee earlier this week. Guildford previously denied in December that the West Midlands Police had used AI to prepare the report, blaming “social media scraping” for the error.

Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were banned from a Europa League match against Aston Villa in November last year, because the Birmingham Safety Advisory Group deemed the match “high risk” after “violent clashes and hate crime offences” at a previous Maccabi match in Amsterdam.

As Microsoft warns at the bottom of its Copilot interface, “Copilot may make mistakes.” This is a pretty high-profile mistake, though. We tested Copilot recently, and my colleague Antonio G. Di Benedetto found that Microsoft’s AI assistant often “got things wrong” and “made stuff up.”

We’ve reached out to Microsoft to comment on why Copilot made up a football match that never existed, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.

﻿A political comms professional breaks down Trump’s meme media strategy.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the technology, broligarchs and brainrot rapidly transforming politics and civic society. Not subscribed to The Verge yet? You should! It can materially improve your life.

Last week was a grim reminder that no matter what sort of horror is being perpetrated or how many people end up dead, the Trump administration’s knee-jerk response is to shitpost through it. The White House’s response on X to abducting the head of a sovereign nation? “FAFO”. The response to an ICE agent shooting a woman in broad daylight? A Buzzfeed-style listicle of “57 Times Sick, Unhinged Democrats Declared War on Law Enforcement.” ICE agents arresting protesters? “Welcome to the Find Out stage.”

To the vast majority of people following current events, the Trump administration’s meme-ing is blunt and cruel. But the jaded political insider will also view Trump’s meme fusillade as an element of a media strategy known as “rapid response”: the full-time work of quickly shaping the political narrative of a breaking news event, sometimes within minutes, before the news media and your opponents can shape it for you.

“Every political office, every political campaign, has a dedicated operation that helps them respond strategically to events in the news that are out of their control.” Lis Smith, a high-profile Democratic communications strategist based in New York City, told me. It’s a profession that dates back to the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle, when cable shows could quickly assemble a panel of pundits to discuss current events, and the workload has grown exponentially in the age of social media. “You cannot control all the narratives that are going to be out there, so you need to be able to manage the chaos that’s coming into your world.”

Smith served as the director of rapid response for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign, which was one of the first to fully take advantage of social media, and worked in the comms shop for several New York City mayors and Democratic candidates. She’s widely credited for single-handedly elevating Pete Buttigieg’s profile, turning him from an obscure mayor to a serious presidential candidate as his director of communications. She views social networks through the lens of their messaging utility: X, formerly known as Twitter, is still the best for getting “text-based rapid response communications like written statements” in front of a wide range of “elites and opinion-shapers.” A Bluesky-based messaging strategy might engage a friendly left-leaning audience, but will never “penetrate” the world outside, nor will a Rumble-based campaign ever make it out of the right-wing bubble.

More importantly: memes may be a fast way to convey a political message to a specific audience who gets the inside joke, but the humor is rarely understood by anyone outside of that group — especially people who might have been sympathetic to the concept of stopping illegal immigration, but are horrified by how the Trump administration is going about it. The memes themselves are simply a reflection of that mindset. “The administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate,” said Smith. “It takes the humanity, the seriousness, and the nuance that’s needed out of it and replaces it just with cruelty.”

Before we get to my conversation with Smith, here’s The Verge’s latest on the political tech dystopia:

This interview has been edited for clarity.

You came up during an era where Twitter, before it was X, was really the only internet media environment for politics. How has the practice of rapid response changed in an environment where there is so much narrative to control over so many types of media?

It’s gotten a lot harder. In the ’90s, the big change was the 24-hour news cycle with cable news. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the big development was social media, Twitter, and being able to respond in real time online to news developments. But now, there’s no question that it’s harder to get your message out, with how fractured these different social media channels are. Not everyone is on X today the same way they were 10 years ago. But also, your message is less likely to penetrate as effectively on a platform like X than it was 10 years ago, because of how verification, etc., have changed.

So you really need to have an “all of the above” communication strategy, where you’re hitting traditional media with press releases, calls to reporters and news networks, and you’re also hitting social media in real time. That means not just hitting X, but also hitting Threads, hitting Bluesky, TikTok, Instagram, all those apps, because there has never been a time where people’s media consumption habits have been more fractured than right now.

Do candidates view specific platforms for certain political purposes, or political leanings?

X is still pretty dominant in American politics for getting out rapid response communications, especially text-based rapid response communications like written statements, because it’s still where you’re going to find the most political insiders, political pundits, and reporters. Everything [messaging-wise] trickles out from there. Where you see more fracturing is in terms of where people do short form video: you do see some campaigns using TikTok, others using Instagram more; you do see some favoring of different platforms across partisan lines. But Bluesky on the left is just never going to be as effective of a way of reaching elites and opinion-makers as X is — just as Truth Social or Discord on the right is never going to be the way that you reach elites or opinion-makers.

Let’s go into the content of said messaging. I know that Kamala Harris and Biden tried to lean into memes during their 2024 campaigns, but clearly not as effectively as Trump, and the meme format seems to be really dominant in the Trump administration. Is there a specific way an operative views the meme format as a political messaging tool?

The meme format is more likely to spread quickly. It’s something that a specific audience is going to understand immediately, and it really simplifies a political argument. The problem with that, though, is, one, it’s very audience specific. Not everyone is going to understand a Family Guy meme, not everyone is going to understand a Patriots meme, or whatever the meme du jour is.

Another problem with the meme format is that you lose a lot of context and you lose a lot of humanity in it. So when you see the administration posting sort-of-funny memes about deportations or ICE, you lose a lot of the empathy and compassion that most people have when it comes to the immigration debate. Most people think that illegal immigration is bad and that we should do something about it. But most people also understand that there are real people who are involved in all of these situations and don’t think it’s funny to make light of, say, school pickups getting raided, or families getting separated, or parents crying as they’re being dragged away from their kids.

I was listening to Joe Rogan interviewing Shane Gillis, and they actually touched on this. I would say both Rogan and Shane Gillis are people who were favorable to Trump in the election — Rogan more so than Shane Gillis — but Gillis said, I want our government to take the issue of illegal immigration seriously. I don’t want it to be funny to them. And I think that’s something that really taps into how most people feel about these issues.

If you reduce these very serious issues to cruel, funny memes, you’re going to alienate a lot of people who might be there with you on an issue if you’d approached it with a little bit more maturity and humanity. But the administration is saying, cut out the humanity, cut out the maturity. Those things don’t matter. Because a viral meme — a meme that is funny or cruel — will probably spread faster than anything with nuance. They’re prioritizing speed and virality over nuance and seriousness.

I think you just refined what we’ve been thinking about at The Verge: the way that my coworkers saw Trump’s abduction of Maduro and their response to the ICE shooting was that this government’s policy is a meme mentality — their speed, virality and the need to get their spin out first before anyone feels any sort of way about it.

There’s a short window when people — everyone from reporters to voters to anyone online — are trying to figure out what the hell’s going on and what they think about breaking news. Rapid response is about stepping into that void and shaping it, but there are real problems with how the Trump administration is doing it. Ultimately, yes, they may win some sort of short-term viral meme war. But in the long term, the way that they’re communicating about these issues — whether it’s the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, or deportations in general — they’re gonna lose the political debate. People want action on these issues, but they don’t want wanton cruelty.

Also, if you [the administration[ step in very quickly and put out bad facts, what you do is just compound mistrust in government and mistrust in the administration. And it’s possible that the Trump administration benefits from that because the less people trust official sources, the more it’s good for them. But I think overall, it’s pretty bad that they’re putting out false information that goes mega-viral the way they do it, because ultimately, no one’s going to take anything they say at face value anymore. It’s especially damaging for their relationships with the news media and elites who, in the past, would have clearly taken what any presidential administration said at face value.

Is it too early to think about meme warfare in the midterm election — changing people’s opinions who could be swayed to vote one way or another, getting that messaging to them as quickly as possible, driving them out to the polls?

I don’t think that the meme strategy from this administration is gonna help Republicans in the midterms. And I think if you talk to a lot of Republicans who are up in swing areas or swing states or certain districts, and you presented them with the memes this administration is putting out, I don’t think they would agree with them, and I don’t think that they would say that this is good political strategy. Because to the point I made earlier: the administration’s use of memes really flattens the political debate. It takes the humanity, the seriousness, the nuance that’s needed out of it, and replaces it just with cruelty. The voters who are going to turn out in 2026 — yeah, some of them are going to be part of that MAGA base that it embraces the cruelty, but the people that you need to win over are going to be people who have nuanced views on issues like illegal immigration and people who say, Yeah, we need secure borders; yes, we need more enforcement of our immigration laws; but maybe we don’t need to be putting out memes about, you know, a father being taken off in handcuffs.

That’s where I think the administration’s focus on speed and virality comes at a political cost. Someone’s’s going to have to pay for the tone that they’re taking online, and it’s likely going to be the Republicans who are up in 2026, unless, I don’t know, Democrats somehow overplay their hand on immigration issues.

And a lot of the voters who will determine the midterm elections are older voters. They’re not going to consume the memes firsthand, nor are they going to understand the memes. That’s something being lost in this debate too: even though more people than ever are getting their news through social media, a lot of the people who decide elections, and a lot of the people that Republicans need to win, are not meme consumers. It’s questionable whether it will pay off electorally for them.

Speaking of memes distilling political arguments:

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia. Read our story about why they’re provoking so much fury.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/chatgpt-health-has-arrived">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.
