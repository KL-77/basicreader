            <h2>Hallucinogen DMT an effective antidepressant in small clinical trial</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/hallucinogen-dmt-an-effective-antidepressant-in-small-clinical-trial/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the last few years, evidence has piled up that psychedelic drugs can provide relatively rapid relief from the symptoms of clinical depression. The drugs seemingly work by boosting the brain’s ability to remodel connections among neurons and incorporate new experiences. While we have a good picture of which proteins are responsible for the drug’s hallucinogenic effects, we’re still figuring out how those pathways plug into the brain’s ability to change itself.

Those lingering uncertainties aren’t standing in the way of people trying to develop potentially life-altering treatments. One of the big challenges is probably the hallucinations themselves, which can potentially incapacitate someone for hours after a treatment. But researchers have now described a study showing that the shortest-acting psychedelic, DMT, appears to be just as effective as the rest.

DMT, or dimethyltryptamine, is probably best known as a key component of ayahuasca, a liquid made from a combination of two or more plants. The mixture is important because the body produces an enzyme that rapidly digests DMT, blocking its effects. The additional plants contain a chemical that inhibits this enzyme, providing a longer-lasting experience.

In the absence of this inhibitor, however, the body clears DMT pretty quickly (it has a half-life of only about five minutes). Which means it’s potentially a great treatment, given that patients could be released from care shortly after receiving the drug. But it’s also possible that this brief stimulation wouldn’t be as effective at generating the sort of long-term changes in the brain triggered by other psychedelics. While there’s some evidence for an antidepressant effect, it has been limited so far.

A large collaboration set up a small clinical trial based at some London hospitals to gather more evidence of the effects. The study involved a blinded trial of a single DMT dose with a placebo control group (there were 47 people each in the experimental and control arms), coupled with counseling for depression. Two weeks later, everybody involved in the study got an open-label dose. Whether you can actually have a blinded trial of a psychedelic depends strongly on the degree to which you can have placebo-driven hallucinations, which seems pretty debatable. Depression symptoms were tracked weekly for 14 weeks after the initial dose.

One week after the initial dose, only 6 percent of the control group (meaning two individuals) reported improvements in their depression symptoms. In contrast, nearly half (44 percent) of those who received DMT reported feeling better. While the effect began to fade by the 14-week time point, this population was still far better off than when things started.

The control group participants, who only got one dose and got it two weeks into the study, showed an interesting trajectory. Their symptoms improved slightly over the first two weeks through some combination of a placebo effect and the counseling that everyone received. But then they got substantially better after the DMT dose, ending up somewhat better by the end of the study.

There were no serious side effects following treatment, and the less-than-serious ones tended to be short-lived, like a bit of pain at the injection site. There was also a very brief spike in heart rate and blood pressure.

One of the big questions about psychedelics has been whether their hallucinogenic effects and their antidepressant effects are separable. There are definitely indications that the two act through different mechanisms. But this study suggests that may not be the case with DMT. “Antidepressant effects two weeks after participants’ first active DMT dose were observed to be moderated by their ‘Mystical Experience’ Questionnaire (MEQ) scores, as well as Ego Dissolution Inventory,” the authors note.

None of this is to say that DMT will be the right solution for everyone—we’ll have to wait for a larger trial and longer follow-up to get a sense of its effectiveness. And it’s important to note that this study administered it as part of a general care plan. Still, it’s promising as a drug, since even its apparently brief period of mind alteration seems to have a significant impact on clinical depression, while also greatly simplifying care for those receiving the drug.

Given that many people don’t respond to traditional antidepressants, anything that provides an additional option would be welcome.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a while now, Mac owners have been able to use tools like CrossOver and Game Porting Toolkit to get many Windows games running on their operating system of choice. Now, GameSir plans to add its own potential solution to the mix, announcing that a version of its existing Windows emulation tool for Android will be coming to macOS.

Hong Kong-based GameSir has primarily made a name for itself as a manufacturer of gaming peripherals—the company’s social media profile includes a self-description as “the Anti-Stick Drift Experts.” Early last year, though, GameSir rolled out the Android GameHub app, which includes a GameFusion emulator that the company claims “provides complete support for Windows games to run on Android through high-precision compatibility design.”

In practice, GameHub and GameFusion for Android haven’t quite lived up to that promise. Testers on Reddit and sites like EmuReady report hit-or-miss compatibility for popular Steam titles on various Android-based handhelds. At least one Reddit user suggests that “any Unity, Godot, or Game Maker game tends to just work” through the app, while another reports “terrible compatibility” across a wide range of games.

With Sunday’s announcement, GameSir promises a similar opportunity to “unlock your entire Steam library” and “run Win games/Steam natively” on Mac will be “coming soon.” GameSir is also promising “proprietary AI frame interpolation” for the Mac, following the recent rollout of a “native rendering mode” that improved frame rates on the Android version.

In a recent interview with The Memory Core newsletter, GameSir admitted that its primary motivation for releasing a Windows emulation tool was to sell more of its controllers. But GameSir’s controllers aren’t required to use the Android version, which it says was sideloaded on 5 million (primarily Chinese) Android devices even before its official Google Play release in November.

GameHub on Android has also faced controversy for including a number of invasive trackers (which are removed in a community-built Lite version). A GameSir representative told The Memory Core that this was just standard practice in the Chinese market, where there is less sensitivity to such user tracking, and that it has since been removed.

The representative also addressed concerns about reusing open source compatibility code in that interview, saying that its Windows emulator was “developed in-house by GameSir’s core engineering team” with its “own in-house compatibility layer (such as syscall hooks, GameScopeVK, and other technologies), rather than modifications to Wine’s core code.” That said, the representative admitted GameFusion “reference[s] and use UI components from Winlator [an open source Windows emulation tool for Android]… to maintain ecosystem compatibility and familiarity.”

The compatibility issues and controversial corporate entity involved here probably mean that GameHub for Mac won’t be the Valve SteamOS/Proton moment that Apple gamers have been waiting for. Still, it’ll be nice for MacBook owners to have yet another option to play Windows games without needing to run a Windows install.</div>

            <h2>Password managers' promise that they can't see your vaults isn't always true</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past 15 years, password managers have grown from a niche security tool used by the technology savvy into an indispensable security tool for the masses, with an estimated 94 million US adults—or roughly 36 percent of them—having adopted them. They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data.

All eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given previous breaches of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets.

Typical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, for example, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, says that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass says that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”

New research shows that these claims aren’t true in all cases, particularly when account recovery is in place or password managers are set to share vaults or organize users into groups. The researchers reverse-engineered or closely analyzed Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass and identified ways that someone with control over the server—either administrative or the result of a compromise—can, in fact, steal data and, in some cases, entire vaults. The researchers also devised other attacks that can weaken the encryption to the point that ciphertext can be converted to plaintext.

“The vulnerabilities that we describe are numerous but mostly not deep in a technical sense,” the researchers from ETH Zurich and USI Lugano wrote. “Yet they were apparently not found before, despite more than a decade of academic research on password managers and the existence of multiple audits of the three products we studied. This motivates further work, both in theory and in practice.”

The researchers said in interviews that multiple other password managers they didn’t analyze as closely likely suffer from the same flaws. The only one they were at liberty to name was 1Password. Almost all the password managers, they added, are vulnerable to the attacks only when certain features are enabled.

The most severe of the attacks—targeting Bitwarden and LastPass—allow an insider or attacker to read or write to the contents of entire vaults. In some cases, they exploit weaknesses in the key escrow mechanisms that allow users to regain access to their accounts when they lose their master password. Others exploit weaknesses in support for legacy versions of the password manager. A vault-theft attack against Dashlane allowed reading but not modification of vault items when they were shared with other users.

One of the attacks targeting Bitwarden key escrow is performed during the enrollment of a new member of a family or organization. After a Bitwarden group admin invites the new member, the invitee’s client accesses a server and obtains a group symmetric key and the group’s public key. The client then encrypts the symmetric key with the group public key and sends it to the server. The resulting ciphertext is what’s used to recover the new user’s account. This data is never integrity-checked when it’s sent from the server to the client during an account enrollment session.

The adversary can exploit this weakness by replacing the group public key with one from a keypair created by the adversary. Since the adversary knows the corresponding private key, it can use it to decrypt the ciphertext and then perform an account recovery on behalf of the targeted user. The result is that the adversary can read and modify the entire contents of the member vault as soon as an invitee accepts an invitation from a family or organization.

Normally, this attack would work only when a group admin has enabled autorecovery mode, which, unlike a manual option, doesn’t require interaction from the member. But since the group policy the client downloads during the enrollment policy isn’t integrity-checked, adversaries can set recovery to auto, even if an admin had chosen a manual mode that requires user interaction.

Compounding the severity, the adversary in this attack also obtains a group symmetric key for all other groups the member belongs to since such keys are known to all group members. If any of the additional groups use account recovery, the adversary can obtain the members’ vaults for them, too. “This process can be repeated in a worm-like fashion, infecting all organizations that have key recovery enabled and have overlapping members,” the research paper explained.

A second attack targeting Bitwarden account recovery can be performed when a user rotates vault keys, an option Bitwarden recommends if a user believes their master password has been compromised. When account recovery is on (either manually or automatically), the user client regenerates the recovery ciphertext, which as described earlier involves obtaining a new public key that’s encrypted with the organization public key. The researchers denoted the group public key as pkorg. They denote the public key supplied by the adversary as pkadvorg, the recovery ciphertext as crec, and the user symmetric key as k′.

The key point here is that pkorg is not retrieved from the user’s vault; rather the client performs a sync operation with the server to obtain it. Crucially, the organization data provided by this sync operation is not authenticated in any way. This thus provides the adversary with another opportunity to obtain a victim’s user key, by supplying a new public key pkadvorg, for which they know the skadvorg and setting the account recovery enrollment to true. The client will then send an account recovery ciphertext crec containing the new user key, which the adversary can decrypt to obtain k′.

The third attack on the Bitwarden account recovery allows an adversary to recover a user’s master key. It abuses key connector, a feature primarily used by enterprise customers.

The attack allowing theft of LastPass vaults also targets key escrow, specifically in the Teams and Teams 5 versions, when a member’s master key is reset by a privileged user known as a superadmin. The next time the member logs in through the LastPass browser extension, their client will retrieve an RSA keypair assigned to each superadmin in the organization, encrypt their new key with each one, and send the resulting ciphertext to each superadmin.

Because LastPass also fails to authenticate the superadmin keys, an adversary can once again replace the superadmin public key (pkadm) with their own public key (pkadvadm).

“In theory, only users in teams where password reset is enabled and who are selected for reset should be affected by this vulnerability,” the researchers wrote. “In practice, however, LastPass clients query the server at each login and fetch a list of admin keys. They then send the account recovery ciphertexts independently of enrollment status.” The attack, however, requires the user to log in to LastPass with the browser extension, not the standalone client app.

Several attacks allow reading and modification of shared vaults, which allow a user to share selected items with one or more other users. When Dashlane users share an item, their client apps sample a fresh symmetric key, which either directly encrypts the shared item or, when sharing with a group, encrypts group keys, which in turn encrypt the shared item. In either case, the newly created RSA keypair(s)—belonging to either the shared user or group—isn’t authenticated. The item is then encrypted with the private key(s).

An adversary can supply their own key pair and use the public key to encrypt the ciphertext sent to the recipients. The adversary then decrypts that ciphertext with their corresponding secret key to recover the shared symmetric key. With that, the adversary can read and modify all shared items. When sharing is used in either Bitwarden or LastPass, similar attacks are possible and lead to the same consequence.

Another avenue for attackers or adversaries with control of a server is to target the backward compatibility that all three password managers provide to support older, less-secure versions. Despite incremental changes designed to harden the apps against the very attacks described in the paper, all three password managers continue to support the versions without these improvements. This backward compatibility is a deliberate decision intended to prevent users who haven’t upgraded from losing access to their vaults.

The severity of these attacks is lower than that of the previous ones described, with the exception of one, which is possible against Bitwarden. Older versions of the password manager used a single symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the user key from the server and items inside vaults. This design allowed for the possibility that an adversary could tamper with the contents. To add integrity checks, newer versions provide authenticated encryption by augmenting the symmetric key with an HMAC hash function.

To protect customers using older app versions, Bitwarden ciphertext has an attribute of either 0 or 1. A 0 designates authenticated encryption, while a 1 supports the older unauthenticated scheme. Older versions also use a key hierarchy that Bitwarden deprecated to harden the app. To support the old hierarchy, newer client versions generate a new RSA keypair for the user if the server doesn’t provide one. The newer version will proceed to encrypt the secret key portion with the master key if no user ciphertext is provided by the server.

This design opens Bitwarden to several attacks. The most severe, allowing reading (but not modification) of all items created after the attack is performed. At a simplified level, it works because the adversary can forge the ciphertext sent by the server and cause the client to use it to derive a user key known to the adversary.

The modification causes the use of CBC (cipher block chaining), a form of encryption that’s vulnerable to several attacks. An adversary can exploit this weaker form using a padding oracle attack and go on to retrieve the plaintext of the vault. Because HMAC protection remains intact, modification isn’t possible.

Surprisingly, Dashlane was vulnerable to a similar padding oracle attack. The researchers devised a complicated attack chain that would allow a malicious server to downgrade a Dashlane user’s vault to CBC and exfiltrate the contents. The researchers estimate that the attack would require about 125 days to decrypt the ciphertext.

Still other attacks against all three password managers allow adversaries to greatly reduce the selected number of hashing iterations—in the case of Bitwarden and LastPass, from a default of 600,000 to 2. Repeated hashing of master passwords makes them significantly harder to crack in the event of a server breach that allows theft of the hash. For all three password managers, the server sends the specified iteration count to the client, with no mechanism to ensure it meets the default number. The result is that the adversary receives a 300,000-fold decrease in the time and resources required to crack the hash and obtain the user’s master password.

Three of the attacks—one against Bitwarden and two against LastPass—target what the researchers call “item-level encryption” or “vault malleability.” Instead of encrypting a vault in a single, monolithic blob, password managers often encrypt individual items, and sometimes individual fields within an item. These items and fields are all encrypted with the same key. The attacks exploit this design to steal passwords from select vault items.

An adversary mounts an attack by replacing the ciphertext in the URL field, which stores the link where a login occurs, with the ciphertext for the password. To enhance usability, password managers provide an icon that helps visually recognize the site. To do this, the client decrypts the URL field and sends it to the server. The server then fetches the corresponding icon. Because there’s no mechanism to prevent the swapping of item fields, the client decrypts the password instead of the URL and sends it to the server.

“That wouldn’t happen if you had different keys for different fields or if you encrypted the entire collection in one pass,” Kenny Paterson, one of the paper co-authors, said. “A crypto audit should spot it, but only if you’re thinking about malicious servers. The server is deviating from expected behavior.

The following table summarizes the causes and consequences of the 25 attacks they devised:

The researchers acknowledge that the full compromise of a password manager server is a high bar. But they defend the threat model.

“Attacks on the provider server infrastructure can be prevented by carefully designed operational security measures, but it is well within the bounds of reason to assume that these services are targeted by sophisticated nation-state-level adversaries, for example via software supply-chain attacks or spearphishing,” they wrote. “Moreover, some of the service providers have a history of being breached—for example, LassPass suffered breaches in 2015 and 2022, and another serious security incident in 2021.

They went on to write: “While none of the breaches we are aware of involved reprogramming the server to make it undertake malicious actions, this goes just one step beyond attacks on password manager service providers that have been documented. Active attacks more broadly have been documented in the wild.”

Part of the challenge of designing password managers or any end-to-end encryption service is the tendency for a false sense of security of the client.

“It’s a psychological problem when you’re writing both client and server software,” Paterson explained. “You should write the client super defensively, but if you’re also writing the server, well of course your server isn’t going to send malformed packets or bad info. Why would you do that?”

In many of the cases, engineers have already fixed the weaknesses described after receiving private reports from the researchers. Engineers are still patching other vulnerabilities. In statements, Bitwarden, Lastpass, and Dashlane representatives noted the high bar of the threat model, despite statements on their websites that assure customers their wares will withstand it. Along with 1Password representatives, they also noted that their products regularly receive stringent security audits and undergo red-team exercises.

Bitwarden continually evaluates and improves its software through internal review, third-party assessments, and external research. The ETH Zurich paper analyzes a threat model in which the server itself behaves maliciously and intentionally attempts to manipulate key material and configuration values. That model assumes full server compromise and adversarial behavior beyond standard operating assumptions for cloud services.

LastPass said, “We take a multi‑layered, ongoing approach to security assurance that combines independent oversight, continuous monitoring, and collaboration with the research community. Our cloud security testing is inclusive of the scenarios referenced in the malicious-server threat model outlined in the research.”

A statement from Dashlane read, “Dashlane conducts rigorous internal and external testing to ensure the security of our product. When issues arise, we work quickly to mitigate any possible risk and ensure customers have clarity on the problem, our solution, and any required actions.”

1Password released a statement that read in part:

Our security team reviewed the paper in depth and found no new attack vectors beyond those already documented in our publicly available Security Design White Paper.

We are committed to continually strengthening our security architecture and evaluating it against advanced threat models, including malicious-server scenarios like those described in the research, and evolving it over time to maintain the protections our users rely on.

1Password also says that the zero-knowledge encryption it provides “means that no one but you—not even the company that’s storing the data—can access and decrypt your data. This protects your information even if the server where it’s held is ever breached.” In the company’s white paper linked above, 1Password seems to allow for this possibility when it says:

At present there’s no practical method for a user to verify the public key they’re encrypting data to belongs to their intended recipient. As a consequence it would be possible for a malicious or compromised 1Password server to provide dishonest public keys to the user, and run a successful attack. Under such an attack, it would be possible for the 1Password server to acquire vault encryption keys with little ability for users to detect or prevent it.

1Password’s statement also includes assurances that the service routinely undergoes rigorous security testing.

All four companies defended their use of the term “zero knowledge.” As used in this context, the term can be confused with zero-knowledge proofs, a completely unrelated cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a piece of information without revealing anything about the information itself. An example is a proof that shows a system can determine if someone is over 18 without having any knowledge of the precise birthdate.

The adulterated zero-knowledge term used by password managers appears to have come into being in 2007, when a company called SpiderOak used it to describe its cloud infrastructure for securely sharing sensitive data. Interestingly, SpiderOak formally retired the term a decade later after receiving user pushback.

“Sadly, it is just marketing hype, much like ‘military-grade encryption,’” Matteo Scarlata, lead author of the paper, said. “Zero-knowledge seems to mean different things to different people (e.g., LastPass told us that they won’t adopt a malicious server threat model internally). Much unlike ‘end-to-end encryption,’ ‘zero-knowledge encryption’ is an elusive goal, so it’s impossible to tell if a company is doing it right.”</div>

            <h2>Stephen Colbert says CBS forbid interview of Democrat because of FCC threat</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/stephen-colbert-says-cbs-forbid-interview-of-democrat-because-of-fcc-threat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Talk show host Stephen Colbert said CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of a Federal Communications Commission threat to enforce the equal-time rule on late-night and daytime talk shows.

Talarico “was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert said on last night’s episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on, and because my network clearly doesn’t want us to talk about this, let’s talk about this.”

Colbert went on to describe some of the background Ars readers are already familiar with. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr recently issued a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule, and subsequently opened an investigation into ABC’s The View after an interview with Talarico.

Formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, the rule generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate provide comparable time and placement to opposing candidates if any opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The equal-time rule is “the FCC’s most time-honored rule, right after ‘no nipples at the Super Bowl,’” Colbert said. Carr’s recent letter “said he was thinking about dropping the exception for talk shows because he said some of them were motivated by partisan purposes,” Colbert said, while accusing Carr of being motivated by partisan purposes himself.

“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV. He’s like a toddler with too much screen time,” Colbert said. Colbert also said he’s not allowed to show a photo of Talarico, but simultaneously showed a photo of the candidate.

We contacted CBS and its owner Paramount today and have not received a response. CBS denied prohibiting an interview with Talarico in a statement reported by Variety. The CBS statement acknowledged giving “legal guidance” about potential consequences under the equal-time rule, though.

“The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico,” the statement said. “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.”

Colbert played audio of a recent Carr interview in which the FCC chairman said, “If [Jimmy] Kimmel and Colbert want to continue to do their programming, they don’t want to have to comply with this requirement, then they can go to a cable channel or a podcast or a streaming service and that’s fine.”

Colbert said he “decided to take Brendan Carr’s advice” and interviewed Talarico for a segment posted on his show’s YouTube channel. “The network says I can’t give you a URL or a QR code but I promise you if you go to our YouTube page, you’ll find it,” Colbert said. That interview is available here.

Colbert described the unequal treatment of late-night talk shows and talk radio. “Carr here claims he’s just getting partisanship off the airwaves but the FCC is also in charge of regulating radio broadcasts. And what would you know, Brendan Carr says right-wing talk radio isn’t a target of the FCC’s equal time notice,” Colbert said.

Colbert said that a mere threat, and not an actual rule change, caused CBS to forbid him from interviewing a candidate. “At this point, he’s just released a letter that says he’s thinking about doing away with the exception for late night, he hasn’t done away with it yet,” Colbert said. “But my network is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had. But I want to assure you this decision is for purely financial reasons.”

Colbert’s tenure as host is scheduled to end in May. CBS announced it would end the show last year after Colbert called CBS owner Paramount’s $16 million settlement with Trump “a big fat bribe.” Paramount subsequently won FCC approval of an $8 billion merger with Skydance, while agreeing to Carr’s demand to install a “bias monitor.”

FCC Democrat Anna Gomez said today that CBS forbidding the interview with Talarico “is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration’s broader campaign to censor and control speech. The FCC has no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes or to create a climate that chills free expression. CBS is fully protected under the First Amendment to determine what interviews it airs, which makes its decision to yield to political pressure all the more disappointing.”

Gomez said Paramount “has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.” She urged broadcasters “to stand firm against these unlawful pressures and continue exercising their constitutional right to speak freely and without government interference.”

Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said today that “if what Colbert says is true, CBS needs new lawyers. Even the strictest reading of the equal time rule doesn’t prevent someone from saying the name of a candidate or talking about a URL. Even if the rule applied, CBS would not be required to offer an equal opportunity to Republican candidates at this time. Because Rep. Talarico is still a candidate in the primary, only his two primary opponents—Rep. Jasmine Crocket (D-Texas) and Ahmad Hassan—are entitled to equal opportunity. Nor did CBS have any responsibility to offer equal time to them; candidates must make a request on their own.”

Feld called the incident “disgraceful behavior by both CBS and the chairman of the FCC.” With the FCC targeting late-night TV but not talk radio, Feld said it appears that “broadcast appearances by Trump-friendly candidates will continue to receive exemptions from this rule while appearances by Trump-disapproved candidates will not.” Paramount’s capitulation seems to be more about “finding an excuse to curry favor with President Trump, rather than any concern over the equal time rule,” he said.

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) said that “candidate interviews have long been exempt from ‘equal time’ rules for good reason. It would be wrong if a Democratic administration demanded conservative talk radio hosts give equal airtime when they interview candidates, and it’s wrong for the Trump administration to demand the same of late night talk show hosts.”

FIRE Chief Counsel Robert Corn-Revere said that by “putting pressure on late night talk shows critical of the Trump administration while openly admitting that conservative talk radio is immune from the FCC’s ire,” Carr is “making himself the poster boy for big government putting its thumb on the scale of political debate.”

            <h2>Most VMware users still "actively reducing their VMware footprint," survey finds</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/most-vmware-users-still-actively-reducing-their-vmware-footprint-survey-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than two years after Broadcom took over VMware, the virtualization company’s customers are still grappling with higher prices, uncertainty, and the challenges of reducing vendor lock-in.

Today, CloudBolt Software released a report, “The Mass Exodus That Never Was: The Squeeze Is Just Beginning,” that provides insight into those struggles. CloudBolt is a hybrid cloud management platform provider that aims to identify VMware customers’ pain points so it can sell them relevant solutions. In the report, CloudBolt said it surveyed 302 IT decision-makers (director-level or higher) at North American companies with at least 1,000 employees in January. The survey is far from comprehensive, but it offers a look at the obstacles these users face.

Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition in November 2023, and last month, 88 percent of survey respondents still described the change as “disruptive.” Per the survey, the most cited drivers of disruption were price increases (named by 89 percent of respondents), followed by uncertainty about Broadcom’s plans (85 percent), support quality concerns (78 percent), Broadcom shifting VMware from perpetual licenses to subscriptions (72 percent), changes to VMware’s partner program (68 percent), and the forced bundling of products (65 percent).

When Broadcom bought VMware, some customers shared horror stories about receiving quotes that showed prices increasing by as much as 1,000 percent. CloudBolt’s survey paints a more modest picture. Fourteen percent of respondents said their VMware costs have at least doubled, while 12 percent reported increases of 50–99 percent, 33 percent reported increases of 24–49 percent, and 31 percent reported increases of less than 25 percent.

Despite survey participants suggesting smaller price hikes than originally anticipated under Broadcom, companies are still struggling with the pricing changes. Eighty-five percent are concerned that VMware will become even more expensive, according to CloudBolt’s survey.

Broadcom introduced changes to VMware that are especially unfriendly to small- and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and Gartner previously predicted that 35 percent of VMware workloads would migrate else by 2028.

CloudBolt’s survey also examined how respondents are migrating workloads off of VMware. Currently, 36 percent of participants said they migrated 1–24 percent of their environment off of VMware. Another 32 percent said that they have migrated 25–49 percent; 10 percent said that they’ve migrated 50–74 percent of workloads; and 2 percent have migrated 75 percent or more of workloads. Five percent of respondents said that they have not migrated from VMware at all.

Among migrated workloads, 72 percent moved to public cloud infrastructure as a service, followed by Microsoft’s Hyper-V/Azure stack (43 percent of respondents).

Overall, 86 percent of respondents “are actively reducing their VMware footprint,” CloudBolt’s report said.

“The fear has cooled, but the pressure hasn’t—and most teams are now making practical moves to build leverage and optionality—even if for some that includes the realization that a portion of their estate never moves off VMware,” Mark Zembal, CloudBolt’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement.

While bundled products, fewer options, resellers, and higher prices make VMware harder to justify for many, especially SMB customers, migration is a long process with its own costs, including time spent researching alternatives and building relevant skills. CloudBolt’s reported multi-platform complexity (52 percent) and skills gaps (33 percent) topped the list of migration challenges.

“As organizations diversify away from VMware, they inherit the operational burden of managing multiple platforms with different operational and governance models,” the report reads.

While companies determine the best ways to limit their dependence on VMware, Broadcom can still make money from smaller customers it doesn’t deem necessary for the long term.

“Their strategy was never to keep every customer,” CloudBolt’s report says. “It was to maximize value from those still on the platform while the market slowly diversifies. The model assumes churn and it’s built to make the economics work anyway. Broadcom has done the math—and they’re fine with it.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine turning the key or pressing the start button of your car—and nothing happens. Not because the battery is dead or the engine is broken but because a server no longer answers. For a growing number of cars, that scenario isn’t hypothetical.

As vehicles become platforms for software and subscriptions, their longevity is increasingly tied to the survival of the companies behind their code. When those companies fail, the consequences ripple far beyond a bad app update and into the basic question of whether a car still functions as a car.

Over the years, automotive software has expanded from performing rudimentary engine management and onboard diagnostics to powering today’s interconnected, software-defined vehicles. Smartphone apps can now handle tasks like unlocking doors, flashing headlights, and preconditioning cabins—and some models won’t unlock at all unless a phone running the manufacturer’s app is within range.

However, for all the promised convenience of modern vehicle software, there’s a growing nostalgia for an era when a phone call to a mechanic could resolve most problems. Mechanical failures were often diagnosable and fixable, and cars typically returned to the road quickly. Software-defined vehicles complicate that model: When something goes wrong, a car can be rendered inoperable in a driveway—or stranded at the side of the road—waiting not for parts but a software technician.

Take the example of Fisker. In May 2023, the California auto brand arrived in Britain with its Ocean Sport before filing for bankruptcy just one year later. Priced from £35,000 ($44,000)—although top-spec trims pushed the price to £60,000 ($75,000)—the all-electric Tesla Model Y rival featured tech including a partially retracting roof and a rotating BYD-like touchscreen. All cars also carried a six-year/62,000-mile (99,779 km) warranty, with the battery and powertrain covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,934 km).

Before Fisker’s 2024 bankruptcy, just 419 Fisker Oceans made it into British driveways. One unfortunate buyer, a marketing manager from Southampton, experienced the worst of the brand’s teething troubles. After taking delivery, her Ocean was plagued by persistent software glitches. Following a call to Fisker, engineers were dispatched to collect the vehicle for repairs, but when the car was due to be collected, it refused to start. Mere days later, Fisker declared insolvency, leaving the Ocean stranded as a 5,500 lb (2,500 kg) driveway ornament for the next ten months with no solution in sight.

Preceding Fisker, there was Better Place. Founded in 2007, Better Place wasn’t a car manufacturer but an EV infrastructure and software company that promised to solve range anxiety through battery-swap stations. Its entire model relied on centralized servers, subscriptions, and proprietary software to authenticate vehicles and manage battery exchanges. The flagship car for this system was the Renault Fluence Z.E., an electric sedan sold primarily in Israel and Denmark.

Better Place filed for bankruptcy in May 2013 after burning through $850 million, leading to Renault closing the Fluence Z.E’s Turkish assembly line. Servers were shut down, battery-swap stations stopped operating, and backend software used for authentication, charging, and fleet management disappeared, leaving many cars bricked.

These cases highlight a broader shift in the auto industry, where long-term ownership is increasingly dependent not just on mechanical durability but on continued access to proprietary software and manufacturer support.

“When a modern car’s software misbehaves, you don’t fix it yourself—you call the manufacturer,” said Stuart Masson, founder and editor of The Car Expert. “They control the code. At that point, you’re not dealing with a traditional service department so much as an IT help desk.”

That dependence, Masson warned, becomes a critical failure mode when the manufacturer disappears. “Sooner or later, every owner risks a Fisker-style scenario, where the company is gone and there’s nothing you can do about it.”

While informal owner communities have begun attempting to reverse-engineer and distribute unofficial software updates, Masson is blunt about the risks. “You’re trusting that someone on the Internet actually knows what they’re doing,” he said. “If they don’t, the consequences might not be that Android Auto simply stops working but instead an airbag deploying at 70 mph.”

While buying a second-hand Fisker in the UK is a high-risk move, more established manufacturers generally have contingency plans if a critical software partner goes under. In practice, that usually means issuing recalls or pushing over-the-air fixes to affected vehicles. Warranty coverage should handle most issues for newer cars, but the story gets murkier on the used market.

Take a decade-old Tesla Model S, for example: You might snag one at a bargain price, but there’s no guarantee Tesla will continue supporting it indefinitely. When a manufacturer drops software support, the car isn’t just at risk of breaking down—it becomes a potential cybersecurity liability. In a world where vehicles are increasingly defined by their code, running unsupported software is akin to leaving your router exposed to the Internet. You may have a functioning car today, but there’s no telling when—or how—it could stop running.

“Many teams, such as McLaren, who have F1 cars from the 1990s, require a 1990s-era laptop running an old Windows operating system, along with specialized interface hardware, for maintenance and to start the car,” Masson said. “We are up against time here, but it could be that brands like Tesla release its code, allowing people to use it. Who knows?”

The problem isn’t solely on the consumer; manufacturers shoulder a significant portion of the risk as well. One potential mitigation is standardization. Enter Catena-X, a collaborative data network connecting OEMs, suppliers, and IT vendors. By creating traceable digital records for parts and software—and standardizing data models and APIs for interoperability—Catena-X aims to make supply chains more resilient and software dependencies less catastrophic when a critical partner disappears.

When asked how OEMs can map software dependencies and mitigate vendor insolvency, Catena-X Managing Director Hanno Focken told Ars that “Catena-X supports software bills of materials and standardizes certain components to make software replaceable, plus a marketplace and open-source reference implementation helps OEMs find alternative vendors.”

The industry also shares responsibility in defining minimum operational lifespans for vehicle software. “As an association, Catena-X can facilitate shared industry commitments and consensus (e.g., data retention policies like a 10-year battery passport requirement), but it does not act as a regulator setting mandatory lifespans,” added Focken.

The lesson is clear: In today’s cars, the engine or electric motor isn’t always what keeps you moving—the software does. When that software vanishes with a bankrupt company, your car can go from daily driver to expensive paperweight overnight. And in the age of software-defined vehicles, owning a car increasingly means betting on the survival of its code. When that code dies, the driveway or highway—not the repair shop—becomes the final stop.</div>

            <h2>Tesla’s New Sales Data Is Absolutely Brutal</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past few months, Tesla has been making a major pivot away from its highly lucrative electric vehicles toward humanoid robots, a pet obsession of CEO Elon Musk’s. That restructuring campaign seems to be ahead of schedule, with Tesla’s electric vehicle sales plunging to astonishing lows.

The EV maker hit a four-year low in the US last month, selling 17 percent fewer cars in January compared to the same period last year, indicating the company’s core business is falling apart as Musk focuses his attention elsewhere.

An even more stark situation is playing out across the pond. According to an analysis by CleanTechnica using data from EU-EVs.com, which tracks battery electric vehicle registrations in European countries, Tesla’s overall sales in January of 2026 were down precipitously from the same point just two years ago. Across 13 European markets, Tesla vehicle sales were down 49.5 percent between January 2024 and January 2026, based on public vehicle registration data. Compared to the same point in January 2025, sales in 12 of these markets were down 23 percent.

Tesla’s European loss leaders include Norway, where sales dropped an astonishing 93 percent in two years, from 1,108 units in January 2024 to a measly 83 in January of this year. In the UK, registrations went from 1,591 units to just 714, a 55 percent fall. The Netherlands, meanwhile, saw sales drop 81 percent.

There were some small bright spots, like Ireland, where sales increased from 66 in January 2024 to 143 in January of this year. Finland, too, saw a 33 percent rise over the two years, from 169 vehicles to 224.

Unfortunately for Tesla’s shareholders, those aren’t nearly enough to stop the hemorrhaging. Though Musk’s political antics have undoubtedly done some heavy brand damage across Europe, he’s not the only reason for the slump. Tesla’s faltering sales also come amidst tense labor disputes in Germany and Sweden as a tidal wave of Chinese-made EVs floods the zone.

Whether the company is even interested in boosting its performance in Europe is unclear, but if these numbers are any indication, it would be a major uphill battle.

            <div id="article-text">Attention, gamers: if you thought new titles on top of the endless cavalcade of sequels and remakes were derivative now, wait till you hear about what the game engine maker Unity has got in store.

During a recent earnings call, the company’s CEO Matthew Bromberg teased a new version of its AI tool that he claims, while somehow maintaining a straight face, will eliminate the need for coding in game development. Now, any schmuck can prompt their way to being the next Hideo Kojima or Sam Lake. In theory, anyway.

“At the Game Developer Conference in March, we’ll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform — so it’s simple to move from prototype to finished product,” Bromberg said, as quoted by Game Developer.

“This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist,” he continued. “We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.”

The announcement represents a bold if not questionable double-down by Unity. A survey conducted by Game Developer found that over half of game workers think generative AI is bad for the industry. It’s also a massive reputational risk: pretty much any time a game gets caught using the tech becomes fuel for controversy. Underscoring its contentiousness, the video game storefront Steam requires developers disclose if their titles use any AI-generated content.

There’s also a growing pile of evidence suggesting that AI tools don’t improve productivity — or at least not without sacrificing quality or morale — with many programmers finding that AI coding tools are too error prone to be worth the hassle.

And that’s with people who have the experience to recognize where the tech falls short. Unity is probably aiming at developers who don’t know any better, or the clueless, dollar-sign-for-eyes bosses who will force it on their underlings. (This is a common trait among AI evangelists, newly converted or otherwise: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, for example, fumed that any employee who didn’t use AI to automate every possible task was “insane,” after some of his managers recommended dialing back AI usage. Another CEO bragged that he fired 80 percent of his staff because they weren’t as enthusiastic about AI as he was.)

Unity, however, is pushing AI for a supposedly beneficent purpose: to “democratize” game development.

“Our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience,” Bromberg said.

We’re not holding our breath for anything good to come of it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the last couple of months, the AI industry’s obsession with building out costly data centers has sent the price of RAM skyrocketing, turning a simple computer upgrade into a costly investment.

And while there are some early glimmers of hope, with RAM prices now falling across the pond, the next AI price hike could affect a different component instead: hard drives.

During a recent company earnings call, Irving Tan, the CEO of hard drive manufacturer Western Digital, admitted that “we’re pretty much sold out for calendar 2026.”

As PCWorld explains, Tan was referring to the company’s production capacity as part of an effort to allocate its available inventory to its customers.

While Western Digital hard drives will remain on the shelves for now, prices could soon follow the footsteps of RAM and graphical processing units as the hype surrounding generative AI continues to dominate markets — and terrify investors.

“As AI capabilities expand, cloud continues to grow as well, and both are driving the search and demand for higher density storage solutions,” Tan told investors. “In this new era where AI and cloud dominate, Western Digital has taken a customer-focused approach to managing this strong demand by working closely with our hyperscale customers, ensuring that we deliver reliable, high-capacity drives at scale to give them the best performance and total cost of ownership.”

The sales figures tell a clear story: just under 90 percent of the company’s revenue comes from cloud storage. The hyperscalers Tan was referring to are the cloud computing and data management services that need access to enormous data centers for both data processing and storage.

The enormous demand from AI industry players has already hit the hard drive market hard. In November, Tom’s Hardware reported that hard drives were on backorder for two years following major investments in AI data centers.

Tan’s comments will likely do little to reassure consumers. Between September and January, average hard drive prices had already surged by a whopping 46 percent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two researchers are warning of the devastating psychological impacts that AI automation, or the threat of it, can have on the workforce. The phenomenon, they argue in a new article published in the journal Cureus, warrants a new term: AI replacement dysfunction (AIRD).

The constant fear of losing your job could be driving symptoms ranging from anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, and loss of identity, according to the authors, which can manifest even in absence of other psychiatric disorders or other factors like substance abuse.

“AI displacement is an invisible disaster,” co-lead author Joseph Thornton, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Florida, said in a statement about the work. “As with other disasters that affect mental health, effective responses must extend beyond the clinician’s office to include community support and collaborative partnerships that foster recovery.”

Most of the attention on AI’s mental health impacts has centered on the effects of personally using the tech, with widespread reports of AI pulling users into psychotic episodes or encouraging dangerous behavior. But the stress that arises from the widespread fears surrounding the tech might deserve a closer look in a clinical context, too.

Job destruction is probably one of the biggest fears. A Reuters survey found that 71 percent of Americans are worried that AI could permanently put vast swaths of people out of work. The narrative is pushed by top figures in the industry. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, for example, infamously warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs. Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman added last week that AI could automate “most, if not all” white collar tasks within a year and a half.

There’re plenty of reasons to question these claims, but some number of AI-related layoffs are already happening. Amazon is in the middle of sacking 14,000 employees after boasting of the “efficiency gains” from using AI across the company. And one report found that AI was cited in the announcements of more than 54,000 layoffs last year.

Enter AIRD. In the paper, the authors cite one study that showed a positive correlation between AI implementation in the workplace and anxiety and depression. Another cited study found that stress and other negative emotions are common for professionals in fields that are considered susceptible to AI automation.

Co-lead author Stephanie McNamara, a psychology student at the University of Florida, said she coined the dysfunction after noticing a rise in AI-induced layoffs last year. “It made me think about the mental health impacts it is going to have on society,” she said in the statement.

According to the authors, AIRD will present uniquely for each sufferer, but will generally revolve around a cluster of symptoms including professional identity loss and loss of purpose. Some patients may even be in denial of AI’s relevance as a “defense mechanism,” they wrote. These may initially be foreshadowed with complaints related to insomnia and stress. The distress will not be “rooted in traditional psychopathology,” the authors add, “but in the existential threat of professional obsolescence.”

AIRD is not a clinically recognized diagnosis yet, the authors stress. But they propose a method for screening for the disorder through a careful progression of open-ended questions that should eliminate other causes like substance abuse. It’s important to recognize these as uniquely stemming from AI-related anxieties, they argue, because with the tech’s rise, more clinicians will encounter patients whose symptoms don’t arise from primary psychiatric disorders.

“Equipping mental health professionals with the knowledge and tools to recognize and treat people with AIRD will be vital for societal acceptance of a condition that will increasingly affect the workplace,” the researchers wrote.

            <h2>Pentagon Issues Threat to Anthropic</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US military had used Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot for its invasion of Venezuela and kidnapping of the country’s president Nicolás Maduro.

The exact details of Claude’s use remain hazy, but the incident demonstrated the Pentagon’s prioritization of the use of AI, and how tools available to the public may already be involved in military operations. And when Anthropic learned about it, its response was icy.

An Anthropic spokesperson remained tight-lipped on whether “Claude, or any other AI model, was used for any specific operation, classified or otherwise” in a statement to the WSJ, but noted that “any use of Claude — whether in the private sector or across government — is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed.”

The deployment reportedly occurred through the AI company’s partnership with the shadowy military contractor Palantir. Anthropic also signed an up to $200 million contract with the Pentagon last summer as part of the military’s broader adoption of the tech, alongside OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok.

Whether the Pentagon’s use of Claude broke any of Anthropic’s rules remains unclear. Claude’s usage guidelines forbid it from being used to “facilitate or promote any act of violence,” “develop or design weapons,” or “surveillance.”

Either way, Trump administration officials are now considering cutting ties with Anthropic over the company’s insistence that mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry remain off limits, Axios reports.

“Everything’s on the table,” including a dialing back of the partnership, a senior administration official told Axios. “But there’ll have to be an orderly replacement [for] them, if we think that’s the right answer.”

As if that phrasing wasn’t strong enough, a senior official — it’s unclear if it’s the same one — followed up with an even more pugnacious remark.

“It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this,” they told the site.

Anthropic reportedly reached out to Palantir to figure out whether Claude was used during the attacks on Venezuela, according to Axios’ sourcing, in signs of a broader culture clash and growing concerns of the tech being implicated in military operations.

Late last month, Anthropic already clashed over the limits of its $200 million contract with the Pentagon, including how many law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, could deploy it, per prior reporting by the WSJ.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has repeatedly warned of the inherent risks of the tech his company is working on, calling for more government oversight, regulation, and guardrails. He has also raised concerns over AI being used by autonomous lethal operations and domestic surveillance.

In a lengthy essay posted earlier this year, Amodei argued that large-scale AI-facilitated surveillance should be considered a crime against humanity.

Meanwhile, defense secretary Pete Hegseth doesn’t appear to share these hangups. Earlier this year, he promised that the Pentagon wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars,” a comment that sources told the WSJ concerned discussions with Anthropic.

Anthropic continues to insist that it’s “committed to using frontier AI in support of US national security” in a statement to both the WSJ and Axios.

However, its issues with the Pentagon appear to be going over well with its non-government users, who have been horrified by the tech being implicated in military action.

“Good job Anthropic, you just became the top closed [AI] company in my books,” one top post reads on the Claude subreddit.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While humanoid robots have a long way to go to prove useful in our day-to-day lives, they’ve at least made leaps and bounds in showing off their agility on stage.

Case in point, the televised Spring Festival Gala put on by the state-run China Media Group over the weekend featured an impressive synchronized martial arts routine. Organizers were even confident enough to put the well-being of children on the line, having young performers spar with a small army of nunchuck- and spear-wielding Unitree G1 robots.

At one point, several of the robots can be seen performing a wall flip, an impressive feat that involves them literally running up a temporary wall on stage. (You can check it out for yourself at the 3:16 mark in the video embedded below.)

It’s a dazzling performance, showcasing how far the country’s robotics industry has come in a few short years, a massive surge in interest that has even led to the country’s regulators warning of an impending bubble as an influx of robotics companies risks crowding one another out.

Users on social media immediately noticed an enormous technological leap, comparing this year’s performance to a far less impressive appearance a mere year ago, which saw less sophisticated humanoid robots awkwardly shuffling on stage while waving red handkerchiefs.

“Humanoids ⁠bundle a ⁠lot of China’s strengths into one narrative: AI capability, ​hardware supply chain, and manufacturing ambition,” Beijing-based tech analyst Poe Zhao told Reuters of the performance. “They are also the most ‘legible’ form factor for the public and officials.”

Whether the rest of the world, including Elon Musk’s Tesla, which is developing its own Optimus robot, can keep up with China remains to be seen. For one, Optimus robots still heavily rely on human remote operators.

“By far, the biggest competition for humanoid robots will be from China,” Musk told investors during an earnings call earlier this year. “China is good at manufacturing, and also in AI, judging from open models.”

“To the best of my knowledge, we don’t see significant competition outside of China,” he added. “People outside of China underestimate China, but China’s an ass-kicker next-level.”

However, whether all of that martial arts expertise can be translated into actually-useful skills — arming robots with nunchucks isn’t exactly going to give China an edge on the battlefield, the workforce, or domestic labor — is still a wide-open question. Robotics companies are struggling to get their humanoid robots to adjust to the messy reality of daily life on the fly, and are only starting to make some progress.

In other words, while having robots sparring with children live on stage as part of a well-rehearsed choreography is unquestionably impressive, reliably doing chores around the house could prove far more difficult in the long run — even for China.

“Cool,” one Reddit user commented on the latest martial arts performance. “Can I please get one that just cleans my house and does the laundry?”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/kana-emerges-from-stealth-with-15m-to-build-flexible-ai-agents-for-marketers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marketing is one of the few operations no industry can afford to ignore, which is why we have a veritable host of AI-powered marketing tools being shoved into marketers’ faces today. All the social platforms, from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok, and major incumbents like Microsoft and Google, to content-generation startups like Jasper and Copy.ai, offer AI tools that claim to make marketers’ lives easier in uncountable ways.

That was partly why I was confused to see yet another marketing AI startup entering the fray: San Francisco-based Kana just came out of stealth with a suite of AI agents that can do data analysis, audience targeting, campaign management, customer engagement, media planning, and optimizing for AI chatbots. The startup has raised $15 million in a seed funding round led by Mayfield.

But Kana has something going for it that most marketing startups today don’t: its co-founders, Tom Chavez (CEO; pictured above on the right) and Vivek Vaidya (CTO; pictured above), have been building marketing tech for more than 25 years. Kana’s actually their fourth venture after Rapt (acquired by Microsoft in 2008), Krux (bought by Salesforce in 2016), and startup studio super{set}, which they incubated Kana in for 9 months.

Calling this a “wondrous” time to be building, Chavez said there was a clear opportunity to bring their experience and today’s AI tech to bear on this class of problems. “We see a market that’s crying out for solutions that meet this moment […] We understand the space deeply, having wallowed in it arguably a little too long; having really stood in our customers’ pain,” he told TechCrunch.

The solution, as Kana pitches it, involves “loosely coupled” AI agents that can be tailored “on the fly,” integrated into legacy marketing software, and can simultaneously work on different operations. So a marketer could, for example, upload a media brief that Kana’s agents would analyze to figure out the campaign goals, search for the audience to target, and pull in data from inventory and market research to further tweak the plan. The platform bakes in autonomous campaign tracking, optimization, and reporting.

Alongside agents, Kana offers synthetic data generation to augment third-party data sources for activities like market research and audience targeting. This, Chavez argued, could help companies reduce the costs of using third-party data, fill in gaps in the data, and help marketers run tests on various platforms faster and narrow down strategies.

Kana says this is all done while keeping humans in the loop so that marketers can approve the AI agents’ actions, give feedback, and customize what the agents do as their needs change.

Chavez and Vaidya emphasized the importance of the platform’s flexibility, arguing that the ability to deploy, tailor, and build new agents in real time would let marketers see results on their campaigns faster than they would with legacy systems.

Going forward, the startup sees that very flexibility to customize its platform for customers, doubling as its moat against incumbents and other startups building similar products.

“We have the opportunity not to create bespoke solutions, but to highly tailor and configure these solutions to meet customers where they are. Larger companies just are never going to get there,” Chavez said.

“We live in a world which allows us to explore a third option [with customers]: not build, not buy, but build with — build with in a way which is supported,” Vaidya added. “We can move with insane speed that these big companies just cannot. And that’s our advantage.”

Kana will use the fresh cash to expand hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market. Mayfield managing partner Navin Chaddha is joining the company’s board.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The internet today has a permissions problem. As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.

Now, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a pretty plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.

Venice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round.

Unlike many of its well-funded rivals – which include Persona (raised a $200 million Series D last April), Veza (closed a $108 million Series D in May 2025), and GitGuardian SAS (raised $50 million last week) – Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.

At its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.

She later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm.

That brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market – it’s a completely different approach.”

To replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises.

The technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.

“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains.

“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.

The bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical 6 months to 2 years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.

Cack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”

Wilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”

Though crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.

Venice’s team is split between Israel, where R&D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors.

Lurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.

For Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”

The question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has confirmed that a bug allowed its Copilot AI to summarize customers’ confidential emails for weeks without permission.

The bug, first reported by Bleeping Computer, allowed Copilot Chat to read and outline the contents of emails since January, even if customers had data loss prevention policies to prevent ingesting their sensitive information into Microsoft’s large language model.

Copilot Chat allows paying Microsoft 365 customers to use the AI-powered chat feature in its Office software products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Microsoft said the bug, trackable by admins as CW1226324, means that draft and sent email messages “with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat.”

The tech giant said it began rolling out a fix for the bug earlier in February. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, including a question about how many customers are affected by the bug.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament’s IT department told lawmakers that it blocked the built-in AI features on their work-issued devices, citing concerns that the AI tools could upload potentially confidential correspondence to the cloud.

            <h2>OpenAI pushes into higher education as India seeks to scale AI skills</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/openai-pushes-into-higher-education-as-india-seeks-to-scale-ai-skills/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is expanding its footprint in India and moving into the country’s higher-education system through partnerships with leading academic institutions. The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world’s largest talent markets.

On Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.

Rather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signalling OpenAI’s interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world’s largest higher-education systems.

OpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over 100 million monthly active users in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company’s second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week.

The first cohort of partners includes some of India’s most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialised design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.

India has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would expand its Elevate skilling program in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.

OpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.

Two of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including PhysicsWallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.

Raghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.

Last year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator programme focused on expanding AI skills.

The flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/canva-gets-to-4b-in-revenue-as-llm-referral-traffic-rises/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Creative company Canva ended 2025 on a high note with a 20% increase in monthly active users, growth that was partially propelled by adoption of its AI tools.

Canva had more than 265 million monthly active users and over 31 million paid users in 2025, according to the company. That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR.

The company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets. To increase paying users, Canva has introduced lower-priced subscriptions in countries like Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica.

Canva’s AI investments are paying off, according to Obrecht. The company debuted a tool that lets users create mini apps and websites using AI last year. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It’s been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.

That shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a full-packaged creator suite by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStagewith into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio.

“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we’re giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We’re inverting that now. We’re becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.

Canva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT. It also claimed that Canva was one of the top 10 referred domains from ChatGPT.

Obrecht said that the company is allocating resources to work on having Canva surface in LLM search results, along with working on SEO.

“So we drove a lot of early days in Canva through Google, really understood people’s search intent, and delivered them content that they could then go into our product and edit. And so we really see ChatGPT or any of the LLMs top of the funnel acquisition platforms,” he said.

He noted that while search is a big driving factor, traffic through LLM referrals is in double-digit percentages. The company is also allocating resources to have Canva surface more in chatbots.

Canva was last valued at $42 billion in a share sell. Obrecht told Bloomberg last November, that the company will go public in the next “couple of years.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/world-labs-lands-200m-from-autodesk-to-bring-world-models-into-3d-workflows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs has secured a $200 million investment from software design giant Autodesk. The partnership will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models  — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases.

The deal is part of a larger round for World Labs, according to Autodesk, which declined to disclose further details. World Labs, which emerged from stealth in 2024 with $230 million at a $1 billion valuation, is reportedly now in talks to raise capital at a $5 billion valuation.

World Labs did not immediately return a request for more details.

For World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, Marble, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments.

Autodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business.

Or as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”

As part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an advisor to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.”

Daron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet.

“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said.

He mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in.

“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’s] prompts,” Green said.

Green added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.

Green said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including Google DeepMind and Runway — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy.

Autodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation.

“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’s tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”

The partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing “neural CAD,” a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world.

Autodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world.

Green thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models and neural CAD, will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers.

“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”

            <h2>The Worst-Case Future for White-Collar Workers</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ai-white-collar-jobs/686031/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">White-collar workers are getting nervous, with good reason. Sure, 98 percent of college graduates who want a job still have one, and wages are ticking up. Sure, some companies that cite the labor-saving, efficiency-promoting effects of ChatGPT and Claude as they let employees go are just “AI washing”—talking about algorithms to distract from poor managerial decisions.

But the labor market for office workers is beginning to shift. Americans with a bachelor’s degree account for a quarter of the unemployed, a record. High-school graduates are finding jobs quicker than college graduates, an unprecedented trend. Occupations susceptible to AI automation have seen sharp spikes in joblessness. Businesses really are shrinking payroll and cutting costs as they deploy AI. In recent weeks, Baker McKenzie, a white-shoe law firm, axed 700 employees, Salesforce sacked hundreds of workers, and the auditing firm KPMG negotiated lower fees with its own auditor. Two CNBC reporters with no engineering experience “vibe-coded” a clone of Monday.com’s workflow-management platform in less than an hour. When they released their story, Monday.com’s stock tanked.

Maybe algorithm-driven changes will happen slowly, giving workers plenty of time to adjust. Maybe white-collar types have 12 to 18 months left. Maybe the AI-related job carnage will be contained to a sliver of the economy. Maybe we should be more worried about a stock-market bubble than an AI-driven labor revolution.

I don’t think anyone knows what will happen, or even what is happening now. AI technology is changing at an exponential pace, and changing the workforce in a thousand hard-to-parse ways. But if AI quickly eliminates white-collar work, the country is going to end up in something much stranger than a downturn, and something much harder to recover from too.

The United States is adept enough at handling the labor-market damage caused by recessions. Congress slashes taxes, writes stimulus checks, and fattens unemployment-insurance payouts. Washington amps up infrastructure spending and patches holes in the budgets of state and local governments. The Federal Reserve drops interest rates down to zero and purchases hundreds of billions of dollars of safe assets, making borrowing cheaper for families and encouraging businesses to invest. Demand increases, pushing the unemployment rate down and GDP up.

But if white-collar layoffs cause a downturn, Washington might not be able to restore hiring and lift consumer spending as it has done before. Businesses wouldn’t need the skills workers possess. Firms wouldn’t want to hire the legions of accountants, engineers, lawyers, middle managers, human-resources executives, financial analysts, PR types, and customer-service agents they just laid off. (Writers would be fine, I choose to believe.) The United States would have a “structural” unemployment problem, as economists put it, not a “cyclical” demand problem.

The country has struggled with structural joblessness in the past, but the problem has tended to afflict blue-collar workers, not white-collar ones. The labor market is normally womblike in the security it delivers the college-educated. The downsizing trend of the 1990s did not actually result in the pool of office jobs shrinking. Even during the Great Recession, the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor’s degree never went higher than 5.3 percent. For workers with only an associate’s degree or some college credits, it hit 9 percent; for workers with only a high-school diploma, 11.9 percent.

In this new economic paradigm, the educated and well-to-do would fare worse than their less-educated and lower-income neighbors. The main bulwark against joblessness—the unemployment-insurance system—wouldn’t meet the challenge. Payments last for only so long: six months at most currently, 18 months during the coronavirus pandemic. If AI eliminated the need for office work, many people would be unemployed for years; their earnings would potentially fall, their mental health would deteriorate, and their chance of finding a new position would diminish with every month that passed. Plus, the unemployment system isn’t designed to support six-figure earners. Most state payments max out at $500 or $600 a week, a quarter of what many upper-middle-class employees earn. Young workers would face their own challenges: The pool of entry-level white-collar jobs would shrink, as it already is, pushing recent graduates’ income down for years, even decades.

If rich households cut back on spending, many businesses that have nothing to do with AI—grocery stores, gas stations, retail shops, hairdressers, restaurants—would suffer and the labor market would keep deteriorating. The housing market would begin to falter; home prices in many regions would fall and fewer properties would go to market. Tax revenue might fall. Bond yields might go up as the country’s deficits increased, making it harder for the Fed to stimulate investment. Rank-and-file workers’ incomes would drop at the same time that executives using AI to cut costs would see their wealth increase. Inequality would rise to even higher heights. The 0.01 percent would pull away from the 0.1 percent, which would pull away from the 1 percent.

White-collar workers would go through what blue-collar workers went through beginning in the 1970s. Advances in machine technology improved productivity and depressed employment in Detroit; Pittsburgh; Gary, Indiana; and Worcester, Massachusetts. Rust Belt communities fell apart and never recovered. Then China joined the World Trade Organization, and globalization spurred another round of job losses, causing even more permanent damage. Affected workers ended up poorer, less happy, and less healthy. They died sooner. Their kids were worse off too.

To get the economy going again during the AI transition, the country would need to figure out how to get white-collar workers back to work. And I really mean figure out—essentially from scratch. Existing workforce-training initiatives have yielded “muted” and “inconclusive” results. Existing displaced-worker initiatives have “dubious” value. These kinds of programs offer net-negative value to participants, taxpayers, and “society as a whole,” studies have found. Community-college programs have the strongest track record, but the overwhelming majority of office workers have a two-year or four-year degree already. The country doesn’t have answers that don’t involve upskilling, education, or trying and failing to compensate the losers.

Silicon Valley leaders are enamored of one policy Hail Mary: the establishment of a universal basic income, in which the government would provide all adults with $1,500 a month or so, no strings attached and in perpetuity. It’s not as crazy an idea as it sounds; think of it as Social Security for everyone, or an extension of the earned-income tax credit to families without any earned income. The cash would ensure that every family kept its head above water, and redistribute the wealth generated by rising productivity. “People will be freed up to spend more time with people they care about, care for people, appreciate art and nature, or work toward social good,” Sam Altman of OpenAI has argued.

But UBI is a dystopian outcome, not a utopian one. For families to thrive in this new post-work paradigm, the government would need to redistribute a lot more than $1,500 per person per month, necessitating confiscatory taxes on corporations—taxes they would fight tooth and nail. The bigger problem would be that Americans would hate a world without work, where the jobless rate floats at 30 percent instead of 4 percent. Many Americans like working. They like having somewhere to go during the day. They like trading watercooler stories with their colleagues. They like getting promoted and starting their own firms. They are proud of earning a living. Long-term unemployment destroys people’s mental and physical health, and generates toxic societal unrest. Politicians love saying that Americans want a hand up, not a handout—and they aren’t wrong.

Perhaps Americans would adjust, and American culture would adjust in turn. Maybe people would become more interested in and fulfilled by leisure, art, and other activities. But it’s hard to imagine social capital being divorced from actual capital. It’s even harder to imagine the country becoming more egalitarian and its politics more participatory, instead of developing a hyper-wealthy techno-oligarchy and a dispossessed and teed-off underclass. Some people would spend their time gardening, volunteering, painting, exercising, or learning. Others would spend hours a day watching short-form videos and never leave their apartments.

I don’t really think society will come to this. Throughout history, people have used technology to become more productive and prosperous without reducing the demand for human labor overall. Then again, maybe I’m just in denial.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The urge to visit Beijing has gotten stronger lately among allies of the United States. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who referred to China last year as his country’s biggest security threat, made the trip last month, as did his British counterpart, Keir Starmer. Next week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who heads the largest economy in Europe, plans to meet with Xi Jinping during a three-day visit packed with discussions of security and trade.

In a speech this past weekend at the Munich Security Conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. “will always be a child of Europe.” But the geopolitical divide between the U.S. and China has made Canadians and Europeans look more like the children in a bad divorce, shuttling between two feuding parents, pleasing neither, and risking retaliation if they take sides. Carney said as much in a memorable speech last month in Davos, where he bemoaned the fact that the superpowers are now vying for dominance in ways that place their own self-interest over cooperation. And they are prepared to dole out punishment to those who offend them. “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,” Carney said.

That approach has forced Canada and other medium-size nations to pursue the same transactional self-interest, Carney noted. Hence his Beijing visit a few days before he gave the speech. “We are seeking to ensure our own economic resilience,” Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, who traveled with Carney to Beijing, told us last week. “That means we have to diversify our trading partners.” And what about Carney’s statement in April, during his election campaign, about the looming security threat from the Chinese? Has it disappeared?

The diplomat stiffened. “Let’s take a step back,” she said, before offering a disquisition on all that President Trump had done to Canada since returning to office a year ago, including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian-made steel, aluminum, cars, and lumber. “Canada is seeking to double non-U.S. trade over the next 10 years,” Anand said. “That was the purpose of the trip.”

Canada’s overtures to Beijing clearly got Trump’s attention. In a post on Truth Social last week, the president wrote that Carney “wants to make a deal with China—which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so.” Trump then threatened to prevent a newly built bridge between Ontario and Michigan from opening, at least until Canada starts treating the U.S. “with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.”

It can be hard to keep track of the insults and intimidation that U.S. allies have faced from the Trump administration over the past year. But the indignities have been enough to make many traditionally steadfast American partners talk in private about a permanent rupture in relations with Washington. Carney’s speech in Davos brought the hand-wringing into the open, and it offered a way for “middle powers” to move forward by banding together against global hegemons like the United States.

But in practice, Carney’s response to Trump’s bullying has been a newfound openness to China. He agreed on a plan, during his visit there last month, for the Chinese to lower trade barriers on a variety of Canadian goods, including beef, lobsters, and pet food. As of yesterday, Canadian citizens are now allowed to travel to China without a visa for up to 30 days. “We are forging a new strategic partnership,” Carney declared.

Yet given the power differential between China and Canada—or, for that matter, between China and any NATO ally other than the United States—such a partnership will not be among equals. And were Canada in the future to veer back toward the U.S., which remains by far its biggest trading partner, Carney could expect the kind of retaliation from Beijing that Trump now threatens. In other words, Canada and others might consider the smart move to be economically and diplomatically hedging their bets between Washington and Beijing. But they are just as likely to get stuck between a pair of repelling magnets, pushed and pulled by the world’s superpowers.

Plenty of European countries have been here before, swinging between the U.S. and China, and they have learned the perils. During the Biden administration, the U.S. pressured its allies to take a harder line against China, and many complied. Among the most eager was the tiny nation of Lithuania, which blocked Chinese companies from building its 5G communications network and other infrastructure.

“At least temporarily, it had a positive impact on our relations with the United States,” the president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, told us. In part to keep the good vibes going, his government antagonized China further in 2021 by allowing Taiwan to build a representative office in Vilnius, the capital. (China sees Taiwan as a rogue province and aims to take it back by force if necessary.)

The Lithuanian decision to welcome Taiwan earned applause from the American foreign-policy establishment; the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, referred to Lithuania as a “trailblazer” in the push to counter Chinese influence in Europe. Lithuania shares an approximately 180-mile-long border with Russia and would not be able to defend that frontier without help from its allies in the NATO alliance. “For us, being so vulnerable, and being in such a sensitive place on Earth, it’s very important to keep the focus of the United States on the one hand and of European allies on the other hand,” Nausėda said.

But the price of maintaining that focus “was quite dramatic,” he said. “China started economic coercion against us.” Lithuanian diplomats were forced to leave their embassy in China, which moved to temporarily block the import of Lithuanian goods. The government in Vilnius hoped the confrontation would pay off with a greater American commitment to its country’s security. “It was a strategic choice,” Gabrielius Landsbergis, who was the foreign minister of Lithuania during the Biden administration, told us. “And our cooperation with the previous administration was very successful.”

Soon after Trump returned to the White House, however, the security dividends that Lithuania had earned began to dissipate. Under the new administration, “small countries do not matter,” Landsbergis said, summarizing Trump’s approach to geopolitics. “That’s a problem for us. When great powers begin carving up the world, we find ourselves no longer at the table, but on the menu.”

In recent weeks, as the tensions between the U.S. and Europe have intensified, the Lithuanian government has come to regret its decision to stand up to Beijing. Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginienė said earlier this month that it had been a “big mistake” to allow the opening of the Taiwanese representative office. “I believe that Lithuania really jumped in front of a train and lost,” she told the Baltic News Service.

China seems ready to accept Lithuania’s atonement. A spokesperson for its foreign ministry said the door to Beijing remains open as long as Lithuania intends to “correct its wrongdoings at an early date.” But Lithuania’s president does not see a strategic turn toward China as an option at this point. Even as other European countries are rushing to foster relations with Beijing, the Lithuanians intend to stick with the Americans. “There’s no alternative,” Nausėda said in our interview. For the moment, at least, they are stuck with Trump.

Over the long term, if Europeans want to avoid falling under the sway of either of the world’s two dominant superpowers, they can try to form their own geopolitical center of gravity. But that would require speaking with one voice, and their scattershot outreach to China makes that difficult. In December, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited Beijing, his team reportedly wanted the European Union’s most senior official, Ursula von der Leyen, to accompany him.

“This was seen as an effort to ‘Europeanise’ his dealings with Beijing,” the South China Morning Post reported at the time. The Chinese authorities reportedly turned down the idea, preferring instead to deal with European leaders one by one, and Macron agreed to come without his EU counterpart. In preparation for next week’s trip, Germany’s Merz met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister. Wang applauded the German leader for planning the trip in a way that would maintain Berlin’s “strategic autonomy and self-reliance.”

That approach has raised concerns among Germany’s smaller allies in Europe, who worry that they could be left behind. Petr Pavel, the president of the Czech Republic, does not have the option of traveling to Beijing. “I am persona non grata in China,” Pavel told us in an interview last week. The Chinese banned him from the country last summer, after he paid a visit to India to wish a happy birthday to the Dalai Lama, who turned 90 in July. (China regards the spiritual leader of Tibet as a separatist “wolf in monk’s clothing.”)

The timing of Pavel’s meeting with the holy man looks unfortunate in hindsight. It took place only a few months before U.S. relations with Europe reached a crisis point, when Trump, in January, threatened to seize the island of Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. The resulting rupture sent the Europeans scrambling to line up trips to Beijing. But when we asked Pavel about his regrets, he said he has none. “We have to understand that China is not an ally,” he said. “It is at best our competitor.”

Pavel understands the desire among some of his peers to look to Beijing amid the rising tensions with Washington, but he would prefer they take a more confident and unified approach. “Europe should become its own zone of influence,” he said. “Not looking eastwards and then westwards and back again, always being afraid for our security, but instead to become stronger and on our own, economically stronger and also militarily.” That may be the better long-term strategy, but there remain serious doubts whether the Europeans can pull it off.

Carney is leading his own effort to form, in effect, a third superpower that can resist the gravitational pulls of both the United States and China. Talks are under way among Canada, the European Union, and 12 Indo-Pacific nations to form a new trade alliance that would potentially represent the world’s largest economic bloc. Asked about it yesterday, Carney told reporters that “Canada can play a role” in forming a new alliance, adding that his country is in a “unique position” to “broker a bridge” between the two groups of nations in Europe and Asia.

In the meantime, the U.S. is demanding more if Ottawa wants to remain in Trump’s good graces. In August, Trump increased tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent, saying Carney’s government hadn’t done enough of what Washington wants. Last month, Trump threatened to decertify any aircraft made in Canada until the Canadians certify American-made Gulfstreams. Canada is now reconsidering its decades-old agreement to buy F-35A fighter jets from Lockheed Martin and may instead buy Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 E Gripens.

The pressure on Canada seems to be part of a broader Trump-administration strategy to reinvigorate American industries and limit—maybe even eliminate—any products that don’t carry a Made in America label. When Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke to a Toronto audience last year, he suggested that Canada should not even be making cars. It would be better, he suggested, to consolidate the entire North American auto industry in the U.S. Needless to say, that has been viewed in Canada as just another way the U.S. is seeking to flex its muscles at Canadians’ expense.

“We are being bombarded with complaints, grievances, tariffs, more tariffs,” Giles Gherson, president and CEO of the Toronto Region Board of Trade, Canada’s largest chamber of commerce, told us. “As soon as the concessions are made and they’re pocketed, new demands show up—and relentlessly.”

Ultimately, Trump’s posturing toward Canada isn’t about Canada. It’s about seeking to sustain Washington’s superiority over China and making sure that American allies know their place. The president won’t let anything—not even a very public dispute with America’s friendly neighbor to the north—get in the way.</div>

            <h2>The Harvard of the South … Of the West?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/satellite-campus-expansion-vanderbilt/686032/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, is the sort of highly selective institution that jockeys for the unofficial title of Harvard of the South. Recently, the university’s chancellor had a new idea: What if Vanderbilt was also in San Francisco? Maybe it could become the Harvard of the West too.

Last month, Vanderbilt announced that it was acquiring the facilities of the financially insolvent California College of the Arts and would be converting the space into a new campus. Private universities have been experimenting with satellite campuses for decades. Typically, these outposts are either overseas or limited to a graduate program or two. The Vanderbilt expansion, set to open in 2027, will be different: It will include a full-blown, four-year undergraduate college, not in Abu Dhabi but in the San Francisco Design District. This new tactic, pioneered by Northeastern University a few years ago, is taking the satellite-campus concept to its logical extreme: the national-chain model of undergraduate education. If it works for Vanderbilt, other selective institutions are likely to follow—because no one really wants to be the Harvard of the South. Everyone wants to be Harvard. Perhaps the way for excellent regional schools to develop a national reputation is to set up shop around the nation.

For most of the history of higher education, a university has been ineluctably tied to a particular city: Bologna. Oxford. Cambridge. The other Cambridge. In the United States, the first wave of satellite campuses began to appear in the post–World War II period as the share of Americans attending college surged. To meet growing demand, public universities opened branches in far-flung areas of their state. (Most Texans, for example, live far from Austin.) That’s how systems such as the University of California evolved into sprawling behemoths.

Rose Horowitch: The college backlash is a mirage

The next phase of expansions was very different. In the 2000s, some private institutions began establishing international outposts to cash in on global demand for their prestige. Northwestern University started awarding bachelor’s degrees out of a campus in Qatar in 2008. Columbia opened a Middle East research center in Amman, Jordan, in 2009. The next year, New York University established an undergraduate campus in Abu Dhabi; NYU Shanghai followed not long after. Less selective institutions are trying this approach as well: The University of New Haven recently announced that it would create a campus for undergraduates and grad students in Riyadh. “You would find some authoritarian petro-state somewhere that had a ton of money and was very impressed by the brand allure of high-class American universities,” Kevin Carey, the vice president of education and work at the think tank New America, told me.

More recently, colleges have focused on domestic expansion, creating outposts in the nation’s capital. Nearly 20 institutions have satellite campuses in Washington, D.C. Some are small, occupying a floor of an office building; others, including the University of Southern California and Arizona State University, have their own buildings emblazoned with their school’s logo in massive font. In 2019, Johns Hopkins University, based in Baltimore, paid more than $370 million to acquire a new home for its School of Advanced International Studies in the building that had previously housed the Newseum. D.C. campuses tend to confer graduate degrees and serve as a home base for undergrads interning on Capitol Hill and K Street. They also give university leaders easy access to government officials.

The school that has come closest to a true brick-and-mortar national-chain model is Northeastern University, which is known for its emphasis on combining academics with career-focused internships. In the 2010s, as the university’s officials realized that they could attract only so many students to Boston, the school began setting up campuses to reach more markets. “A university cannot be defined by its campus,” Joseph Aoun, Northeastern’s president, told me. “We’re going to them rather than asking them to come to one campus.” Since 2011, Northeastern has opened eight graduate-focused branch campuses in major cities across the U.S. and Canada. These are designed to help students network and land a job in their preferred city after graduation. Northeastern has used this strategy to enroll more students—raising tuition revenue—without increasing the main campus’s acceptance rates. “Going back about 25 years ago, Northeastern was a top-150 university,” Peter Stokes, a higher-education consultant who previously worked at Northeastern and helped launch its expansion, told me. “Today it’s a top-50 university.”

Most graduate programs are small. Setting up a full undergraduate campus is a much more ambitious undertaking. In 2022, Northeastern acquired Mills College, in Oakland, absorbing the school’s real estate and some tenured faculty, and creating Northeastern University at Oakland. Two years later, it merged with Marymount Manhattan College to create a New York–based undergraduate campus. Aoun calls Northeastern a “global university system.” He said, “We don’t like to call them branch campuses, because our model is not to export into another city or another country what we have been doing in Boston.”

Now comes Vanderbilt, adopting a similar strategy. Daniel Diermeier, the school’s chancellor, is widely perceived within higher ed as trying to elbow into the Harvard-Yale-Stanford stratum. When I asked him if the expansion plan is an effort to rise in the rankings, he deflected, saying that “​​our aspiration is to be innovative.” But he did not deny a certain ambition. “A core component of being a great university in the 21st century is to be part of an innovation economy,” he said. He pointed to Stanford in the 1990s, when the university and its surrounding area became the global center of the tech industry. “If you believe that, then it matters where you are,” Diermeier told me. “Location becomes a strategy.” It’s easier to entice the top computer-science professors to work in the Bay Area than in Nashville. Diermeier expects the San Francisco campus to eventually host 1,000 students and 100 faculty members. (Vanderbilt is also opening a graduate campus in West Palm Beach and recently opened a study-away program in Manhattan.)

Ian Bogost: The accidental winners of the war on higher ed

The education-franchise model—Diermeier calls it “network campuses”—can be a risky proposition. Drexel University, in Philadelphia, tried to improve its reputation by opening a graduate-focused satellite campus in Sacramento. The effort fizzled out six years later. Middlebury College, in Vermont, is similarly winding down its graduate programs in Monterey, California. “It can become like managing an empire,” Stokes said. “It’s like being Rome in the fourth century. If you get too geographically dispersed, it can be difficult to maintain the front of the empire.”

For top schools, the biggest risk might be brand dilution. Ivy League universities are highly unlikely to open new campuses around the country. Their power and prestige depend on exclusivity. The institutions in the next tier down are exclusive, too, but they’re also more willing to experiment. Vanderbilt has less of a national brand to dilute—indeed, that’s the problem it’s trying to solve.

Other top-tier schools will therefore be watching to see how Vanderbilt’s expansion plays out, and some may follow suit. The population of American 18-year-olds is expected to peak this year, followed by a precipitous decline. Stokes’s consulting firm has identified nearly 400 private colleges that are at risk of closure in the next five to 10 years. Everyone’s jockeying to be in the best position on the other side of the crisis. “For institutions like Northeastern and Vanderbilt, taking advantage of this weakening and precarity that certain institutions are experiencing, that creates an opportunity for them to get real estate,” he said. Small colleges in major cities or Sun Belt states, which have seen a population boom, are valuable sites for branch campuses. Aoun said that at least one college asks to be acquired by Northeastern each week. Ryan Allen, an education professor at Soka University of America, calls it higher education’s “Age of Conquest”: The big schools will get bigger, and the smaller schools will be absorbed. Soon, high-school seniors who get accepted into a top college might start having to answer a question that their parents never did: “Which location?”</div>

            <h2>Hegseth’s Firing Campaign Reaches Down Into the Ranks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/hegseth-pentagon-butler-driscoll/686028/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a Pentagon meeting last year, passed a note to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll about one of Driscoll’s top aides, asking, in effect: Why hasn’t this guy been fired yet?

The aide, Colonel Dave Butler, a former infantry officer, is a longtime leader in Army public affairs (not a specialty Hegseth embraces) who worked closely with the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley (whom Hegseth despises). On Thursday, Hegseth finally got his way: Butler was pushed out.

The issue was not that Butler was incompetent in his job; quite the opposite. Both Driscoll and the Army’s chief of staff, General Randy George, are said to have valued his advice, experience, and the reforms that he initiated—and it was their endorsement, when combined with Butler’s previous assignment with Milley, that ruined his chance of making the rank of general.

Defense secretaries don’t usually get involved in decisions about the careers of colonels and other mid-level commanders, given that the lead civilian in the Pentagon is supposed to oversee war planning, a department of 3 million people, and America’s nuclear arsenal. Ever since the World War I era, when the United States established a large-scale standing force, individual branches have typically had a say in promotions and other personnel decisions. These choices are supposed to be based on merit.

Hegseth, more than any other of his predecessors, has weighed in on the makeup of the military’s top leaders. He has fired or sidelined dozens of three- and four-star officers, in many cases without any clear reason other than their perceived disloyalty to Hegseth’s beliefs, alleged support for diversity programs, or coziness with people regarded as foes of the administration.

With Butler’s removal, Hegseth has displayed a willingness to reach further down in the ranks—there are roughly 4,000 colonels in the Army alone—and demonstrated that, one year after his appointment, he still doesn’t feel that his campaign of purges has gone far enough.

“The secretary of defense is spending his time doing things that those well below his pay grade should be doing,” Kori Schake, who directs foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute and released a book last year about civil-military relations, told us. “And he is not doing the things that only the secretary of defense can do.”

Hegseth’s office referred our questions to the Army. The spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in an email that Butler would retire: “His integral role in the Army’s transformation efforts will be missed.”

Butler, who declined to comment, wasn’t a typical colonel. Over the past dozen years, he emerged as a powerful force within the Army as an adviser to the top officers, including Milley, who clashed repeatedly with Trump, particularly after the summer of 2020, when Milley had said that he regretted walking alongside Trump after federal forces cleared Lafayette Square of protesters. Before that, Butler worked under the now-retired General Austin “Scott” Miller, the head of Joint Special Operations Command and a onetime chief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. That put Butler in the room for major decisions both for the Army—he helped organize the Army’s 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, D.C., in June—and for U.S. defense policy more broadly.

More recently, Butler served as a top adviser to Driscoll and George, and he was understood to be highly valued by both men. But Butler was also divisive, in part because of his influence over so many parts of the military—and the public-affairs community.

Hegseth and Driscoll have had a tense year. Driscoll, a confidant of Vice President Vance, has emerged as a rival at the Pentagon to the former Fox News host. Unlike Hegseth—who arrived in his position following a bruising confirmation process that surfaced allegations of mismanagement, heavy drinking, and sexual assault—Driscoll cuts a clean-living profile, has won allies in Congress with his more genial demeanor, and at times has outshone his boss.

While Hegseth has focused on internal purges and the campaign of strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, Driscoll’s star has risen with his participation in U.S. efforts to mediate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Driscoll was in Geneva today on that assignment, working with two of Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. (Driscoll couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.)

After last year’s meeting where Hegseth questioned Driscoll about Butler, both Driscoll and George kept Butler in their inner circle. For the Army, it was not just about protecting Butler’s place. It was also about standing up for Driscoll’s and George’s roles in deciding who leads their force.

Top Army officials, over Hegseth’s objections, decided to keep Butler in the promotion queue during the past year. But Hegseth’s stonewalling of Butler’s advancement was one reason that a larger group of proposed promotions, which needed sign-off from Pentagon leadership before being sent to the White House, was delayed for months, defense officials told us. Some Army officials had hoped that the extra time would ultimately benefit Butler. But after another meeting between Hegseth and Driscoll on Thursday, Driscoll followed Hegseth’s order and removed Butler. “The Army delayed this inevitable decision and in the end Hegseth said, ‘Enough’s enough,’” one defense official told us.

Butler’s ouster wasn’t primarily a result of Hegseth’s rivalry with Driscoll, according to people familiar with the situation. Rather, they said, it stemmed more from Hegseth’s antipathy toward military officials closely associated with Milley. Hegseth and Trump have both accused Milley of treason, and Trump once suggested that Milley should be executed. One of Hegseth’s first actions after taking office was removing Milley’s official portrait from its place in a Pentagon hallway. Earlier this month, Hegseth replaced General James Mingus, the Army’s widely respected second in command who also had worked on the Joint Staff under Milley. Hegseth installed General Christopher LaNeve, one of his own aides, in the post. LaNeve supported the decision to remove Butler, a former defense official told us.

Hegseth and his staff have shown a particular interest in Pentagon PR. An Air Force colonel who served as spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Dan Caine was removed over a years-old social-media post asking for better support for Afghans as U.S. forces withdrew. Hegseth also censured Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, after the retired Navy captain published a video urging troops to refuse unlawful orders. And Hegseth implemented a rule that effectively required reporters to seek Pentagon approval before publishing stories or they would risk losing their press accreditation, leading hundreds of journalists to walk out in the fall.

News of Butler’s ouster appeared to have the effect that Hegseth desired as word spread across the military’s public-affairs community. Officials told us that they feared angering Hegseth and also saw his interference as a direct contradiction of what the military teaches its commanders: that strong leaders focus on the job the military needs them to do, not on anyone else’s role.

“Hegseth’s decision speaks to a broader effort to shape the long-term trajectory of the military,” one former defense official told us. “By getting involved at the colonel rank, Hegseth could reshape the military three, five, seven, even 10 years down the road.”

Such micromanaging in the officer ranks because of political or personal animus risks further polarizing the military and undermining its status as one of America’s final refuges from hyper-partisanship.</div>

            <h2>Do Not Be Cynical About Jesse Jackson</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/jesse-jackson-legacy-race/686030/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I was growing up in Washington, D.C., in the 1990s, many businesses proudly kept in their windows signs from Jesse Jackson’s 1984 and ’88 presidential runs. He was a revered figure, someone people in D.C. were deeply thankful for.

“Nothing will ever again be what it was before,” the writer James Baldwin said after Jackson’s ’84 Democratic National Convention speech.

“It changes the way the boy on the street and the boy on Death Row and his mother and his father and his sweetheart and his sister think about themselves. It indicates that one is not entirely at the mercy of the assumptions of this Republic, of what they have said you are, that this is not necessarily who and what you are. And no one will ever forget this moment, no matter what happens now.”

Yet when you turned on the television, you saw another Jesse Jackson. This Jesse Jackson was a dangerous man, a radical, a demagogue, someone who thrived off fomenting racial division. To the people around me, Jackson—the reverend and civil-rights leader—was a hero. But to the people I saw discussing the news on television, he was both an incendiary agitator and a ridiculous, almost comic, figure. The subtext of all this commentary was that Black Americans would make more progress if their leaders were not so flawed. Barack Obama put the lie to this argument; squeaky-clean by personal-conduct standards, all he did was drive the same people who hated Jackson more insane.

“Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?” the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh mused in the 1990s. His opinions on Obama were no less unhinged.

Ali Breland: The Epstein emails show how the powerful talk about race

“There has developed among many, for sure, a kind of attitudinal air-barrier of cynicism” around Jackson, Marshall Frady, a journalist and the author of Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson, once said. “Part of it is, no doubt, a reflection of the abiding, if not steadily deepening, racial schism in the country since the ’60s.” Jackson was one of Martin Luther King Jr.’s youngest lieutenants; he came of age when many considered racial injustice history, an issue the country had already dealt with. He reminded Americans that King’s dream had not yet come, and that created for him enemies. In hindsight, it seems strange that people would assume that the effects of centuries of slavery and segregation would be entirely wiped away in fewer than two decades. Jackson had grown up in poverty in the shadow of Jim Crow segregation; it must have seemed even more absurd to him.

It was common for right-wingers to refer to him as a “race pimp” or “race hustler.” He did himself no favors when, in 1984, he used an anti-Jewish slur—calling New York City “hymietown”—in a conversation overheard by a reporter. Jackson apologized for the ugly remark, but it followed him for the rest of his life—in mainstream media, the incident was practically a second appellation, right after “the Reverend.” In 1989, the Fox News founder Roger Ailes, then an adviser to Rudy Giuliani’s mayoral campaign, placed an ad in a Yiddish newspaper with a photo of Giuliani’s rival David Dinkins next to Jackson—the two were friends. The clear implication was that Dinkins was an anti-Semite, just like Jackson. In this way, Jackson became an easy shorthand propagandists could use to terrify white people into voting Republican.

Yet this caricature of Jackson as an anti-white, anti-Semitic demagogue never reflected the man. The entire point of Jackson’s “Rainbow Coalition,” his vision of Americans from all backgrounds coming together for social justice, was overcoming such differences. Jackson’s political vision was always inclusive, always multiracial, and always opposed to bigotry and prejudice of all kinds, even if the man himself sometimes fell short.

For one thing, Jackson’s egalitarianism and support for a strong welfare state—including universal health care—did not contradict his emphasis on personal responsibility and the importance of the Church in Americans’ lives. As Frady notes, the South Carolina reverend was constantly hammering on these conservative-friendly themes, long before they became part of Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton’s presidential campaigns.

“Black Americans must begin to accept a larger share of responsibility for their lives. For too many years we have been crying that racism and oppression have kept us down,” Jackson wrote in The New York Times, in 1976. “That is true, and racism and oppression have to be fought on every front. But to fight any battle takes soldiers who are strong, healthy, spirited, committed, well‐trained and confident.”

The 1984 speech that so moved Baldwin remains one of the greatest articulations of American liberalism ever made. But I was too young to remember it, and it is his 1988 speech that I find indelible. In 1984, Jackson described America as a “quilt” with “many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread.” In 1988, he extended the metaphor—arguing that progress could not be made without the aid of people from very different backgrounds, with very different identities.

“Farmers, you seek fair prices and you are right—but you cannot stand alone. Your patch is not big enough. Workers, you fight for fair wages, you are right—but your patch of labor is not big enough. Women, you seek comparable worth and pay equity, you are right—but your patch is not big enough,” Jackson said. “Students, you seek scholarships, you are right—but your patch is not big enough. Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are right—but our patch is not big enough.”

Many obituaries have emphasized Jackson’s hunger for publicity. He was, indeed, no wallflower. But neither did he simply pose for the cameras. Jackson’s decades of activism demonstrated that he was sincere about his vision. When workers were striking, Jackson was there. When it was unpopular to support LGBTQ rights, Jackson did so anyway. When both conservatives and liberals were outraged over illegal immigration, Jackson insisted on mercy and understanding for the undocumented. Despite the “hymie” incident, Jackson never stopped condemning the evils of anti-Semitism, even as he supported Palestinian rights and statehood. Before Pat Buchanan or Donald Trump ran for president, Jackson was condemning “American multinationals” who “hire repressed labor abroad and fire free labor at home.&#39;&#39;

The critics who caricatured him did not understand this sincerity—or perhaps they understood it far too well. His commitment to the people he once described as “the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised,” was real, and he dedicated his life to it.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

Jackson’s sincerity eventually overcame the stereotypes about him. In the early 1990s, only a third of white Americans viewed him favorably; by 1999, that number was close to 60 percent, including, The New York Times reported, many “self-described conservatives.”

Democratic leaders credited Jackson’s work registering Black voters with making otherwise-difficult gains in the wilderness of the Reagan era. He was a genuinely transformative figure, inspiring not just a generation of Black voters but Black officeholders, helping usher in an era of Black self-determination that eclipsed the previous peak during Reconstruction a century earlier. His exhortation to “keep hope alive” in an era of backlash was precisely what he did. Frady quotes former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown calling Jackson “the Jackie Robinson of American politics,” who would “spawn a whole lot of Little Leaguers in many cities and counties that you and I will never hear about.” That was, we now know, an understatement.

The epithet of “race hustler” or “race pimp” can be more accurately applied to many of Jackson’s critics, who perceived his multiracial populism as a threat. They tried to neutralize that threat by turning Jackson into a racial caricature that could be exploited to fan the fears of white Americans that they would be dispossessed, the same inversion of American history that continues to drive right-wing politics in the present. They did not make a caricature of Jackson because he was ridiculous; they tried to make him ridiculous because his vision was so powerful.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Stephen Colbert’s Late Show ends in May, and he’s in almost open warfare with his soon-to-be ex-bosses at CBS. Last night, he had planned to broadcast an interview with James Talarico, a member of the Texas state House who is running in a heated Democratic primary for United States Senate. But it was not to be.

At the start of his show, Colbert told viewers that CBS had barred him from airing the interview, citing threats from Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. (You may remember Carr as the guy who sounded like a cartoon mobster while trying to get Jimmy Kimmel fired—“We can do this the easy way or the hard way”—drawing a rebuke from Senator Ted Cruz.)

Colbert savaged CBS. He said that the network had told him not to talk about it, which he defied in dramatic fashion. “I want to assure you, ladies and gentlemen—please—I want to assure you, this decision is for purely financial reasons,” he joked, a sly reference to the rationale that CBS gave for ending his show. Colbert posted the interview on his show’s YouTube channel. CBS said in a statement that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep. James Talarico. The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.”

I wrote in July that CBS’s leadership had lost the benefit of the doubt, and the network’s actions since its parent company’s merger with Skydance and the appointment of Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News have reinforced that. CBS deserves plenty of criticism for cowardice. But that doesn’t mean it’s incorrect to fear FCC action.

Last month, the FCC issued a notice about the equal-time rule, a century-old regulation that says that a broadcast station that provides time to one candidate must provide an equal forum to a rival. The rule has an exemption for “bona fide news”—basically, producers can decide what to cover in their programming, because anything else would constitute government interference in the free press. In 2006, the FCC determined that interviews on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno fit under the exemption even if they are not strictly news programming, a precedent that shows have relied on since.

But the new notice states that “the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” (Carr has not extended this reasoning to talk radio, which conservatives dominate.) This is not just bluster. Earlier this month, Fox News reported that the FCC was investigating ABC’s daytime talk show The View, which has become an important stop for politicians seeking to reach the show’s heavily female audience, for violating the equal-time rule. The reported object of Carr’s ire? An interview with one James Talarico.

The Talarico dustups are among several incidents in the past few days that show the Trump administration’s enthusiasm for censoring speech by both the press and ordinary citizens. One year ago, I wrote that Donald Trump and his allies were free-speech phonies who, having campaigned against censorship, were eager to impose it. The threat to First Amendment rights has gotten worse since then.

Earlier this month, The Washington Post’s John Woodrow Cox reported on a retiree who used a publicly available email address to encourage an attorney at the Department of Homeland Security to have mercy on an asylum seeker. In response, DHS sent federal agents to the man’s door and demanded access to his Google accounts, using a tool called an administrative subpoena that doesn’t require a judge or grand jury to approve. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta in recent months have received “hundreds” of administrative subpoenas from DHS seeking access to information about the accounts of people who have criticized the government. (DHS told both papers that it was acting within its authority but didn’t give any detailed response.)

The goals of both DHS and the FCC in these cases are to intimidate critics and stifle dissent. This is staggering hypocrisy. During the presidential campaign, Trump accused the Biden administration of undermining free speech by asking—though not demanding—that social-media companies remove misinformation about COVID. On day one of his administration, Trump issued an executive order that charged, “Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve.” This is a good description of what Trump’s administration is doing now.

Some repression efforts fail. Last week, the federal district-court judge Richard Leon, a President George W. Bush appointee, temporarily blocked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from punishing Senator Mark Kelly, a Navy veteran, for a video in which he and other members of Congress remind current service members that they can and should refuse illegal orders. “This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon wrote.

The ruling is a welcome defense of Americans’ freedoms, but it can’t reverse all of the damage. Kelly is unusually well positioned to fight back and take the administration to court. Not every would-be critic is. And censorship, once established by a president, has ways of spreading its tendrils to other institutions. At one state university in Texas, for example, a philosophy professor was forced to remove passages of Plato from his syllabus because of new policies passed by governor-appointed regents, and an art exhibition critical of ICE was abruptly canceled at another Texas university.

These attacks are clearly partisan: They all target speech by critics of the president, his party, or his policies. But they should be scary even if you feel that Colbert doesn’t deserve a news exemption, The View is too liberal, or Kelly was out of line. Crackdowns on speech by prominent figures pave a way for the government to regulate speech more broadly, which should be concerning for people of any political leaning because the party and people in power can change.

During a Senate hearing last week, Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, accused Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, of being responsible for the deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good because he supported protests. Johnson began, “Did you ever encourage people to go out there and exercise the First—”

“I freely admit being in favor of the First Amendment,” Ellison shot back. This position is apparently not as common among elected officials as you might hope.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The most striking passages in Picky, a forthcoming book by the historian Helen Zoe Veit, describe the way famous 19th-century American figures ate as children. I found myself gripped with envy as I read—not because the foods were particularly appetizing, but because I would kill for my kid to eat like that.

To wit: As a girl, Edith Wharton adored oyster sauce, turtle, stewed celery, cooked tomatoes, and lima beans in cream. Mark Twain fondly remembered eating succotash, string beans, squirrels, and rabbits on his uncle’s farm. And during her childhood, Veit writes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton “happily ate vegetables, hickory nuts, and cold jellied brain.”

If these don’t sound like typical “kid foods,” that’s because they aren’t, and weren’t. “Kid food,” as a category, is a recent invention.

Read. In Toni Morrison’s novels, she located the missing stories of Black America, Judith Shulevitz writes.

Reminisce. David Sims explores how Robert Duvall could carry a film thunderously, yet also stand out in the subtlest of roles.

Don&#39;t try and market it as meat, and I&#39;ll give it a chance. You lie and market it as meat and I&#39;ll avoid forever. The definition of meat is the flesh of a living being. Just because it is protein simulating meat doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s meat. Also, I have just as much of an issue with frozen dinners calling something beef or chicken or pork when it has fillers in it. In my opinion to be able to legally use those terms (meat, beef, pork, chicken) it has to be 100% of those things except for possible hydration and spicing. Fillers should automatically force it to be called meat substitute or at least something understood to have fillers like meatloaf or something like that. Pressed and formed meat like substance can F right off.

It was also worse for you in a lot of ways, so that only left vegans that didn&#39;t care about their health or their wallet as the market.

It has to *look* like a nice juicy steak at the grocery steak.And smell and taste like one.

If it&#39;s in a tub or a frozen cube, forget it.

Traveled to the mecca of NotMeat (California) some years ago.  Tried my first Impossible Burger then.  It actually tasted decent.  The claimed environmental impact was &quot;95% less land, 74% less water, and creates 87% fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional ground beef.&quot;   The problem wasn&#39;t trying to sell the product with those environmental savings, which 99% of city slickers living in the concrete jungle barely give a shit about beyond a social media post.

mRNA research is decades old now. Only during the pandemic did it get additional funding and resources to be viable. You probably do more damage to your body via ionizing radiation in a passenger jet than from this vaccine.

mRNA vaccines can&#39;t permanently alter your DNA.  They instruct your cells to make proteins and that&#39;s all.  Even this US government website [genome.gov] admits that.

Someone who clearly has NOT done any research into mRNA, what it is, what it does, and how much your body produces all the time.

I hear some 10x their productivity. There is no doubt that is true. In some cases, AI -10x their productivity, too. (How productive they were beforehand is left as an exercise to the reader).

It had no impact on them or their companies BUT it has increased employment and productivity for Nvidia, Anthorpoc, Open AI, Microsoft etc...It increased production, not productivity. That are two different measurements.

The problem with all those productivity gains by IT is that they are mainly in the administrative part of production. Yes, you can churn out more reports per time. But no one can eat reports, live in reports, cloth himself with reports or build reports into a car. Actual productivity gains are industrial, not administrative. How much has IT improved the construction of houses? How much has IT improved the planting of food crops

Nobody could have predicted this. Well, except anybody with a working mind at a bit of understanding of IT history.

The next AI Winter will be a frigging ice-age!

It never fails to amaze me how little executives of tech companies actually know about tech.  Here is an example of them being taken for trillions because of it.

Indeed. &quot;Managers&quot; with no clues about their products and how their organizations work.

Self-reporting, perception based study from a very narrow and short sampling but doesn&#39;t actually measure productivity.

It&#39;s what we have to work with right now, subjective assertions about the effectiveness of the technology in various fields.  This also goes for advocacy, and is extra distorted because the stratospheric valuations that need to be justified as well as common revulsion, annoyance, and fear associated with LLMs.

Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.This makes no sense to me. Are you telling me that in 1948, when a record or file was requested, and then...A paper requisition was created and physically delivered (IE via the mail), the requisition was sorted by hand to eventually reach the correct person, who then went into a set of records to determine if the person requesting the file was allowed to access it, then that order went to some warehouse of files where the physical file was located, then a physical copy was made of the file, then the process

There were some big post-war spikes, but also a lot of negative growth before 1983.

That&#39;s supposed to be more efficient than nearly instantaneous access via computerized records?I suppose that whatever gains we made by computerizing everything, we lost them by requesting much more documentation than before. Times of old used to be simpler, bureaucracy had time and resource limits. Now with information technology, we are drowning in a deluge of requests, documents, etc., which have grown boundlessly precisely because there are no time and resource boundaries anymore. In a way it&#39;s a variation of what Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away.

No, they didn&#39;t.  100% of employees are employed.  Always.  By definition.

No, it actually makes sense if a few of the employees were previous unemployed.

..the Recession they were paid to deny for the last few years.

The MSM should be in prison for their complicity.

It&#39;s only when you treat datacentres or AI as something special that the problems start.

It&#39;s just another app, why does that mean they get free reign on polluting rivers, or first dibs on power provision, or are able to override planning laws that have been in place for a hundred years?  It&#39;s nonsense.

It&#39;s not AI that&#39;s causing those problems.  It&#39;s people literally corrupting the law for quick profit, as always.

If there&#39;s no power / permission / water for a new hospital?  Guess what?  We shouldn&#39;t be autho

&#39;Because a lot of companies just aren&#39;t hiring waiting to see if AI can replace those jobs.&#39;

Lots of companies do lots of things. Lots of companies hire AI experts etc. to see if there is any there there.

Lots of companies are hiring for lots of reasons.

Lots of companies are not hiring because they decided they have too many employees already, or are doing things that do not need to be done, or not doing them well enough, or should be doping something else more important

The stat is based on the past. But the new models they are real good. You&#39;ll see in 6-18 month all jobs are gonna be done by AI.Chat GPT 5.x was terrible but now we&#39;ve got Chat GPT 5.x+1 and now it&#39;s reall good!

Yes but the capitalist overlords need you to function enough so that they can replace you with AI. Somehow it makes sense.

The lack of hope is weighing heavily on a lot of younger people. They can&#39;t see a way to affording their own home, or children, or a retirement. The climate is getting worse and not nearly enough is being done about it.

Modern society, bullshit jobs, city life, lack of exposrue to nature and the ever-present destruction of the planet... If you are not depressed, something is wrong with you.We&#39;ve heard all this before. It was called melancholia in ancient times. Your post reminds me of an old statement that insanity is the only sane response to society. Similar to your claim that anyone who isn&#39;t depressed has something wrong with them.

I&#39;m not saying depression did not exist before modern society. I&#39;m saying there&#39;s endless reason for a lot more of it these days.But you did  that  as a person who isn&#39;t depressed, there is something wrong with me. Your willingness to cast judgement on others who are perhaps not like you is not a good look.

There are a lot of things in the news that make me feel upset, but at no time recently have I had to fight for my life or been cold or hungry.  I think we have it pretty good compared to our ancestors.

Society is the cause of depressionThat is way too vague. Not everything in society is bad, on average it is probably good. 
So I will tell you a specific thing in society that causes depression: sometimes managers think that if you are happy, you are not working hard. They have no competence or ability to recognize if their underlings are doing good work, so they use the heuristic that if you are happy, you are not working hard. Obviously as a heuristic it&#39;s poor. 
Then these managers start treating everyone like their underlings, including

I wonder why that got downvoted. In its core, it is not wrong. It&#39;s just not completely true, either, and as someone who&#39;s already had depressive episodes which kept me unable to work for weeks or even months, I wouldn&#39;t agree to the suggestion that we should refrain from administering antidepressants...

You cannot cure that with a pill.No, but you can provide profit to another of the overlords by pretending a pill will cure it, and maybe feeling a tiny little less shit in the process. Or at least faking yourself out and learning how to chemically ignore the pain.

There&#39;s are many factors, including physical and electro- and bio-chemical factors.

Some of these factor are treatable.  Some, like society, aren&#39;t.

Unlike ayahuasca, DMT is not nearly as likely to make you vomit.From what I&#39;ve read, DMT has quite varied effects based on the amount. And probably the source, since DMT is present in many natural sources.As far as the vomiting, let&#39;s be a little more honest.  Trying to compare a DMT study done in a controlled environment with known dosages to the average ayahuasca trip is a bit like comparing a professional medical autopsy in a hospital to roadkill.  Results may vary?  No shit.  The drunk guy who introduced you to the ayahuasca sommelier living in a tent was just diggi

(I know you were not trying to be very serious, so don&#39;t take it as a criticism). My experience with relatives who were informal caregivers is more variedIn one case, my friend was the niece of the affected person, who supposedly had not met in a long time. The patient was therefore constantly (repeatedly) happy to rejoin with her long-lost niece.In another case, the affected person was constantly concerned of not being in her house (she was in elderly care during the day), and being separated from her husband (already deceased). The disease had to be a confusing and stressful experience, being in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people for reasons she could not understand.

The endangerment finding named in the link above is about carbon dioxide

The endangerment finding named in the link  [nih.gov] above is about particulate pollution (PM_2.5) and does not mention carbon dioxide. Quote:

Coal-burning power plants are a major source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased risk of death. ...The researchers calculated that for every 1 g/m3 increase in coal PM2.5, mortality increased by 1.12%. This is more than twice the risk that was previously associated with general PM2.5 exposure from all air pollution so

I tease people about being anti-nuclear when coal and natural gas pump more radiation into the air than nuclear ever did, even from accidents. I still use natural gas for cooking, and I can&#39;t go outside without breathing coal pollution (the nearest power plant is coal). Sometimes I even use a coal grill.

radiation from coal represents a miniscule fraction of total annual exposure, estimated at less than 0.1% of total background radiation

A lot of people did very well out of burning fossil fuels. I don&#39;t just mean the mine owners and oil companies, I mean a lot of ordinary people enjoyed cheap cheap energy. They really don&#39;t want that to change, and seem to think it did them no harm. They have also been convinced that renewables aren&#39;t cheaper, when they clearly are, and that electric stuff like cars and heat pumps don&#39;t work.

History is going to tell an almost unbelievable story of how millions were convinced to trash the planet. I thought my cat was an idiot for chewing up the carboard box he liked to live in, but here we are...

Fossil fuels are globally subsidised to the tune of $11 million every minute, according to the International Monetary Fund. That money has to come from somewhere, and there&#39;s no way in hell a billionaire is subsidising some soccer mum&#39;s SUV. Which mean that the money has to come out of taxes.

So it&#39;s not particularly cheap, net. It&#39;s just that the total cost is diffused across the food you buy, the house you own, the car tags, the money you earn. All of these different taxes contribute some percentage of the

This is bull.  The figure of $11 million every minute includes about 90% implicit subsidies.  Implicit subsidies are like saying &quot;gas should cost $10 so it is subsidized by $7&quot;  There is no actual subsidizing happening in implicit subsidies.

So pollution is OK then? In fact you appear to support pollution. It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s a good thing.

Stop breathing for 5 minutes and you will feel better.

Don&#39;t you have some street corner to be ranting on?

Here&#39;s basically the same stuff from 5 years ago https://www.nature.com/article... [nature.com]

Also, a link to the study [plos.org], and not the interpretation of some half-educated journo and his chat-gpt friend is always appreciated.

I assume burning trees for energy does about the same thing to the air as forest fires.

Seems like smoking, either tobacco or cannabis, would also increase AD risk.

Trump’s “Board of Peace” emerged from last year’s ceasefire negotiations to govern Gaza after the war. But since then, the board has evolved into a motley group of countries that are willing to pay a billion dollars to join a body that has Donald Trump as its chairman for life. They also have mostly stopped talking about Gaza.

Two American politicians drew top billing at this past weekend’s Munich Security Conference, where U.S. and European political leaders gather each year to mull the state of the trans-Atlantic alliance—a topic that is now teeming with suspense and peril.

The headliners were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Europeans hoped Rubio would mollify their concerns about President Donald Trump’s commitment to the continent’s defense—or at least erase the memory of last year’s main speaker, J.D. Vance, whose unabashed hostility toward the Western alliance and firm embrace of Germany’s neo-Nazi party set off the crisis between the two continents today.

In this context, they viewed AOC as a possible harbinger of the U.S. leadership’s next generation and wondered—some with excitement, some with dread, almost everyone with curiosity, because she had never appeared at the conference before—just what her ascension might bode.

As it turned out, Rubio proved disappointing, while AOC was too vague to leave behind an outline of the alliance’s future or her chances of rising to its helm—though she expressed reassuring sentiments with (for the most part) encouraging eloquence.

Rubio received a standing ovation at the end of his keynote address on Saturday, mainly because he spoke softly and uttered a few welcome lines that the likes of Vance or, worse still, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (who did not attend the conference) would never utter—for instance, “the United States and Europe … belong together,” “We are part of one civilization,” and “Our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.”

These lines inspired his interlocutor, at the start of a Q&A period, to note “the collective sigh of relief throughout this hall” during the secretary’s “message of reassurance and partnership.”

But those listening with more jaded ears, and nearly everyone who read the transcript afterward, saw it as what might be called Vance-and-Hegseth lite—warm and friendly in tone but pure MAGA in substance, or as Politico paraphrased his message: “Join Donald Trump’s campaign to reshape the world for Washington’s benefit, or get out of the way.”

The traditions that Rubio invoked, in recalling the alliance’s past, were those of nationalism (a subtle rebuke to the European Union, an open rejection of free trade, and a dismissal of international law), Western civilization as Christian civilization (ignoring not just Judeo-Christian heritage but the roughly 25 million Muslims who live in Europe), and the “unapologetic” mission “to build a vast empire out across the globe.”

His call for alliance unity was an invitation for “you” (Europeans) to “join us” (Trump’s America) on our path. His speech—at the world’s most preeminent security conference—did not mention Russia, NATO, or China, but instead listed as the West’s biggest dangers “fear of climate change, fear of war, fear of technology,” and the “mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.” To renew our alliance, he said, means to “restore a place in the world” that will “rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”

We’ve heard this phrase “civilizational erasure” before, from Trump himself. It translates, pretty explicitly, to Make America (and now Europe as well) White Again.

After his appearance in Munich, as if to confirm this impression, and to splash water on those who tried to interpret the speech as a beacon of hope, Rubio flew to Budapest, where he publicly embraced Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and told him, “I say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success, because this relationship we have here in central Europe through you is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come.”

Rubio’s wish for Orbán’s “success” should be viewed in two contexts. First, the prime minister is facing a tough election; Rubio’s words amounted to an open endorsement by Trump. Second, Orbán is universally seen as the EU’s outlier—the Union’s most outspoken critic of democracy, supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and opponent of military aid to Ukraine. In wishing for Orbán’s success, Rubio was thumbing his nose at the entire spectacle—the very purpose—of the Munich Security Conference. Basically, he was repeating, through his actions, Vance’s aggressively hostile speech last year.

If Rubio had gone to Munich after Hungary, the gist of his speech would have been grasped without illusion. Even before the speech, he gave what should have been seen as a hint of his real intentions by brushing off a meeting, which he’d been scheduled to attend, on the security of Ukraine.

Usually several members of Congress attend the Munich conference, though this time House Speaker Mike Johnson barred the funding of their flights, in anticipation of the impasse that froze the Department of Homeland Security’s budget. Still, a few made their own way, notably Sen. Lindsey Graham—who, at one session, said, “Who gives a shit who owns Greenland? I don’t.” (Too bad he couldn’t have summoned the courage to say that a month ago, when Trump threatened war over the question). A few politicians who are assumed to have presidential aspirations also managed to attend: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (who stressed the vital relations between her state and Canada), California Gov. Gavin Newsom (who proclaimed that his state still observed tight laws on greenhouse gases), and the aforementioned AOC.

AOC was the big curiosity, and the two panels where she spoke—one on populism, the other on U.S. foreign policy—were hot tickets. She had never been to the conference before. She was there to lay out a vision of an alternative, progressive foreign policy—and therein lay the mystery: What is a progressive foreign policy in the era of Trump?

A decade ago, progressives would have been, and still would be, anti-war, but would they now support NATO and the armament of Ukraine, if just to distinguish themselves from MAGA isolationists? And how would a progressive fit the U.S. into Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assertion of “middle” nations’ power in his speech earlier this month at the Davos conference?

Before this weekend, I had never heard AOC speak at length, without a script, on foreign policy (or many other topics), and, following the panels streamed on YouTube, I found her for the most part impressive. She argued that income inequality fueled the resentment that triggered the rise of right-wing populism. She noted (as did Carney, though less pointedly) that the “rules-based order” has always excluded the poor from its benefits and the powerful from its obligations, and mused that, contrary to those who say we’re in a “post-rules-based order,” we might be in a “pre-rules-based order.” The real question, in any case, was “rules for whom.” She advocated a “working-class-centered” policy, in part for its own sake, in part to “stave off authoritarianism.” She supported firm commitment to allies, especially those that share our values on human rights and democracy, and adherence to treaties, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans had signed them.

She didn’t quite explain what a “working-class” foreign policy might entail. (President Joe Biden talked about “a foreign policy for the middle class,” tying the idea to an industrial policy that let the U.S. compete with China in high tech; it’s unclear whether AOC would go there.) Nor did she address how a commitment to alliances would affect the balance between social spending and defense spending. In that realm, she (already famously) fumbled a question on whether she’d defend Taiwan from an attack (though, in fairness, the “strategic ambiguity” of U.S. policy on that question is confusing even to seasoned experts—she just hadn’t been briefed on the proper clichés to utter).

She still needs some seasoning in this sphere, but this was her first exposure, and she’s just 36 years old. She could acquire another 30 years of seasoning and still emerge younger than Trump was the first time he ran for president.

But just as Rubio revealed his true colors on his first stop after Munich, AOC made what could turn out to be her most enduring impression after the conference as well. Rubio stood alongside Europe’s most authoritarian leader, in Budapest. AOC met and spoke with some of its most prominent left-liberal leaders, in Berlin.

She spoke first to leaders of Germany’s Social Democratic Party/SPD and then to its Left Party/Die Linke—both full-house events, mainly about leftish issues, which they had rarely heard about from an American politician, especially one as prominent as AOC.

But apart from the issues, AOC stressed the importance of sticking together. Whatever they might try to accomplish, she said at the first event, the approach “has to be coalitional.”

We have to grow our ranks … because if we go separately, we will lose it all. … Everyone has something to give here, and that’s why I’m proud to meet with Die Linke tomorrow and to be here with SPD today, because we cannot let the right win.

This was a stern message to the two groups of German politicians, who have sharp divisions, despite knowing very well that, a century ago, similar divisions between social democrats and socialists abetted the rise of Hitler. Today, SPD and Die Linke together hold 19 and 10 percent of the seats in Germany’s parliament, respectively. The far-right-wing party, the AfD, holds 24 percent. (The centrist Christian Democratic Union holds 33 percent, and the Green Party holds 13 percent.) Together, the two left-leaning parties outflank AfD; apart, they can get crushed.

AOC is pursuing the same theme back in Washington. Back in 2018, when she was first elected as a Bernie Sanders–type democratic socialist, she formed a huddle with a few like-minded House members who called themselves the Squad. Now she is a power- and coalition-builder, even helping to raise money for centrist Democrats—who ask her for help, knowing that they need her constituents to push them over the edge, just as AOC knows she needs the moderates to push her agenda.

The U.S. probably hasn’t shifted quite left enough to elect AOC president in 2028. (It’s questionable whether she could even win upstate New York in a race for the Senate.) But domestic alliances are shifting, just as global alliances are shifting. In weighing the contestants for America’s top leadership positions, it’s worth noting that Trump, Rubio, and Vance endorse Orbán and the AdF—while AOC tries to unify the SPD and Die Linke.

Which of these sides should America be on?

Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to allow reasonable time for detainees at the Whipple detention center in Minneapolis to access legal counsel. In a 41-page decision, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel excoriated the government for policies and practices that “all but extinguish” a detainee’s right to counsel. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to professor Linus Chan, the James H. Binger Clinical Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota and the faculty director of the Detainee Rights Clinic, where he represents people who are being detained by ICE or in danger of being detained by ICE.

Dahlia Lithwick: The Justice Department will likely appeal this order, but in the meantime, how much of a difference will this make for folks swept up by ICE in Minnesota, assuming they get 72 hours before being removed to Texas, per the new order? What kind of a difference will this make for clients like yours?

Linus Chan: It’s going to be a huge difference. But also, it’s just returning things to the status quo. And I will be frank, it’s not as if the status quo was a paragon of attorney access, but at the same time, there had always been an operative norm that detainees should be able to talk to their lawyers and not suddenly be transported out of state with no ability to let their loved ones know what’s going on, and even themselves maybe not knowing what’s going on. So this is really important.

Under the old processes, they would get detained, and then they would go through what’s called processing—they might have their biometrics done, there might be an interview with an officer to confirm information that they have in the system, and after that conversation, they would then be put in a holding area for a few hours, and then put into one of the county jails in Minnesota. Most of the time the person’s stay for detention would be either in Minnesota or around the Midwest.

One of the big departures in current practice from what it was in the past was that ICE’s logistical acumen has reached the point of arresting someone at, let’s say, 9:00 in the morning and having them on a plane by noon. It was working like clockwork. People were not going through that longer process I described. They were going very, very quickly, and they could find themselves suddenly in El Paso or New Mexico, most often in Texas because the detention capacity in Texas has grown a lot.

Now, let’s assume this is a client of yours. Even if you knew they were at the Bishop Whipple building, there was no easy way to contact them. If you went online to the detainee locator, a lot of the time it would say the person is in custody, but it would not tell you where they were. It would direct you to call ICE at this number. Of course I’ve done this, I’ve called the number, and nobody ever picks up. It’s just a dead number. So then you have no idea at all what’s going on, but you do know how quickly they have put people on an actual plane out of the country, and have done so even when they legally should not be able to.

On top of that, we have a Trump administration that says that even if they know that it was a mistake, they don’t have to correct that mistake. Once a person is no longer in U.S. custody, they say this is a foreign-power problem, and they don’t have any means to fix it if they are out of the country.

The biggest source of concern and trauma comes from family members who are trying to figure out whether their family member has been kidnapped or whether they’re in immigration detention, and they can’t find out for several hours. So the fact that we have this order that is both trying to make sure that there is attorney access as well as to slow that process down, of transfers, can be tremendously important and powerful. It also gets into another issue which was in terms of habeas access.

Do you want to talk about how that’s changed? Because it seems to me that’s a cornerstone. I think people glaze over because it seems hypertechnical, but this is really where the rubber meets the road.

Habeas, the great writ, is in our Constitution, it’s an English tradition that predates our country, and it’s the general idea that if the government wants to imprison someone, then at some point or another, they need to justify that imprisonment. And if that imprisonment violates any law, and in this case, the United States, violates the Constitution, then a court can order that person to be released.

The history of the writ of habeas corpus and immigration is a very long one. In fact, it goes all the way back to the Chinese exclusion cases, back in the 1860s, 1870s, 1880s, where the federal government was trying to exclude Chinese people from coming to the United States, even if in some cases they were U.S. citizens or had the proper documentation. The way that people would challenge the laws or challenge the policy was through the writ of habeas corpus. There was a period of time. before what’s called the administrative period, where the writ of habeas corpus was the only way to challenge an order of deportation. Let’s say you were ordered deported and you now faced banishment from your country. The only way to get a judge to look at it was to give a writ of habeas corpus.

In the intervening years, there’s been a shift that started most dramatically in the late 1990s, where Congress really did not want immigrants to file writs of habeas corpus to challenge removal orders. So they started to take away the ability of courts to do that. In 2005, there was passage of what’s called the Real ID Act, which was a post- 9/11 piece of legislation that came from this idea that the problem with immigration enforcement was too much review, that there was too much legal process. So they cut it off and basically said that no court can look at the lawfulness of immigration deportation orders, even through habeas, that there is one way, and the only way is through what’s called a circuit court review, having the federal appellate courts eventually review it. That was a huge dramatic change.

But it didn’t prevent people from arguing that their detention was unlawful, while it prevented people from arguing that their removal or their deportation order was unlawful. And that has become so important, because this administration is deliberately using detention as the tool and as the weapon to try to push as many people out as possible. And they are explicit about this. When the students were getting notices that suddenly their visas were being revoked, they were getting letters that said, By the way, if you don’t want to end up detained, you might want to leave now. On the CBP One Home app, they say, You don’t want to get detained, right? Go ahead and sign up to get $1,000 and leave. There’s a reason they are gleefully talking about all the money that they’re using to build detention camps, because it’s driving that.

When they expand detention, when they go back on the former norms, there’s only one way to actually get people to examine whether they could do those things or not, and that’s through the writ of habeas corpus. The writ of habeas corpus, as powerful as it is—and it is—has become more and more difficult to use thanks to layers of  legal doctrines lately.

One of them is what’s called the immediate custodian rule. That is, you can only file a habeas in the district court where they are actually being detained. When I referenced earlier how people didn’t know where they were going, how quickly they were getting transferred, that has become one of the controversies between litigants, the court, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I had this situation where a client of mine was detained one morning, and I filed habeas the next day—this is before it became clear how quickly out-of-state transfers were happening. I filed habeas, and looked my client up on the detainee locator. I couldn’t find her, her family didn’t know where she was, they couldn’t call her, no one knew where she was, and no one was picking up. This was a weekend. ICE had picked her up on Saturday. I filed the habeas corpus on Sunday. Their first reply to that habeas corpus was: You filed in the wrong court. By the time you filed it, she was already in Houston. The case in question, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, said you have to file habeas within the district of confinement, which meant that I was supposed to have filed it in Houston, even though I didn’t know where she was.

The conditions of detention and the scope of what is coming is the end in itself here, because the administration wants people to self-deport. What we are really seeing here is a weaponization of the detention itself. Detention has become the objective, and the crueler the detention, the bigger the win for this administration.

One of the things that’s always been remarkable, and I use the word remarkable because I kind of get stuck on these adjectives, is that as a child growing up as a Gen Xer, there was always this idea of freedom—the American view that we are a free country. If you look at what freedom means, it seems pretty axiomatic to think, Freedom means not being put in jail. But what I think has really become true generally in our society, and now more specifically with immigration, is that we’ve gotten so used to this idea that we can be detained, that we can be imprisoned, that there are all these justifications that the government has to imprison us.

It wasn’t until, I would argue, one of the most important decisions in the 1980s, which justified denying criminal bail to people, that really led to this idea that as long as the government says you’re a danger and you’re a flight risk, you are going to have to disprove it before you can be released. Even though the criminal system has a very important idea that the burden should be on the government, and not on the person being detained, and many immigration folks are trying to push the immigration system to more resemble that burden, if you speak to most on-the-ground criminal defense attorneys, it’s just words on a piece of paper. There has been an unfortunate acceptance of the idea that it’s OK to be detained.

Look at Minnesota, where they are arresting protesters or arresting observers, then they might spend eight hours or overnight, and then be released in negative-20-degree temperatures in the middle of a park without any of their possessions or their phone. That has happened. And then the government is not even bothering to charge them because they don’t think that they actually can make a good case. It’s just another example of how we’ve accepted as a society that when people get arrested, there must be good reason to do it. That’s amazing to me. Doesn’t that completely strike at the heart of us being a free country?

The fact that they could, as has happened here, literally break down the doors to our homes and arrest us without a warrant and then haul us in, and then the only thing we’ll get after they release us after several hours is not even an apology. It shouldn’t shock me but it does. They killed two people with witnesses and video recording in Minneapolis. They won’t apologize for that. So of course they’re not going to apologize for shooting a woman five times in Chicago. They’re not going to apologize for taking people and putting them in a cell for eight hours and then releasing them with no justification. They are not apologizing for the amount of trauma that they are imposing. They believe they’re unaccountable. That’s the thing that I think we really need to try to fix.

The United States government has begun construction of a multibillion-dollar detention camp system in the newest phase of Stephen Miller’s mass deportation strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two megawarehouses to be converted into 8,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, with reported plans to buy and convert more than a dozen other warehouses for “processing” masses of new detainees. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick discussed, with journalist Andrea Pitzer, the clear and chilling picture of what the Trump administration is building. Pitzer is the author of several books, including One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, and her most recent newsletter post is “Building the Camps: The Warehouseification of Detention and Initial Thoughts on Stopping It.” The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: What is being built? At what speed is it being built? At what cost is it being built? How is it that we’re at the place where the language that you use in your post, concentration camps, actually is not just apt but has become fairly obvious?

Andrea Pitzer: The U.S. already had a pretty extensive immigration deportation system. In the first Trump administration, the White House wanted to prioritize the kinds of optics that signaled that it could go after anybody at any time. That led to a sort of a Keystone Cops approach, and so the numbers of people deported were in fact lower than under Barack Obama. But the optics of things like family separations and the deliberate cruelty were really apparent. The administration learned from that first outing that it needed to do more planning and be more strategic. Now that Donald Trump has returned to office, we’re still seeing a lot of Keystone Cops stuff that the administration probably didn’t intend for people to see, but we’re also seeing a lot of deliberate cruelty on the streets that it does intend for people to see.

Meanwhile, the White House is hoovering up warehouses. Before all these warehouse purchases, there was a turn toward facilities like Camp East Montana, which is this enormous facility that was stood up just last August within Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas. They were literally building it out with tents as they were bringing people in. They’ve decided that it doesn’t really meet their needs, and so they are now turning to acquiring these warehouses. There are over 100 the administration in the process of working toward. It’s spent about three-quarters of a billion dollars on buying these so far.

The infrastructure of all that is extraordinary. When you look at some of the biggest concentration camp systems across the world, we are actually approaching or ahead of the numbers for those massive famous ones. The Nazis came to power in 1933 and immediately, within weeks, had opened Dachau—which, I will note, was founded on a converted factory site—so we’re echoing this history right from the beginning. It was not until about five and a half years later, with Kristallnacht, that they started doing large sweeps of German Jews into camps. In that 48-hour period, more than 30,000 Jews were sent into concentration camps. That was five years into Nazi rule.

We are at the end of the first year of this second Trump administration. And even when you look at, let’s say, 1940 to 1941, World War II had started, Germany was putting a lot more people into camps, and yet we have more people in immigrant detention today than Nazi Germany did seven years into the Third Reich, which I think is just astounding when you think about it.

Even before he was elected, Trump was talking about this mass deportation campaign, that there were up to 20 million people in the United States illegally. Historians debate how many people moved through the Soviet gulag, whether it was 18 million or 20 million people in more than two decades who went through that system. What the Trump administration is talking about are those numbers in a four-year period. If you know anything about how horrific the Soviet gulag was, you’ll recall that it transformed the country for generations that followed, and it wrecked lives.

The Soviets didn’t know in advance what they were doing, but Stephen Miller has that context. That is something key people in the administration are openly embracing. We are already seeing conditions in those camps that rival early Nazi concentration camps, with illness, disease, and reports of limited access to medical care. We’ve had a killing in Camp East Montana that has been declared a homicide. People have already died.

This is not something this administration stumbles into sideways, right? This was the plan. Last April, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was heard to say that what he really, really wanted to do was to just run deportations like a business: “Like Amazon Prime, but with human beings,” he said. We are witnessing the construction of a system for just warehousing people systematically. How much of what we are seeing playing out right now is just the tip of the iceberg for what is imagined?

If we look at that “Amazonification,” different concentration camps evolved over time in different ways. I often use the Nazi example because it’s almost the only concentration camp system people know, even though there have been a bunch of different ones. The Nazis were the very first who took this logistical approach that we think of as Amazonification now. There was a detainee named Margarete Buber-Neumann, who wrote an amazing memoir, Under Two Dictators. She was detained in the Soviet gulag system, then later held in the Nazi concentration camp system. The Soviets handed her over to the Gestapo at the beginning of World War II, and she describes coming to the Nazi camp system and being issued clothes and utensils to eat with. It was this whole system that was very sadistic, but it was incredibly scripted and organized. Of course, that went to hell once the war started, but this warehouse-ification of people was exactly the initial Nazi goal. The extermination of people through that warehouse system became the later explicit goal.

In terms of what our government is doing, I want to make clear: This can happen in a country only when things have been deeply wrong for a number of years in a number of ways. What we’ve already seen in the U.S., with prisons, with decades of demonizing immigrants, with the already existing nature of our punitive immigration system, where detention is literally used as a deterrent and to do harm to people—all that gives Trump these initial tools that they are clearly planning to expand on in tremendous ways.

People are waking up to what’s happening on the ground, which is amazing and offers all kinds of potential for things to do. But I don’t think people understand the scope of it. If they end up with all these warehouses, what automatically follows from that is you have transit camps and you have hub camps and you have whole communities whose identities become bound up with these warehouses. This is why we see some of these small towns and cities already working to reject the Immigration and Customs Enforcement warehouses. Dachau is the name of the town. Just think, for how many places in our country is that what is going to be meant by their names going forward?

According to the plans that we see from Miller and Trump, this will be as large as—and potentially even larger than—the U.S. prison system, which is already so much larger than almost anything else in the world. It will exist almost entirely outside the realm of oversight, of accountability. Concentration camp systems are always an end run around the existing legal system in a country at a given time. This isn’t just going to be criminal detainees. We’re already seeing people with documentation disappearing in this system, people who are here lawfully. We have seen U.S. citizens that have ended up in some of these settings. The goal is never to do detention against just the targeted group. The goal with these is always political: the expansion of political power and the entrenchment of political power. By definition, that means that other people will be going into these camps over time. The objective is really expanding and locking down control over public life in America. It is the ability to silence any kind of dissent.

Americans are waking up to the reality of horrifying dispatches from Camp East Montana, located near El Paso, Texas: reports of hunger, of violence, of sexual assault, of death. Who is accountable for this?

I think everybody involved has to run the risk of accountability. The sooner we can shut down the largest wave of this as it’s growing, the smaller that number will be. And it is better not only that less harm comes to people; even on the other side of this, the fewer people who will have to be held accountable in some way, the better it is for society. So even for the perpetrators, it is better if we can shut this down, but especially for the people that would have harm done to them.

It may be hard to imagine accountability in this moment, when so many systems are collapsing, but I think of the people I talked to in Argentina who had been tortured and held. In some cases, they had been sexually assaulted, their friends killed. There was never a hard end where the military made itself accountable there. The dictatorship ended, but there was never this moment of accountability. That came years later. One woman I interviewed remembered that while she was blindfolded, she was able to peek under her blindfold and see a tile pattern on the floor. When it came time to testify, they testified to everything that they could remember. Somebody went and found that tile pattern, and they found the floor, they found the house she had been held in, and they talked to the neighbors, and the neighbors recalled hearing the screams. They were able to work their way through these unbelievably difficult investigations to bring leading military figures to justice, but also people underneath them.

You have to, first of all, for PR purposes, make everybody think they’re going to be accountable for everything going forward. Then, in the end, on the other side of this, you decide how you deal with the small potatoes. But there is going to have to be some kind of accountability. It was a serious shame from the Obama era that this was not done when he came to power in early 2009, in the face of what had happened in the war on terror. The lack of accountability at that point has enabled much of what has followed. Obama’s not personally responsible as if he had launched the war on terror himself, but he bears some of that responsibility, because without those accountability moments, this is exactly where you end up.

Reforms are good, for sure, but if you’re focused on them, the correct response to Dachau was not better training for the guards. So we can talk about better training, and we can talk about standards, but that ultimately is not going to be what addresses this. Everybody needs to face accountability.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A survey of almost 6,000 corporate execs across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia found that more than 80 percent detect no discernible impact from AI on either employment or productivity.

The study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in Massachusetts is based on input from CFOs, CEOs, and executives at enterprises of different sizes across the four countries.

On average, 69 percent of businesses currently use some form of AI, and 75 percent expect to use it over the next three years. Typical uses include &quot;text generation using large language models,&quot; followed by &quot;visual content creation&quot; and &quot;data processing using machine learning.&quot;

The impact of AI on employment and productivity is limited, according to those polled. More than 90 percent of managers say AI had no impact on employment at their organization over the past three years, and 89 percent saw no change in productivity (measured as volume of sales per employee).

Despite this, many execs anticipate significant consequences over the next three years, including reduced employment. NBER estimates this will hit about 1.75 million jobs across all four nations by 2028.

The respondents also expect their businesses to become more productive by about 1.4 percent over the next three years due to AI. This implies a reversal of the long-run decline in productivity growth in many advanced economies, the authors state.

The report also notes that employee expectations differed from the senior execs, in that workers expected to see more jobs created as a result of AI over the next three years, along with smaller productivity gains.

The NBER paper joins a growing body of evidence indicating commercial benefits of adopting AI are just not living up to their promises - at least not yet. A recent survey of more than 4,500 business leaders by consultants at PwC found that more than half reported seeing neither increased revenue nor decreased costs.

Research from professional services firm Deloitte uncovered that 74 percent of organizations want their AI initiatives to grow revenue, but only 20 percent have seen that happen.

A trial of Microsoft&#39;s M365 Copilot by a UK government department, published in September, found no gain in productivity, with some tasks speeded up while others were hampered by it.

At the same time, Jared Spataro, the exec who leads Microsoft&#39;s AI at Work efforts, admitted he was struggling to highlight return on investment (ROI) for Copilot because a lot of knowledge work doesn&#39;t translate directly into top-line or bottom-line figures.

That hasn&#39;t stopped others at Microsoft from making bold claims, though. Just this month, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman said most tasks that involve &quot;sitting down at a computer&quot; will be fully automated by AI within the next year or 18 months. He listed accounting, legal, marketing, and project management, according to Fortune.

Lenovo claimed recently that enterprises across Europe and the Middle East are accelerating their adoption of AI, with 94 percent of those surveyed expecting to see a positive return on their investment, despite growing evidence to the contrary.

A survey published by Gartner today found that organizations expect AI to transform customer service, enhancing the customer experience with humans continuing to provide judgment.

It also says that 91 percent of customer service leaders are under pressure from management to implement AI.

Nearly 80 percent of firms are planning to move at least some agents into new roles, due to the expected automation of routine tasks, while there is still a need for human expertise in &quot;complex or emotionally sensitive&quot; interactions. Gartner says 84 percent of leaders plan to add new skills to the agent role to support this shift.

All of this points to the likelihood of very modest productivity gains from implementing AI, in stark contrast to the hundreds of billions being plowed into developing these systems by the technology giants. It&#39;s small wonder they are so keen for everyone to persevere with deployments, amid promises of jam tomorrow. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Generative AI tools are surprisingly poor at suggesting strong passwords, experts say.

AI security company Irregular looked at Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, and found all three GenAI tools put forward seemingly strong passwords that were, in fact, easily guessable.

Prompting each of them to generate 16-character passwords featuring special characters, numbers, and letters in different cases, produced what appeared to be complex passphrases. When submitted to various online password strength checkers, they returned strong results. Some said they would take centuries for standard PCs to crack.

The online password checkers passed these as strong options because they are not aware of the common patterns. In reality, the time it would take to crack them is much less than it would otherwise seem.

Irregular found that all three AI chatbots produced passwords with common patterns, and if hackers understood them, they could use that knowledge to inform their brute-force strategies.

The researchers took to Claude, running the Opus 4.6 model, and prompted it 50 times, each in separate conversations and windows, to generate a password. Of the 50 returned, only 30 were unique (20 duplicates, 18 of which were the exact same string), and the vast majority started and ended with the same characters.

Irregular also said there were no repeating characters in any of the 50 passwords, indicating they were not truly random.

Tests involving OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2 and Google&#39;s Gemini 3 Flash also revealed consistencies among all the returned passwords, especially at the beginning of the strings.

The same results were seen when prompting Google&#39;s Nano Banana Pro image generation model. Irregular gave it the same prompt, but to return a random password written on a Post-It note, and found the same Gemini password patterns in the results.

The Register repeated the tests using Gemini 3 Pro, which returns three options (high complexity, symbol-heavy, and randomized alphanumeric), and the first two generally followed similar patterns, while option three appeared more random.

Notably, Gemini 3 Pro returned passwords along with a security warning, suggesting the passwords should not be used for sensitive accounts, given that they were requested in a chat interface.

It also offered to generate passphrases instead, which it claimed are easier to remember but just as secure, and recommended users opt for a third-party password manager such as 1Password, Bitwarden, or the iOS/Android native managers for mobile devices.

Irregular estimated the entropy of the LLM-generated passwords using the Shannon entropy formula and by understanding the probabilities of where characters are likely to appear, based on the patterns displayed by the 50-password outputs.

The team used two methods of estimating entropy, character statistics and log probabilities. They found that 16-character entropies of LLM-generated passwords were around 27 bits and 20 bits respectively.

For a truly random password, the character statistics method expects an entropy of 98 bits, while the method involving the log probabilities of the LLM itself expects an entropy of 120 bits.

In real terms, this would mean that LLM-generated passwords could feasibly be brute-forced in a few hours, even on a decades-old computer, Irregular claimed.

Knowing the patterns also reveals how many times LLMs are used to create passwords in open source projects. The researchers showed that by searching common character sequences across GitHub and the wider web, queries return test code, setup instructions, technical documentation, and more.

Ultimately, this finding may usher in a new era of password brute-forcing, Irregular said. It also cited previous comments made by Dario Amodei, CEO at Anthropic, who said last year that AI will likely be writing the majority of all code, and if that&#39;s true, then the passwords it generates won&#39;t be as secure as expected.

&quot;People and coding agents should not rely on LLMs to generate passwords,&quot; said Irregular. &quot;Passwords generated through direct LLM output are fundamentally weak, and this is unfixable by prompting or temperature adjustments: LLMs are optimized to produce predictable, plausible outputs, which is incompatible with secure password generation.&quot;

The team also said that developers should review any passwords that were generated using LLMs and rotate them accordingly. It added that the &quot;gap between capability and behavior likely won&#39;t be unique to passwords,&quot; and the industry should be aware of that as AI-assisted development and vibe coding continues to gather pace. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla has complied with an order by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and stopped using the term &quot;Autopilot&quot; in its marketing of electric vehicles, having already modified use of &quot;Full Self-Driving&quot; to clarify that it requires driver supervision.

The California DMV confirmed Tesla&#39;s &quot;corrective action&quot; on February 17, 2026, with director Steve Gordon saying:

&quot;The DMV is committed to safety throughout all California&#39;s roadways and communities. The department is pleased that Tesla took the required action to remain in compliance with the State of California&#39;s consumer protections.&quot;

This comes after Tesla was given 60 days from December 16, 2025 to fall in line with the agency&#39;s request.

The requirement followed a lengthy case over Tesla&#39;s use of the words &quot;Autopilot&quot; and &quot;Full Self-Driving&quot; in relation to its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), along with the sentence: &quot;The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver&#39;s seat.&quot;

The marketing dates back to May 2021. The California DMV said yesterday: &quot;Vehicles equipped with those ADAS features could not, at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles.&quot;

The Administrative Law Judge proposed suspending Tesla&#39;s manufacturing and dealer licenses for 30 days. However, a later review gave Elon Musk&#39;s EV outfit 60 days to stop using the terms.

Tesla has now taken the required action and &quot;In doing so, Tesla avoids having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended by DMV for 30 days,&quot; the California agency said.

The Register contacted Tesla for its response to the California DMV&#39;s statement, but it has yet to reply. The company&#39;s website shows marketing for Full Self-Driving (FSD) with the word &quot;Supervised&quot; displayed alongside it.

Tesla&#39;s automotive fortunes are ailing. CEO Elon Musk said last month it would shift the Fremont, California, manufacturing facility from Model S and X vehicles (due to be discontinued this year) to Optimus robots, which presumably won&#39;t fall under the purview of the California DMV.

The Register asked Tesla if it plans to make similar changes to marketing in other states or regions. ®

            <div id="article-text">Josh Simons, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for the UK government&#39;s digital identity program, is being probed by the department for his actions running a Labour think tank that commissioned an investigation into journalists.

UK Prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has ordered the government&#39;s propriety and ethics team to look into his minister&#39;s actions at the think tank, Labour Together, saying he &quot;didn&#39;t know anything&quot; about the investigation.

Between 2022 and his election as a Labour MP in 2024, Simons ran Labour Together, which supported Starmer&#39;s leadership campaign. Its founder, Morgan McSweeney, served as Starmer&#39;s chief of staff until his resignation earlier this month for his role in appointing former US ambassador Peter Mandelson, under fire for exchanges released in the Epstein Files.

In 2023, Labour Together commissioned US public affairs outfit APCO Worldwide to investigate Sunday Times journalists who wrote about the think tank&#39;s failure to declare £730,000 (c $990k) in donations, according to the newspaper.

The Sunday Times claimed the resulting report from the US firm suggested the journalists had used hacked emails provided by Russia. The report also discussed the fact that one of the reporters, Gabriel Pogrund, is Jewish, and the newspaper asserted that it was also &quot;falsely suggesting its journalists might be part of a Russian conspiracy.&quot;

The think tank passed a version of the report, without the information on Pogrund, to GCHQ&#39;s National Cyber Security Centre, which decided against launching a full inquiry.

Simons told the paper that he was &quot;surprised and shocked&quot; that APCO Worldwide had included &quot;unnecessary information&quot; on the journalist, which he asked to be removed before he passed the report to GCHQ.

Liberal Democrat MP Lisa Smart called for Simons to stand down temporarily while the investigation takes place. &quot;It looks like the group that credits itself with getting Labour into government has carried out an outrageous attack on our independent free press,&quot; she said in a statement.

Simons is leading the government&#39;s efforts to introduce digital identity, launched last September by Starmer, with digital ID initially proposed as compulsory for right-to-work checks. Following widespread opposition, he dropped it as a requirement in January, although said these right-to-work checks would be digitized.

The government is planning to launch a consultation on its revised plans for digital ID, but in the meantime Simons has been answering written parliamentary questions from MPs on the scheme.

Earlier this week, asked by Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake how people who refuse a digital ID card will be able to complete right-to-work checks, Simons replied that checks &quot;will be digital and they will be mandatory&quot; with technical details to follow in the consultation. ®

            <h2>Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/18/godot_maintainers_struggle_with_draining/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rémi Verschelde, a maintainer of the open source Godot game engine, is the latest to complain about the impact of &quot;AI slop PRs [pull requests]&quot;, which he says &quot;are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for Godot maintainers.&quot;

His post was prompted by a comment from Adriaan de Jongh, game designer and director of small gaming company Hidden Folks, who said that LLM-generated PRs for Godot are a &quot;massive time waster for reviewers ... changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don&#39;t understand their own changes ... it&#39;s a total shitshow.&quot;

A comment noted that the Blender 3D design project is facing the same issue and has recently proposed an AI contributions policy, following others including the Linux Foundation, Fedora, Firefox, Ghostty, Servo and LLVM.

Verschelde appealed for &quot;more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop,&quot; and also spoke of the conflict between being welcoming to new contributors to let &quot;any engine user have the possibility to make an impact&quot; while also dealing with the onslaught of useless PRs.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how long we can keep it up,&quot; he said.

GitHub itself is to blame, according to some comments, since the company is a big AI advocate. &quot;This platform incentivizes this kind of behavior,&quot; said one; and another that it &quot;is just exhausting to watch all this play out and GitHub promoting this, not fighting it.&quot;

Linux distro Gentoo is in the process of migrating from GitHub to Codeberg thanks to &quot;continuous efforts to force Copilot usage for our repositories.&quot;

One project, the self-hosting toolkit Coolify, has created an Anti Slop GitHub Action, which its developer claims &quot;could have closed 98 percent of slop PRs.&quot; The developer is not opposed to AI itself, and stated that &quot;AI is one of the best things to ever be released and when used with experience and properly according to project guidelines it will pass all checks.&quot;

GitHub director of open source programs Ashley Wolf acknowledged the problem of &quot;what happens when low-quality contributions arrive at scale&quot; last week, though choosing her words carefully so as not to blame AI itself. According to Wolf, &quot;maintainers have always dealt with noisy inbound.&quot; Nevertheless, GitHub is introducing features to make AI slop easier to deal with, including PR deletion from the GitHub UI (user interface) which she said is coming soon.

Wolf also mentioned relevant features that have already shipped, including the ability to limit PRs to collaborators or disable them entirely. And maintainers can enforce temporary interaction limits for specific users.

Further refinements are under consideration. Wolf mentioned criteria-based gating, such as requiring that a PR be linked to an existing issue, or defining other rules that contributions must meet. There is also the inevitable suggestion that AI can be used to fix the problem it created, via automated triage.

Wolf&#39;s post follows the creation of an official GitHub discussion on the subject earlier this month, as we reported. A GitHub product manager contacted us to state that &quot;we don&#39;t think counting AI-generated PRs is the right metric,&quot; showing again the tension between the company&#39;s strong promotion of AI and the evidence of the damage it is doing to open source. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Notepad++ has continued beefing up security with a release the project&#39;s author claims makes the &quot;update process robust and effectively unexploitable.&quot;

Version 8.9.2 adds verification of the signed XML returned by notepad-plus-plus.org. Combined with verification of the signed installer, introduced in version 8.8.9, the update process now validates both the instructions and the payload - the basis for the &quot;unexploitable&quot; claim.

According to the project&#39;s author, a state-sponsored cybercriminal compromised the editor&#39;s update service. Security researchers attributed the attack to a Chinese government-linked espionage crew called Lotus Blossom. The hack selectively redirected some update traffic to an attacker-controlled site serving malware disguised as a legitimate update to victims.

A &quot;hardened&quot; version of the editor was released on December 9, 2025, followed by a release that dropped the use of a self-signed certificate on December 27. With laudable transparency, the project&#39;s author followed up the releases with a post explaining what had happened, stating that the upcoming version 8.9.2 would enforce certificate and signature verification. Less than a month later, here we are.

The author also noted additional hardening for the auto-updater, WinGUp. The libcurl.dll dependency was removed &quot;to eliminate DLL side-loading risk,&quot; plugin management execution has been restricted to the program signed with the same certificate as WinGUp, and two unsecured cURL SSL options, CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST and CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE, have been removed.

The author added: &quot;Of course, it&#39;s always possible to exclude the auto-updater during the UI installation, or to deploy the MSI package using the following command: msiexec /i npp.8.9.2.Installer.x64.msi NOUPDATER=1.&quot;

Updating to the latest version would therefore seem prudent.

The &quot;Double-Lock&quot; design is intended to make the Notepad++ update process more robust, although the &quot;effectively unexploitable&quot; statement feels a little like a gauntlet being thrown at the feet of miscreants. ®

            <h2>Waymo denies using remote drivers after Senate testimony went viral</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The robotaxi company has come under scrutiny for its use of remote assistants, some of whom are based in the Philippines.

The robotaxi company has come under scrutiny for its use of remote assistants, some of whom are based in the Philippines.

Waymo defended its use of remote assistants for its robotaxis after the testimony of one of its top executives during a Senate hearing went viral. In a letter to Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) on Tuesday, Waymo’s head of global operations Ryan McNamara provided a detailed description of the company’s remote assistance operations, including the number of employees based overseas.

Waymo employs approximately 70 “remote assistance agents,” with half based in the US and the other half in the Philippines, McNamara said. These agents “provide advice only when requested by the [automated driving system] on an event-driven basis,” the letter states. “Waymo’s [remote assistance] agents provide advice and support to the Waymo Driver but do not directly control, steer, or drive the vehicle.”

“Waymo’s [remote assistance] agents provide advice and support to the Waymo Driver but do not directly control, steer, or drive the vehicle.”

Waymo has been on the defensive after numerous outlets reported on the Senate testimony as if the company had revealed some terrible secret about its robotaxi operations. During the hearing, Markey pressed Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, about the use of remote assistants, asking whether any of these workers were based overseas. “The Waymo phones a human friend for help,” Markey said during the hearing, adding that the vehicle communicates with a “remote assistance operator.”

Peña’s response that some agents were stationed in the Philippines then went viral, as numerous news publications and social media accounts mischaracterized his statement as meaning the vehicles were being controlled by remote drivers overseas.

But in his letter, McNamara says these agents do not control the vehicle, nor are they passively watching the live video feeds from the robotaxi cameras in case anything goes wrong. “Rather, the ADS reaches out to Remote Assistance when the vehicle encounters an ambiguous situation in which it may benefit from more context, even if the ADS can confidently proceed — a helpful safety redundancy,” he writes, adding that these interactions “typically last only seconds.”

Waymo’s remote assistants in the Philippines are all licensed drivers, English speakers, and have passed drug screenings, McNamara assures Markey: “These agents are provided extensive training tailored to the specific tasks they will complete and their performance is closely monitored, and despite never remotely driving the vehicles, are trained on local road rules.” He also claimed that latency between the vehicle and the assistant is insignificant, presenting it as “approximately 150 milliseconds for US-based centers and 250 milliseconds for [remote assistance] based abroad.”

Remote assistants are used for tasks such as “simple vehicle occupancy or cleanliness checks to suggesting paths around obstacles,” McNamara stated. These workers are distinct from Waymo’s Event Response Team, who are deployed when a Waymo vehicle is involved in a crash or safety incident. All ERT employees are based in the US and receive special training, he added.

But while Waymo’s remote assistants may not drive the vehicles, there is a “tool” for “a rare set of specific situations” in which the vehicle is stopped on the shoulder of a highway and needs to be moved. In this case, the ERT agent “could prompt the [autonomous vehicle] to move forward at 2 mph for a short distance at fixed steering angles to exit the travel lane,” McNamara writes. To date, Waymo has only employed this tool in training, he added.

Waymo’s remote assistants in the Philippines are all licensed drivers, English speakers, and have passed drug screenings.

McNamara declined to provide Markey the specific number of “invoked sessions” or requests between Waymo’s automated driving system and its remote assistants on a per-mile basis, calling the number “not material” — though he assured the senator that the company keeps detailed records of the frequency of these requests.

McNamara says its “critical” to distinguish Waymo’s operations from autonomous driving companies that do use teleoperators or remote drivers. Tesla, for example, employs remote drivers for its robotaxis as backup when something goes wrong. Later, a steering wheel for remote operations was spotted in the background of a photo of Tesla’s robotaxi control room in Texas. Other companies, like May Mobility, use the Waymo method of having remote assistants who can send suggestions when problems arise.

Waymo’s operations are under increased scrutiny after several safety incidents, including a December power outage in San Francisco that left several of the company’s robotaxis paralyzed in intersections, and an incident in which a child was struck at low speed by a robotaxi in Santa Monica. When a Waymo robotaxi was caught running a red light in 2024, the company said it was because of an incorrect prompt from a remote assistant. It also comes as Waymo and other companies talk a big game about the spread of driverless cars, spurring anxiety among people who are concerned about AI job losses.

“It is not about whether the remote human driver exists, because all robotaxis will need such a person for the foreseeable future,” Phil Koopman, autonomous vehicle expert at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. “It is whether the safety concept for that arrangement is acceptable. For Waymo we have seen a mishap caused by a remote driver error (running the red light). And while we have a lot of claims from Waymo about rigorous operational practices, what we do not have is ongoing independent oversight that what is happening on the ground matches those claims.”

Moreover, as robotaxi operations scale, most people remain unaware or confused about the various levels of autonomy, and their human helpers. Waymo’s vehicles are often described as Level 4, meaning the vehicles do all the driving tasks under specific conditions — but does not exclude all human intervention or assistance. Level 5 is when the vehicle can drive anywhere, under any conditions, without any human help. Most experts agree that this level remains out of reach, in the realm of science fiction.

            <div id="article-text">The state of Nevada claims Kalshi doesn’t have the proper license to operate, while also allowing people under 21 to use its platform.

The state of Nevada claims Kalshi doesn’t have the proper license to operate, while also allowing people under 21 to use its platform.

Nevada is suing to block the prediction market platform Kalshi from allowing residents to place bets on the outcomes of events, including elections and sports games, as reported earlier by Business Insider. The lawsuit adds to a growing number of legal battles across the country, claiming that Kalshi is harming the state’s gambling market by operating without a proper license and by allowing users under 21 to use the platform.

The state of Nevada filed the lawsuit just hours after a federal appeals court denied Kalshi’s request to block Nevada from taking action against the company. As prediction betting platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket become more popular — allowing users to place bets on everything from election outcomes to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro — state lawmakers have had to grapple with how to regulate them. But putting local restrictions on prediction betting markets may prove difficult, as the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is rallying against state-level regulations.

In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, CFTC head Michael Selig argues that state-level regulations “undermine the agency’s exclusive jurisdiction over these markets.” He adds that these “exchanges aren’t the Wild West, as some critics claim, but self-regulatory organizations that are examined and supervised by experienced CFTC staff.” The CFTC also filed an amicus brief in support of Crypto.com’s appeal as part of a legal battle with the state of Nevada over its prediction market offering.

Now, Nevada is asking the court to prevent Kalshi from letting users in the state place bets until it obtains the appropriate license. “Kalshi does not employ adequate safeguards to ensure that wagers are not being placed on an event by owners, coaches, players, or officials participating in the event, and does not communicate about potential evidence of match fixing or point shaving with Nevada gaming regulatory authorities,” Nevada’s lawsuit claims. Kalshi declined to comment.

Prediction markets, including Kalshi, are currently facing at least 20 federal lawsuits over their sports betting offerings, according to The New York Times. Kalshi was dealt a large legal blow last month when a Massachusetts judge ordered Kalshi to stop allowing residents to place bets on sports.

            <div id="article-text">The electric hatchback won’t be as affordable as expected, but it makes up for it with variety.

The electric hatchback won’t be as affordable as expected, but it makes up for it with variety.

Toyota is on an EV roll these days, introducing the newly all-electric, three-row Highlander SUV, and giving us a fuller picture of the bZ Woodland wagon. Now, the Japanese auto giant is completing the triumvirate with a full detail breakdown of the upcoming C-HR hatchback.

We already knew that the C-HR won’t be as affordable as we originally thought, coming in at $38,135 (including destination fee) for the base SE trim. That’s a lot more than the $25,000-$30,000 some experts were expecting, but definitely a lot less than the $50,000 average transaction price for a new vehicle (or $55,000 for average EV). By comparison, the original gas-engine version of the C-HR started at $22,000, while the hybrid model sells for around $41,000.

But while it may not be as approachable as we once assumed, the C-HR aims to make up for it in variety. Toyota says is releasing a variety of powertrain options for the C-HR, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell (only available in California and Hawaii).

The exterior design stands out with its “hammerhead” front end and a wide, planted stance that emphasizes its sportiness. Built on the dedicated e-TNGA platform, the C-HR offers a low center of gravity that enhances the drive quality. A dual-motor all-wheel-drive system comes standard, delivering 338 horsepower and a 0-60 mph acceleration in just 4.9 seconds.

The SE trim offers an EPA-estimated range of up to 287 miles, while the XSE trim, equipped with larger 20-inch wheels, provides an estimated 273 miles. A NACS charging port enables owners to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger network. Under ideal conditions, the 74.7 kWh battery can charge from 10-80 percent in approximately 30 minutes.

The inside features a 14-inch touchscreen running the latest Toyota Audio Multimedia system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. (Early reviews of Toyota’s new software system have not been favorable.) And while the C-HR may be small, it hopefully won’t be cramped, with up to 59.5 cubic feet of cargo space when the rear seats are folded flat.

The C-HR is expected to go on sale in March 2026, around the same time as the bZ Woodland. And once the Highlander arrives later this year, Toyota will suddenly have three EVs to sell to American car buyers. Perhaps its time to finally retire those “Toyota is an EV laggard” takes?

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/880400/pixel-10a-hands-on-a-little-too-much-like-pixel-9a">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a minimal update. Google didn’t bring many Pixel 10 features down to the Pixel 10A this year. Buy the berry color.

Google’s midrange Pixels have been our top pick for budget Android phones for a while. They offer good cameras and most of what you need at a budget-friendly price. But this year’s upgrade feels so minimal, I’d liken it more to a Pixel 9A+. Or a Pixel 9B.

The $499 Pixel 10A is supposed to be a slightly worse Pixel 10. But it’s more like a slightly better Pixel 9A. And that’s a bit of a bummer. Very few of the features that make the Pixel 10 series compelling trickled down to the 10A this year.

You don’t get all the good stuff that makes the Pixel 10 series more compelling. There’s still last year’s Tensor G4 chip and 8GB of RAM, which isn’t enough to power the more advanced AI features Google launched on Pixel 10, like Magic Cue or Pixel Screenshots, the latter of which debuted on the Pixel 9. Do you care? Maybe not! I like Magic Cue, though. And my guess is that skyrocketing RAM prices play a role here. It could explain the lack of additional AI features, but I can’t blame RAM prices for what otherwise feels like a more “meh” update.

So what do you get from the Pixel 10? You also get the 10’s SOS satellite communications, in case you get lost out in the woods, and a bear is chasing you, and you need to point your phone at the sky and tell someone that a bear is chasing you and that you need help.

The Pixel 10A also borrows a couple of new AI tricks, like Auto Best Take (not just Best Take), which automatically selects the best picture from a bunch, like the one where everyone in a group shot is facing the camera. This worked well during a quick test at Google’s office. Similarly, it offers Google’s Camera Coach, which walks you through some ideas on how to take the best picture of a subject. I tested this with a fake orchid, and the suggestions on how to frame it were almost certainly better than anything I’d have thought of because I am not a great photographer and usually just pull out my phone for a quick picture of my kids doing something silly.

You’d be hard-pressed to spot the design differences, so I’ll lay them out for you. Google says it’s its most durable Pixel A-series phone yet. The display is stronger thanks to a new Gorilla Glass 7i covering and gets a bit brighter (11 percent to 3000 nits) at its peak, like when you’re trying to see the screen in the sun. It has the same IP68 waterproofing.

The bezel around the screen is slightly narrower (10 percent narrower, to be exact). The cameras are all the same as last year, but the 13-megapixel and 48-megapixel sensors on the back now lie fully flush with the frame instead of sticking just a hair above it. Even the colors look similar to last year, but the berry color is the best: You won’t find that shockingly bright color on any other phone, and it’s the one you should buy. Other colors include lavender, fog (gray), and obsidian (black). Google’s also launching fog and berry Pixel Buds 2A, so you can match.

The Pixel 10A also doesn’t have PixelSnap, Google’s version of MagSafe that lets you use any magnetic snap-on charger or accessory. That’s a bummer, I love that, and I think it should be here. Still, you get a wee bit faster wired and wireless charging. Wired charging jumped from 27-watts to 30-watts, and wireless charges at 10-watts instead of 7.5-watts.

Preorders for the 10A begin today, and it hits shelves on March 4. It will be available with 128GB or 256GB of storage. A lot of people buy Pixel A-series phones for the pure Android experience and frequent updates. I don’t think they really care about having every last AI or hardware feature Google makes. But it just doesn’t feel like Google brought enough of the Pixel 10 to the Pixel 10A this year. That’s why it’s more like a 9A 2.0.

            <h2>Mark Zuckerberg is taking the stand as social media goes on trial</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/880375/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-los-angeles-social-media-addiction-trial">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">‘I want him to see my face,’ one parent said.

‘I want him to see my face,’ one parent said.

Lori Schott didn’t care what it took to haul her way from her small town in Eastern Colorado to show up to a Los Angeles courtroom where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify Wednesday. “I don’t care if I had to hire a pack mule to get me here, I was going to be here,” she told The Verge outside the courthouse Tuesday.

Schott’s daughter Annalee died by suicide at age 18 in 2020, after struggling with body image issues that her mother says were heightened by social media. After her death, Schott found journal entries where Annalee disparaged her own looks and compared herself to other girls’ profiles. “I was so worried about what my child was putting out online, I didn’t realize what she was receiving,” Schott said.

The way that Meta and Google-owned YouTube designed their products — allegedly luring users into a nonstop loop of taps and scrolling — is at the heart of this month’s bellwether social media trial, which sets the stage for thousands of similar lawsuits. The companies have generally denied the claims. Schott and several other self-described survivor parents have made it their mission to be in the courtroom during the several-week trial in downtown LA.

“I was so worried about what my child was putting out online, I didn’t realize what she was receiving.”

Last week, the parents heard from Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, who used his time to carve a distinction between clinical addiction to social media and what he called “problematic use.” On the stand, Mosseri testified that using Instagram “too much” is a relative thing that can vary person-to-person, and he wouldn’t use the term addiction for using social media up to 16 hours a day. Mosseri explained why Meta had modified a prior ban on image filters that altered users’ appearance, after previously discussing their potential negative mental health effects. While the plaintiff has argued Meta is motivated by profits and engagement at the expense of users’ safety, Mosseri said that the two are aligned. “In general, we should be focused on the protection of minors, but I believe protecting minors over the long run is good for business and for profit,” he said, according to CNBC.

Several parents camped out overnight in the rain to make sure that they would get spots behind Mosseri while he took the stand. One of them was Julianna Arnold, whose daughter Coco died of fentanyl poisoning at 17 after allegedly meeting a dealer on Instagram she believed had sold her Percocet. The parents wore rain ponchos, played cards, drank coffee, and told stories throughout the night. “Everyone was like, you’re crazy,” she said. “But it didn’t feel like we were crazy, because we were so determined to have survivor parents in the courtroom.”

For Schott, who also stayed overnight to see Mosseri’s testimony, the reality of being in the room quickly became overwhelming. “I really hoped in my heart that it wasn’t as bad as it was,” said Schott, who left the testimony early after hearing the Instagram CEO discuss documents about engagement, profits, and internal research about girls’ mental health. “It is that bad.”

“I want him to see my face, because my face is Anna’s face.”

On Wednesday, Zuckerberg will likely expand on Mosseri’s testimony and explain the company’s choices. While Mosseri is in charge of the product at the center of the trial, Zuckerberg’s role as founder and CEO means that the plaintiff’s lawyers will likely ask him to account for choices they allege harmed young users. Zuckerberg will likely be asked about how and why his company made various design decisions, and research it conducted on user safety. But at least as important as what Zuckerberg will say, for many, is that he’ll get to see their faces. “I’d love to look him in the eye,” Schott says. “I want him to see my face, because my face is Anna’s face.”

Zuckerberg’s testimony will likely be referenced at future trials and legislative hearings. Thousands of social media cases behind this one similarly argue that products like Instagram caused various personal injuries, and that companies should be made to pay damages and change their products to make them safer.

Arnold isn’t sure whether she’ll get one of the limited, lottery-assigned seats inside the courthouse. Either way, “I want to see a row of survivor parents in the front row. That he has to testify to our faces, to parents of kids that died because of his lack of care and lack of accountability — that’s why it’s really important that we’re here.”

Executives said ads could have users ‘doubting everything.’

AI search startup Perplexity is distancing itself from ads amid fears users won’t trust chatbots with an agenda to upsell. The move highlights an emerging crossroads for the AI industry as the sector’s biggest players hunt for stable sources of income to bankroll massive spending, with giants like OpenAI leaning into ads and others like Anthropic promising to keep them out.

Perplexity began phasing out ads late last year and isn’t exploring any new ad deals at the moment, executives said on Monday at a roundtable event, according to Business Insider and the Financial Times. It is a noteworthy U-turn for the US startup, which became one of the first generative AI companies to test ads on its platform in 2024.

“The challenge with ads is that a user would just start doubting everything . . . which is why we don’t see it as a fruitful thing to focus on right now,” said an unnamed executive cited by the FT. Instead, the company will focus on producing something consumers are “willing to pay for,” in particular business customers and high-powered users like finance professionals, lawyers, doctors, and CEOs.

Another executive did not rule out a return to advertising in the future, but said serving ads was “misaligned with what the users want” and may not be needed for the company to thrive. “We are in the accuracy business, and the business is giving the truth, the right answers,” they said.

The pivot sets Perplexity firmly on the anti-ad side of the industry’s emerging divide over how AI should make money. Some, like Perplexity, are hoping subscriptions will be enough and Anthropic has committed to keeping its chatbot Claude ad-free. Others, like OpenAI, have embraced ads, and last week, the company started testing advertising for free ChatGPT users. The dispute has moved into the public arena as well, with Anthropic airing attack ads clearly targeting ChatGPT at the Super Bowl, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called “dishonest.”

Welcome to the dark side of crypto’s permissionless dream

Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps.THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe. During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed his true identity as the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? It matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure.Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better. Read the full story.

To be human is, fundamentally, to be a forecaster. Occasionally a pretty good one. Trying to see the future, whether through the lens of past experience or the logic of cause and effect, has helped us hunt, avoid being hunted, plant crops, forge social bonds, and in general survive in a world that does not prioritize our survival.

Today, we are awash in a sea of predictions so vast and unrelenting that most of us barely even register them. People’s desire for reliable forecasting is understandable. Still, nobody signed up for an omnipresent, algorithmic oracle mediating every aspect of their life. A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control. Read the full story.

Hydrogen trains could revolutionize how Americans get aroundLike a mirage speeding across the dusty desert outside Pueblo, Colorado, the first hydrogen-fuel-cell passenger train in the United States is getting warmed up on its test track. It will soon be shipped to Southern California, where it is slated to carry riders on San Bernardino County’s Arrow commuter rail service before the end of the year.The best way to decarbonize railroads is the subject of growing debate among regulators, industry, and activists. The debate is partly technological, revolving around whether hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, or overhead electric wires offer the best performance for different railroad situations. But it’s also political: a question of the extent to which decarbonization can, or should, usher in a broader transformation of rail transportation.In the insular world of railroading, this hydrogen-powered train is a Rorschach test. To some, it represents the future of rail transportation. To others, it looks like a big, shiny distraction. Read the full story.

Trying to see the future, whether through the lens of past experience or the logic of cause and effect, has helped us hunt, avoid being hunted, plant crops, forge social bonds, and in general survive in a world that does not prioritize our survival. Indeed, as the tools of divination have changed over the centuries, from tea leaves to data sets, our conviction that the future can be known (and therefore controlled) has only grown stronger.

Today, we are awash in a sea of predictions so vast and unrelenting that most of us barely even register them. As I write this sentence, algorithms on some remote server are busy trying to guess my next word based on those I have already typed. If you’re reading this online, a separate set of algorithms has likely already served you an ad deemed to be one you are most likely to click. (To the die-hards reading this story on paper, congratulations! You have escaped the algorithms … for now.)

If the thought of a ubiquitous, mostly invisible predictive layer secretly grafted onto your life by a bunch of profit-hungry corporations makes you uneasy … well, same here.

So how did all this happen? People’s desire for reliable forecasting is understandable. Still, nobody signed up for an omnipresent, algorithmic oracle mediating every aspect of their life. A trio of new books tries to make sense of our future-­focused world—how we got here, and what this change means. Each has its own prescriptions for navigating this new reality, but they all agree on one thing: Predictions are ultimately about power and control.

In The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits), the Oxford economist Maximilian Kasy explains how most predictions in our lives are based on the statistical analysis of patterns in large, labeled data sets—what’s known in AI circles as supervised learning. Once “trained” on such data sets, algorithms for supervised learning can be presented with all kinds of new information and then deliver their best guess as to some specific future outcome. Will you violate your parole, pay off your mortgage, get promoted if hired, perform well on your college exams, be in your home when it gets bombed? More and more, our lives are shaped (and, yes, occasionally shortened) by a machine’s answer to these questions.

If the thought of a ubiquitous, mostly invisible predictive layer secretly grafted onto your life by a bunch of profit-hungry corporations makes you uneasy … well, same here. This arrangement is leading to a crueler, blander, more instrumentalized world, one where life’s possibilities are foreclosed, age-old prejudices are entrenched, and everyone’s brain seems to be actively turning into goo. It’s an outcome, according to Kasy, that was entirely predictable.

AI adherents might frame those consequences as “unintended,” or mere problems of optimization and alignment. Kasy, on the other hand, argues that they represent the system working as intended. “If an algorithm selecting what you see on social media promotes outrage, thereby maximizing engagement and ad clicks,” he writes, “that’s because promoting outrage is good for profits from ad sales.” The same holds true for an algorithm that nixes job candidates “who are likely to have family-care responsibilities outside the workplace,” and the ones that “screen out people who are likely to develop chronic health problems or disabilities.” What’s good for a company’s bottom line may not be good for your job-hunting prospects or life expectancy.

Where Kasy differs from other critics is that he doesn’t think working to create less biased, more equitable algorithms will fix any of this. Trying to rebalance the scales can’t change the fact that predictive algorithms rely on past data that’s often racist, sexist, and flawed in countless other ways. And, he says, the incentives for profit will always trump attempts to eliminate harm. The only way to counter this is with broad democratic control over what Kasy calls “the means of prediction”: data, computational infrastructure, technical expertise, and energy.

A little more than half of The Means of Prediction is devoted to explaining how this might be accomplished—through mechanisms including “data trusts” (collective public bodies that make decisions about how to process and use data on behalf of their contributors) and corporate taxing schemes that try to account for the social harm AI inflicts. There’s a lot of economist talk along the way, about how “agents of change” might help achieve “value alignment” in order to “maximize social welfare.” Reasonable, I guess, though a skeptic might point out that Kasy’s rigorous, systematic approach to building new public-serving institutions comes at a time when public trust in institutions has never been lower. Also, there’s the brain goo problem.

To his credit, Kasy is a realist here. He doesn’t presume that any of these proposals will be easy to implement. Or that it will happen overnight, or even in the near future. The troubling question at the end his book is: Do we have that kind of time?

Reading Kasy’s blueprint for seizing control of the means of prediction raises another pressing question. How on earth did we reach a point where machine-mediated prediction is more or less inescapable? Capitalism, might be Marx’s pithy response. Fine, as far as it goes, but that doesn’t explain why the same kinds of algorithms that currently model climate change are for some reason also deciding whether you get a new kidney or I get a car loan.

If you ask Benjamin Recht, author of The Irrational Decision: How We Gave Computers the Power to Choose for Us, he’d likely tell you our current predicament has a lot to do with the idea and ideology of decision theory—or what economists call rational choice theory. Recht, a polymathic professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, prefers the term “mathematical rationality” to describe the narrow, statistical conception that stoked the desire to build computers, informed how they would eventually work, and influenced the kinds of problems they would be good at solving.

This belief system goes all the way back to the Enlightenment, but in Recht’s telling, it truly took hold at the tail end of World War II. Nothing focuses the mind on risk and quick decision-making like war, and the mathematical models that proved especially useful in the fight against the Axis powers convinced a select group of scientists and statisticians that they might also be a logical basis for designing the first computers. Thus was born the idea of a computer as an ideal rational agent, a machine capable of making optimal decisions by quantifying uncertainty and maximizing utility.

Intuition, experience, and judgment gave way, says Recht, to optimization, game theory, and statistical prediction. “The core algorithms developed in this period drive the automated decisions of our modern world, whether it be in managing supply chains, scheduling flight times, or placing advertisements on your social media feeds,” he writes. In this optimization-­driven reality, “every life decision is posed as if it were a round at an imaginary casino, and every argument can be reduced to costs and benefits, means and ends.”

Today, mathematical rationality (wearing its human skin) is best represented by the likes of the pollster Nate Silver, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, and an assortment of Silicon Valley oligarchs, says Recht. These are people who fundamentally believe the world would be a better place if more of us adopted their analytic mindset and learned to weigh costs and benefits, estimate risks, and plan optimally. In other words, these are people who believe we should all make decisions like computers.

How might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment are better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

It’s a ridiculous idea for multiple reasons, he says. To name just one, it’s not as if humans couldn’t make evidence-based decisions before automation. “Advances in clean water, antibiotics, and public health brought life expectancy from under 40 in the 1850s to 70 by 1950,” Recht writes. “From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, we had world-changing scientific breakthroughs in physics, including new theories of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity.” We also managed to build cars and airplanes without a formal system of rationality and somehow came up with societal innovations like modern democracy without optimal decision theory.

So how might we convince the Pinkers and Silvers of the world that most decisions we face in life are not in fact grist for the unrelenting mill of mathematical rationality? Moreover, how might we demonstrate that (unquantifiable) human intuition, morality, and judgment might be better ways of addressing some of the world’s most important and vexing problems?

One might start by reminding the rationalists that any prediction, computational or otherwise, is really just a wish—but one with a powerful tendency to self-fulfill. This idea animates Carissa Véliz’s wonderfully wide-ranging polemic Prophecy: Prediction, Power, and the Fight for the Future, from Ancient Oracles to AI.

A philosopher at the University of Oxford, Véliz sees a prediction as “a magnet that bends reality toward itself.” She writes, “When the force of the magnet is strong enough, the prediction becomes the cause of its becoming true.”

Take Gordon Moore. While he doesn’t come up in Prophecy, he does figure somewhat prominently in Recht’s history of mathematical rationality. A cofounder of the tech giant Intel, Moore is famous for his 1965 prediction that the density of transistors in integrated circuits would double every two years. “Moore’s Law” turned out to be true, and remains true today, although it does seem to be running out of steam thanks to the physical size limits of the silicon atom.

One story you can tell yourself about Moore’s Law is that Gordon was just a prescient guy. His now-classic 1965 opinion piece “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits,” for Electronics magazine, simply extrapolated what computing trends might mean for the future of the semiconductor industry.

Another story—the one I’m guessing Véliz might tell—is that Moore put an informed prediction out into the world, and an entire industry had a collective interest in making it come true. As Recht makes clear, there were and remain obvious financial incentives for companies to make faster and smaller computer chips. And while the industry has likely spent billions of dollars trying to keep Moore’s Law alive, it’s undoubtedly profited even more from it. Moore’s Law was a helluva strong magnet.

Predictions don’t just have a habit of making themselves come true, says Véliz. They can also distract us from the challenges of the here and now. When an AI boomer promises that artificial general intelligence will be the last problem humanity needs to solve, it not only shapes how we think about AI’s role in our lives; it also shifts our attention away from the very real and very pressing problems of the present day—problems that in many cases AI is causing.

In this sense, the questions around predictions (Who’s making them? Who has the right to make them?) are also fundamentally about power. It’s no accident, Véliz says, that the societies that rely most heavily on prediction are also the ones that tend toward oppression and authoritarianism. Predictions are “veiled prescriptive assertions—they tell us how to act,” she writes. “They are what philosophers call speech acts. When we believe a prediction and act in accordance with it, it’s akin to obeying an order.”

As much as tech companies would like us to believe otherwise, technology is not destiny. Humans make it and choose how to use it … or not use it. Maybe the most appropriate (and human) thing we can do in the face of all the uninvited daily predictions in our lives is to simply defy them.

            <h2>Welcome to the dark side of crypto’s permissionless dream</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“We’re out of airspace now. We can do whatever we want,” Jean-Paul Thorbjornsen tells me from the pilot’s seat of his Aston Martin helicopter. As we fly over suburbs outside Melbourne, Australia, it’s becoming clear that doing whatever he wants is Thorbjornsen’s MO.

Upper-middle-class homes give way to vineyards, and Thorbjornsen points out our landing spot outside a winery. People visiting for lunch walk outside. “They’re going to ask for a shot now,” he says, used to the attention drawn by his luxury helicopter, emblazoned with the tail letters “BTC” for bitcoin (the price tag of $5 million in Australian dollars—$3.5 million in US dollars today—was perhaps reasonable for someone who claims a previous crypto project made more than AU$400 million, although he also says those funds were tied up in the company).

Thorbjornsen is a founder of THORChain, a blockchain through which users can swap one cryptocurrency for another and earn fees from making those swaps. THORChain is permissionless, so anyone can use it without getting prior approval from a centralized authority. As a decentralized network, the blockchain is built and run by operators located across the globe, most of whom use pseudonyms.

During its early days, Thorbjornsen himself hid behind the pseudonym “leena” and used an AI-generated female image as his avatar. But around March 2024, he revealed that he, an Australian man in his mid-30s, with a rural Catholic upbringing, was the mind behind the blockchain. More or less.

If there is a central question around THORChain, it is this: Exactly who is responsible for its operations? Blockchains as decentralized as THORChain are supposed to offer systems that operate outside the centralized leadership of corruptible governments and financial institutions. If a few people have outsize sway over this decentralized network—one of a handful that operate at such a large scale—it’s one more blemish on the legacy of bitcoin’s promise, which has already been tarnished by capitalistic political frenzy.

Who’s responsible for THORChain matters because in January last year, its users lost more than $200 million worth of their cryptocurrency in US dollars after THORChain transactions and accounts were frozen by a singular admin override, which users believed was not supposed to be possible given the decentralized structure. When the freeze was lifted, some users raced to pull their money out. The following month, a team of North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group used THORChain to move roughly $1.2 billion of stolen ethereum taken in the infamous hack of the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit.

Thorbjornsen explains away THORChain’s inability to stop the movement of stolen funds, or prevent a bank run, as a function of its decentralized and permissionless nature. The lack of executive powers means that anyone can use the network for any reason, and arguably there’s no one to hold accountable when even the worst goes down.

But when the worst did go down, nearly everyone in the THORChain community, and those paying attention to it in channels like X, pointed their fingers at Thorbjornsen. A lawsuit filed by the THORChain creditors who lost millions in January 2025 names him. A former FBI analyst and North Korea specialist, reflecting on the potential repercussions for helping move stolen funds, told me he wouldn’t want to be in Thorbjornsen’s shoes.

THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators, where two-thirds majority rules.

That’s why I traveled to Australia—to see if I could get a handle on where he sees himself and his role in relation to the network he says he founded.

According to Thorbjornsen, he should not be held responsible for either event. THORChain was designed to make decisions based on votes by node operators—people with the computer power, and crypto stake, to run a cluster of servers that process the network’s transactions. In those votes, a two-thirds majority rules.

Then there’s the permissionless part. Anyone can use THORChain to make swaps, which is why it’s been a popular way for widely sanctioned entities such as the government of North Korea to move stolen money. This principle goes back to the cypherpunk roots of bitcoin, a currency that operates outside of nation-states’ rules. THORChain is designed to avoid geopolitical entanglements; that’s what its users like about it.

But there are distinct financial motivations for moving crypto, stolen or not: Node operators earn fees from the funds running through the network. In theory, this incentivizes them to act in the network’s best interests—and, arguably, Thorbjornsen’s interests too, as many assume his wealth is tied to the network’s profits. (Thorbjornsen says it is not, and that it comes instead from “many sources,” including “buying bitcoin back in 2013.”)

Now recent events have raised critical questions, not just about Thorbjornsen’s outsize role in THORChain’s operations, but also about the blockchain’s underlying nature.

If THORChain is decentralized, how was a single operator able to freeze its funds a month before the Bybit hack? Could someone have unilaterally decided to stop the stolen Bybit funds from coming through the network, and chosen not to?

Thorbjornsen insists THORChain is helping realize bitcoin’s original purpose of enabling anyone to transact freely outside the reach of purportedly corrupt governments. Yet the network’s problems suggest that an alternative financial system might not be much better.

On February 21, 2025, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou got an alarming call from the company’s chief financial officer. About $1.5 billion US of the exchange’s ethereum token, ETH, had been stolen.

The FBI attributed the theft to the Lazarus Group. Typically, criminals will want to convert ETH to bitcoin, which is much easier to convert in turn to cash. Knowing this, the FBI issued a public service announcement on February 26 to “exchanges, bridges … and other virtual asset service providers,” encouraging them to block transactions from accounts related to the hack.

Someone posted that announcement in THORChain’s private, invite-only developer channel on Discord, a chat app used widely by software engineers and gamers. While other crypto exchanges and bridges (which facilitate transactions across different blockchains) heeded the warning, THORChain’s node operators, developers, and invested insiders debated about whether or not to close the trading gates, a decision requiring a majority vote.

“Civil war is a very strong term, but there was a strong rift in the community,” says Boone Wheeler, a US-based crypto enthusiast. In 2021, Wheeler purchased some rune, THORChain’s Norse-mythology-themed native token, and he has been paid to write articles about the network to help advertise it. The rift formed “between people who wanted to stay permissionless,” he says, “and others who wanted to blacklist the funds.”

Wheeler, who says he doesn’t run a node or code for THORChain, fell on the side of remaining permissionless. However, others spoke up for blocking the transfers. THORChain, they argued, wasn’t decentralized enough to keep those running the network safe from law enforcement—especially when those operators were identifiable by their IP addresses, some based in the US.

“We are not the morality police,” someone with the username @Swing_Pop wrote on February 27 in the developer Discord.

THORChain’s design includes up to 120 nodes whose operators manage transactions on the network through a voting process. Anyone with hosting hardware can become an operator by funding nodes with rune as collateral, which provides the network with liquidity. Nodes can respond to a transaction by validating it or doing nothing. While individual transactions can’t be blocked, trading can be halted by a two-thirds majority vote.

Nodes are also penalized for not participating in voting, which the system labels as “bad behavior.” Every 2.5 days, THORChain automatically “churns” nodes out to ensure that no one node gains too much control. The nodes that chose not to validate transactions from the Bybit hack were automatically “churned” out of the system. Thorbjornsen says about 20 or 30 nodes were booted from the network in this way. (Node operators can run multiple nodes, and 120 are rarely running simultaneously; at the time of writing, 55 unique IDs operated 103 nodes.)

By February 27, some node operators were prepared to leave the network altogether. “It’s personally getting beyond my risk tolerance,” wrote @Runetard in the dev Discord. “Sorry to those of the community that feel otherwise. There are a bunch of us holding all the risk and some are getting ready to walk away.”

Even so, the financial incentive for the network operators who remained was significant. As one member of the dev Discord put it earlier that day, $3 million had been “extracted as commission” from the theft by those operating THORChain. “This is wrong!” they wrote.

Thorbjornsen weighed in on this back-and-forth, during which nodes paused and unpaused the network. He now says there was a right and wrong way for node operators to have behaved. “The correct way of doing things,” he says, was for node operators who opposed processing stolen funds to “go offline and … get [themselves] kicked out” rather than try to police who could use THORChain. He also says that while operators could discuss stopping transactions, “there was simply no design in the code that allowed [them] to do that.” However, a since-deleted post from his personal X account on March 3, 2025, stated: “I pushed for all my nodes to unhalt trading [keep trading]. Threatened to yank bond if they didn’t comply. Every single one.” (Thorbjornsen says his social media team ran this account in 2025.)

In an Australian 7 News Spotlight documentary last June, Thorbjornsen estimated that THORChain earned between $5 million and $10 million from the heist.

When asked in that same documentary if he received any of those fees, he replied, “Not directly.” When we spoke, I asked him to elaborate. He said he’s “not a recipient” of any funds THORChain sets aside for developers or marketers, nor does he operate any nodes. He was merely speaking generally, he told me: “All crypto holders profit indirectly off economic activity on any chain.”

Most important to Thorbjornsen was that, despite “huge pressure to shut the protocol down and stop servicing these swaps,” THORChain chugged along. He also notes that the hackers’ tactics, moving fast and splitting funds across multiple addresses, made it difficult to identify “bad swaps.”

Blockchain experts like Nick Carlsen, a former FBI analyst at the blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs, don’t buy this assessment. Other services similar to THORChain were identifying and rejecting these transactions. Had THORChain done the same, Carlsen adds, the stolen funds could have been contained on the Ethereum network, which “would have basically denied North Korea the ability to kick off this laundering process.”

And while THORChain touts its decentralization, in “practical applications” like the Lazarus Group’s theft, “most de-fi [decentralized finance] protocols are centralized,” says Daren Firestone, an attorney who represents crypto industry whistleblowers, citing a 2023 US Treasury Department risk assessment on illicit finance.

With centralization comes culpability, and in these cases, Firestone adds, that comes down to “who profits from [the protocol], so who creates it? But most importantly, who controls it?” Is there someone who can “hit an emergency off switch? … Direct nodes?”

Many answer these questions with Thorbjornsen’s name. “Everyone likes to pass the blame,” he says, even though he wasn’t alone in building THORChain. “​​In the end, it all comes back to me anyway.”

According to Thorbjornsen, his story goes like this.

The third of 10 homeschooled children in a “traditional” Catholic household in rural Australia, he spent his days learning math, reading, writing, and studying the Bible. As he got older, he was also responsible for instructing his younger siblings. Wednesday was his day to move the solar panels that powered their home. His parents “installed” a mango and citrus orchard, more to keep nine boys busy than to reap the produce, he says.

“We lived close to a local airfield,” Thorbjornsen says, “and I was always mesmerized by these planes.” He joined the Australian air force and studied engineering, but he says the military left him feeling like “a square peg in a round hole.” He adds that doing things his own way got him frequently “pulled aside” by superiors.

“That’s when I started looking elsewhere,” he says, and in 2013, he found bitcoin. It appealed because it existed “outside the system.”

During the 2017 crypto bull run, Thorbjornsen raised AU$12 million in an initial coin offering for CanYa, a decentralized marketplace he cofounded. CanYa ultimately “died” in 2018, and Thorbjornsen pivoted to a “decentralized liquidity” project that would become THORChain.

He worked with a couple of different developer teams, and then, in 2019, he clicked with an American developer, Chad Barraford, at a hackathon in Germany. Barraford (who declined to be interviewed for this story) was an early public face of THORChain.

Around this time, Thorbjornsen says, “a couple of us helped manage the payroll and early investment funds.” In a 2020 interview, Kai Ansaari, identified as a THORChain “project lead,” wrote, “We’re all contributors … There’s no real ‘lead,’ ‘CEO,’ ‘founder,’ etc.”

In interviews conducted since he came out from behind the “leena” account in 2024, Thorbjornsen has positioned himself as a key lead. He now says his plan had always been to hand over the account, along with command powers and control of THORChain social media accounts, once the blockchain had matured enough to realize its promise of decentralization.

In 2021, he says, he started this process, first by ceasing to use his own rune to back node operators who didn’t have enough to supply their own funding (this can be a way to influence node votes without operating a node yourself). That year, the protocol suffered multiple hacks that resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Nine Realms, a US-incorporated coding company, was brought on to take over THORChain’s development. Thorbjornsen says he passed “leena” over to “other community members” and “left crypto” in 2021, selling “a bunch of bitcoin” and buying the helicopter.

Despite this crypto departure, he came back onto the scene with gusto in 2024 when he revealed himself as the operator of the “leena” account. “​​For many years, I stayed private because I didn’t want the attention,” he says now.

By early 2024 Thorbjornsen considered the network to be sufficiently decentralized and began advertising it publicly. He started regularly posting videos on his TikTok and YouTube channels (“Two sick videos every week,” in the words of one caption) that showed him piloting his helicopter wearing shirts that read “Thor.”

By November 2024, Thorbjornsen, who describes himself as “a bit flamboyant,” was calling himself THORChain’s CEO (“chief energy officer”) and the “master of the memes” in a video from Binance Blockchain Week, an industry conference in Dubai. You need “strong memetic energy,” he says in the video, “to create the community, to create the cult.” Cults imply centralized leadership, and since outing himself as “leena,” Thorbjornsen has publicly appeared to helm the project, with one interviewer deeming him the “THORChain Satoshi” (an allusion to the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin).

One consequence of going public as a face of the protocol: He’s received death threats. “I stirred it up. Do I regret it? Who knows?” he said when we met in Australia. “It’s caused a lot of chaos.”

But, he added, “this is the bed that I’ve laid.” When we spoke again, months later, he backtracked, saying he “got sucked into” defending THORChain in 2024 and 2025 because he was involved from 2018 to 2021 and has “a perspective on how the protocol operates.”

Ryan Treat, a retired US Army veteran, woke up one morning in January 2025 to some disturbing activity on X. “My heart sank,” he says. THORFi, the THORChain program he’d used to earn interest on the bitcoin he’d planned to save for his retirement, had frozen all accounts—but that didn’t make sense.

THORFi featured a lending and saving program said to give users “complete control” and self-custody of their crypto, meaning they could withdraw it at any time.

Treat was no crypto amateur. He bought his first bitcoin at around “$5 apiece,” he says, and had always kept it off centralized exchanges that would maintain custody of his wallets. He liked THORChain because it claimed to be decentralized and permissionless. “I got into bitcoin because I wanted to have government-less money,” he says.

We were told it was decentralized. Then you wake up one morning and read this guy had an admin mimir.

Many who’d used THORFi lending and saving programs felt similarly. Users I interviewed differentiated THORChain from centralized lending platforms like BlockFi and Celsius, both of which offered extraordinarily high yields before filing for bankruptcy in 2022. “I viewed THORChain as a decentralized system where it was safer,” says Halsey Richartz, a Florida-based THORFi creditor, with “vanilla, 1% passive yield.” Indeed, users I spoke with hadn’t felt the need to monitor their THORFi deposits. “Only your key can be used to withdraw your funds,” the product’s marketing materials insisted. “Savers can withdraw their position to native assets at any time.”

So on January 9, when the “leena” account announced that an admin key had been used to pause withdrawals, it took THORFi users by surprise—and seemed to contradict the marketing messaging around decentralization. “We were told that it was decentralized, and you wake up one morning and read an article that says ‘This guy, JP, had an admin mimir,’” says Treat, referring to Thorbjornsen, “and I’m like, ‘What the fuck is an admin mimir?’”

The admin mimir was one of “a bunch of hard-coded admin keys built into the base code of the system,” says Jonathan Reiter, CEO of the blockchain intelligence company ChainArgos. Those with access to the keys had the ability to make executive decisions on the blockchain—a function many THORChain users didn’t realize could supersede the more democratic decisions made by node votes. These keys had been in THORChain’s code for years and “let you control just about anything,” Reiter adds, including the decision to pause the network during the hacks in 2021 that resulted in a loss of more than $16 million in assets.

Thorbjornsen says that one key was given to Nine Realms, while another was “shared around the original team.” He told me at least three people had them, adding, “I can neither confirm nor deny having access to that mimir key, because there’s no on-chain registry of the keys.”

Regardless of who had access, Thorbjornsen maintains that the admin mimir mechanism was “widely known within the community, and heavily used throughout THORChain’s history” and that any action taken using the keys “could be largely overruled by the nodes.” Indeed, nodes voted to open withdrawals back up shortly after the admin key was used to pause them. By then, those burned by THORFi argue, the damage had already been done. The executive pause to withdrawals, for some, signaled that something was amiss with THORFi. This led to a bank run after the pause was lifted, until the nodes voted to freeze withdrawals permanently (which Thorbjornsen had suggested in a since-deleted post on X), separating users from crypto worth around $200 million in US dollars on January 23. THORFi users were then offered a token called TCY (THORChain Yield), which they could claim with the idea that, when its price rose to $1, they would be made whole. (The price, as of writing, sits at $0.16.)

Who used the key? Thorbjornsen maintains he didn’t do it, but he claims he knows who did and won’t say. He says he’d handed over the “leena” account and doesn’t “have access to any of the core components of the system,” nor has he for “at least three years.” He implies that whoever controlled “leena” at the time used the admin key to pause network withdrawals.

A video released by Nine Realms on February 20, 2025, names Thorbjornsen as the activator of the key, stating, “JP ended up pausing lenders and savers, preventing withdrawals so that we can work out … [a] payback plan on them.” Thorbjornsen told me the video was “not factual.”

Multiple blockchain analysts told me it would be extremely difficult to determine who used the admin mimir key. A month after it was used to pause the network, THORChain said the key had been “removed from the network.” At least you can’t find the words “admin mimir” in THORChain’s base code; I’ve looked.

After the debacle of the THORFi withdrawal freeze, Richartz says, he tried to file reports with the Miami-Dade Police Department, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and Interpol. When we spoke in November, he still hadn’t been able to file with the city of Miami. They told him to try small claims court.

“I was like, no, you don’t understand … a post office box in Switzerland is the company address,” he says. “It underscored to me how little law enforcement even knows about these crimes.”

As for the Bybit hack, at least one government has retaliated against those who facilitate blockchain projects. Last April German authorities shut down eXch, an exchange suspected of using THORChain to process funds Lazarus stole from Bybit, says Julia Gottesman, cofounder and head of investigations at the cybersecurity group zeroShadow. Australia, she adds, where Thorbjornsen was based, has been “slow to try to engage with the crypto community, or any regulations.”

In response to requests for comment, Australia’s Department of Home Affairs wrote that at the end of March 2026, the country’s regulatory powers will expand to include “exchanges between the same type of cryptocurrency and transfers between different types.” They did not comment on specific investigations.

Crypto and finance experts disagree about whether THORChain engaged in money laundering, defined by the UN as “the processing of criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin.” But some think it fits the definition.

Shlomit Wagman, a Harvard fellow and former head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering agency and its delegation to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), thinks the Bybit activity was money laundering because THORChain helped the hackers “transfer the funds in an unsupervised manner, completely outside of the scope of regulated or supervised activity.”

And by helping with conversions, Carlsen says, THORChain enabled bad actors to turn stolen crypto into usable currency. “People like [Thorbjornsen] have a personal degree of culpability in sustaining the North Korean government,” he says. Thorbjornsen counters that THORChain is “open-source infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, just days after the hack, Bybit issued a 10% bounty on any funds recovered. As of mid-January this year, between $100 million and $500 million worth of those funds in US dollars remain unaccounted for, according to Gottesman of zeroShadow, which was hired by Bybit to recover funds following the hack.

For Thorbjornsen, it’s just another day at the casino. That’s the comparison he made during his regrettable 7 News Spotlight interview about the Bybit heist, and he repeated it when we met. “You go to a casino, you play a few games, you expect to lose,” he told me. “When you do actually go to zero, don’t cry.”

Thorbjornsen, it should be noted, has lost at the casino himself.

In September, he says, he got a Telegram message from a friend, inviting him to a Zoom meeting. He accepted and participated in a call with people who had “American voices.”

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year, fending off “threat vectors” left and right.

After the meeting, Thorbjornsen learned that his friend’s Telegram had been hacked. Whoever was responsible had used the Zoom link to remotely install software on Thorbjornsen’s computer, which “got access to everything”—his email, his crypto wallets, a bitcoin-based retirement fund. It cost him at least $1.2 million. The blockchain sleuth known as ZachXBT traced the funds and attributed the hack to North Korea.

Ultimately, Thorbjornsen describes himself as a guy who’s had a bad year. He says he had to liquidate his crypto assets because he’s dealing with the fallout of a recent divorce. He also feels he is fending off “threat vectors” left and right. More than once, he asked if I was a private investigator masquerading as a journalist.

Still, his many contradictions don’t inspire confidence. He doesn’t have any more crypto assets, he says. However, the crypto wallet he shared with me so I could pay him back for lunch showed that it contained assets worth more than $143,000 in US dollars. He now says it wasn’t his wallet. He says he doesn’t control THORChain’s social media, but he’d also told me that he runs the @THORChain X account (later backtracking and saying the account is “delegated” to him for trickier questions).

He insists that he does not care about money. He says that in the robot future, the AI-powered hive mind will become our benevolent overlord, rendering money obsolete, so why give it much thought? Yet as we flew back from the vineyard, he pointed out his new house from the helicopter. It resembles a compound. He says he lives there with his new wife.

Multiple people I spoke with about Thorbjornsen before I met him warned me he wasn’t trustworthy, and he’s undeniably made fishy statements. For instance, the presence of a North Korean flag in a row of decals on the tail of his helicopter suggested an affinity with the country for which THORChain has processed so much crypto. Thorbjornsen insists he had requested the flag of Australia’s Norfolk Island, calling the mix-up “a complete coincidence.” The flags were gone by the time of our flight, apparently removed during a recent repair.

“Money is a meme,” he says. “Money does not exist.” Meme or not, it’s had real repercussions for those who have interacted with THORChain, and those who wound up losing have been looking for someone to blame.

When I spoke with Thorbjornsen again in January, he appeared increasingly concerned that he is that someone. He’s spending more time in Singapore, he told me. Singapore happens to have historically denied extraditions to the US for money-laundering prosecutions.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

The quest to find out how our bodies react to extreme temperaturesClimate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Megan: Absolutely. So much exciting innovation clearly going on behind the scenes. Thank you both so much.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <h2>AI FOMO: Where the “I” is not just intelligence, but I, the human</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-fomo-where-the-i-is-not-just-intelligence-but-i-the-human">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.
