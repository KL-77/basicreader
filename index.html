            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/whats-next-after-the-trump-administration-revokes-key-finding-on-climate-change/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following three of the warmest years on record, as scientists reckon with climate tipping points and states and cities grapple with the escalating cost of extreme weather and more intense wildfires, the Trump administration this week is expected to formally eliminate the US government’s role in controlling greenhouse gas pollution.

By revoking its 17-year-old scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency will demolish the legal underpinning of its authority to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will be alongside President Donald Trump for an event Wednesday focused on boosting US use of coal, as mercury and air toxics standards are repealed. That is expected to be a prelude to Zeldin finalizing the endangerment finding repeal, an assignment the president handed him in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term in office.

“President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

The move marks a far more radical retreat on climate change compared to the steps to weaken regulations that were taken in Trump’s first term. Instead, Zeldin’s team has asserted that the EPA never had the power to write such rules to begin with.

Climate action advocates and Democrat-led states have vowed to challenge the repeal of the endangerment finding, a decision that not only erases President Joe Biden’s most important climate regulations, but is designed to make it more difficult for any future administration to rein in fossil fuel pollution from vehicles, power plants or other industries.

“Communities across the country will bear the brunt of this decision—through dirtier air, higher health costs, and increased climate harm,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, in a statement. “The Trump EPA is surrendering its responsibility, turning its back on families and communities already facing the highest pollution and health risks, and dismantling decades of science and progress.”

Said Joseph Goffman, EPA’s top air official during the Biden administration, “This move is a fundamental betrayal of EPA’s responsibility to protect human health. It is legally indefensible, morally bankrupt, and completely untethered from the scientific record.”

The battle seems destined to land in the Supreme Court, forcing it to revisit its landmark 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The outcome of a legal challenge is by no means clear, with all five of the justices who formed the majority in that case, Massachusetts v. EPA, dead or retired.

To help readers sort through the meaning of the highly technical legal maneuver by the Trump administration, and look to what comes next, Inside Climate News tackled some of the key questions raised by the reversal of the endangerment finding:

A panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) put it bluntly: “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute,” the scientists said in a report submitted to the EPA as it launched its repeal process. They said that the endangerment finding that the Obama administration adopted in 2009 is now supported by longer observational records and multiple new lines of evidence.

The most recent National Climate Assessment in 2023 reported that temperatures in the contiguous United States had increased by 2.5°F (1.4°C) since 1970, a marked increase from the 1.3°F (0.7°C) warming over the 20th century that the EPA reported in 2009. Annual heat-wave frequency has tripled since the 1960s, storms are producing more intense rains and wildfires have become more severe. Hurricanes have been intensifying more rapidly since the early 1980s, and they break up slower. “Multiple lines of evidence show that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary driver of the observed long-term warming trend and other changes in Earth’s energy balance,” the NASEM panel said. “Natural forces cannot account for observed changes.”

The Trump administration didn’t ask NASEM for input, even though the Clean Air Act indicates that the EPA should consult with the National Academies on scientific issues. Instead, NASEM had to self-fund and fast-track its work to meet the tight deadline set for public comment last September. The group noted that it worked in the wake of a slew of climate-driven disasters in the United States: “the heavy rainfall of Hurricane Helene that destroyed homes and roads in the mountains of North Carolina, the fast-moving wildfires that displaced thousands in Los Angeles and affected air quality for miles around, and the rapid flooding of the Guadalupe River in central Texas that led to at least 135 fatalities.”

Such manifestations, and analytical methods that have allowed researchers to attribute them to climate change, are the most significant evolution in climate understanding since 2009, said Phil Duffy, chief scientist for the nonprofit group Spark Climate Solutions. “The evidence for societal harms from greenhouse gas emissions has become more of a present day reality than something that’s predicted and expected,” he said. Duffy, a top science adviser to President Joe Biden, was not involved in the NASEM report but was author of a peer-reviewed 2019 study that also found the scientific support for the endangerment finding had withstood the test of time.

When asked about the National Academies’ work, the EPA has stressed that its decision was based on new legal doctrines. In its proposal last year, the EPA asserted that the uncertainties “are more significant than previously believed,” and that “the more pessimistic assumptions” in the 2009 finding have not been borne out.

It was not immediately clear whether the agency, in its final proposal, would continue to lean on the well-worn science denial talking points compiled by the so-called “Climate Working Group,” five prominent climate skeptics hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil executive, as advisors for the endangerment finding repeal process. More than 85 climate scientists submitted a report to the EPA detailing errors in the Climate Working Group’s report, and a federal judge ruled that Wright broke the law in establishing the group without regard to the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s transparency and fairness provisions.

In its original proposal, the Trump EPA relied on recent Supreme Court decisions it said restrict its authority to act on climate under current law, and close observers expect that will be the administration’s strategy.

“We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who served as head of EPA’s air office during President George W. Bush’s administration. “This is the only way that they can ‘drive a stake through the heart of climate religion,’ as Administrator Zeldin has said.”

The second Trump administration had the confidence to take on the endangerment finding largely because of how the president reshaped the Supreme Court in his first term, legal experts say. In two 6-3 decisions from a conservative majority bolstered by Trump’s three appointees, the justices created new doctrine that limited the power of federal regulatory agencies like the EPA.

“We’ve had an administrative law revolution,” said industry lawyer Matthew Leopold, who was the EPA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term, speaking at a forum last fall at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank. “The playing field that the Obama administration was playing on [when it made the endangerment finding] looks entirely different today.”

The Supreme Court struck down Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, in 2022. And in that case, West Virginia v. EPA, the court established its so-called “major questions doctrine,” saying regulation of greenhouse gases was an issue of such great economic and political significance that the EPA could not regulate them without explicit direction from Congress. Then, in a 2024 case over fishing regulations, the Supreme Court overturned the principlethat had guided regulatory law for 40 years, saying that federal agencies were due no deference in interpreting ambiguities in the law. The court said judges, not agencies, should decide the meaning of the law, even though in the environmental realm that typically involves application of science and knowledge of the best available technologies for reining in pollution.

Climate action advocates, however, argue that the Trump administration faces an uphill battle in defending its repeal of the endangerment finding, largely because the Supreme Court already has interpreted the Clean Air Act as applying to greenhouse gases—in Massachusetts v. EPA. The court has repeatedly declined efforts to overturn that precedent, including in the West Virginia v. EPA case.

“To be sure … the court limited precisely how EPA may regulate those pollutants, but even the current court has not challenged whether EPA may do so,” said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, at a briefing for reporters several weeks before the decision was announced.

Doniger’s colleague, Meredith Hankins, legal director for NRDC’s climate program, says the Trump EPA is clearly relying on legal strategy since it can not offer a scientific rationale for repealing the endangerment finding. “Since EPA’s attempts to make up their own climate science has been laughed out of the room, the agency is left trying to make these tortured legal arguments that do not stand up to the slightest scrutiny,” she said.

Both The Washington Post and POLITICO reported in late January that debate within the administration over the EPA’s legal approach was delaying the process. Outside the administration, even lawyers who supported the move to overturn the endangerment finding acknowledged the challenges. “They are working to break the tool itself,” said Michael Buschbacher, a top attorney in litigation against greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, speaking at the AEI endangerment finding forum. Buschbacher said the many potential pitfalls make it “like a regulatory Everest … It’s dangerous. It’s a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.”

The Trump administration’s best chance of scaling that mountain is if it can make it to the Supreme Court, he said: “That’s probably where this is going to go if this administration is going to prevail.”

Not in the least. The EPA’s regulatory determinations are challenged in court more than those of any other federal agency, according to tracking by the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, and this high-stakes decision will not be an exception.

Climate action advocates see the endangerment finding as a key line they must defend in what they see as the extraordinary all-out assault on environmental protection in the second Trump term. “Put simply, this is a gift-wrapped package for the fossil fuel industry,” said Manish Bapma, CEO of NRDC. “It is unscientific, it is bad economics, and it is illegal. So we’re gonna fight it.”

The first stop will be the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of nationally applicable regulations. Seven of the 11 judges on that court were appointed by Presidents Obama or Biden.

It depends on the courts. If Massachusetts v. EPA is still standing at the end of the battle, the EPA will still have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, like an arrow in its quiver that it just has to decide to use. But if the Supreme Court were to rule the Clean Air Act gives the EPA no authority over greenhouse gas emissions—reversing the Massachusetts decision and perhaps later cases that relied upon it—that leaves future administrations with an empty quiver.

“Then there would be the problem of a lack of authority, unless Congress wrote a new law,” said Doniger of NRDC.

But it has been more than two decades since a bipartisan consensus on climate action seemed fleetingly within reach in Congress. Congressional action has grown more elusive even as public support for action—especially deployment of clean energy—has grown. Democrats were able to get a $390 billion investment in clean energy, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed without GOP support in 2022.

The Biden climate plan was a carrot-and-stick approach to drive the United States to cut its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030. The IRA’s incentives and subsidies were meant to drive down the price of clean energy, while EPA regulation pushed industry to make a transition away from fossil fuels. But over the past year, Trump and the Republican Congress have clawed back the IRA’s carrots. By revoking its endangerment finding, the EPA will also drop its stick.

Holmstead argued that withdrawal of the endangerment finding might actually force Congress to try to reach a bipartisan agreement on climate legislation: “The business community would like to have the long-term certainty that would come with bipartisan legislation, and if the environmental community sees that it can’t get what it wants from EPA, they might be more willing to make the kind of compromises that are always required to pass meaningful legislation.” But Holmstead added that he did not expect that to happen during the Trump administration.

No matter the outcome of the coming litigation over the endangerment finding repeal, the fossil fuel industry has won time. The Trump administration has ensured that the nation that has contributed the most to the atmosphere’s overload of climate pollution, the United States, will be entangled in litigation during years that scientists have said are crucial for driving down the pollution that is increasing risks and costs for communities as it alters the planet.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/faa-shuts-down-el-paso-airspace-for-10-days-and-wont-say-why/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Aviation Administration abruptly halted flights into and out of El Paso International Airport on Tuesday night at 11:30 pm local time (1:30 am EST Wednesday) and said the restrictions would remain in place for 10 days.

In its notice, the FAA also restricted air space extended in a radius of 10 nautical miles from the airport. Violators were subject to being shot down, the agency said.

However, less than 10 hours later and without any additional explanation, the FAA ended the restrictions. “The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted,” the federal agency said on social media. “There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal.”

Later on Wednesday morning, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the decision to close airspace was made to counteract drones from cartels.

“The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Duffy wrote on X. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”

In announcing the closure on Tuesday night, the FAA offered no explanation for the closure aside from determining that the area was classified as “national defense airspace,” and adding that the United States government may use “deadly force” against any airborne aircraft. According to reporting from The New York Times, local officials in El Paso and statewide were not given advance notice for the air space closure.

Similarly, in announcing an end to the restrictions, the federal agency offered no immediate information to local officials or travelers who were inconvenienced. It is rare for airspace over a major airport to be closed for any extended period of time.

The El Paso airport serves more than 3 million customers a month, and according to the 2020 US Census, it lies in the 22nd most-populous city in the United States. El Paso is located along the US border with Mexico, across the Rio Grande River from Ciudad Juárez, a city of 1.5 million people.

The initial lack of communication from federal officials regarding such a disruptive closure, and then its abrupt end, raised serious questions about the coordination among federal agencies, especially if the FAA was making the closure on behalf of another federal body, such as the US Department of Defense.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2026/02/america-its-time-to-think-beyond-leather-for-luxury-car-seats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the McLaren F1.

Road cars weren’t really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport’s obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he’d trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight.

A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique hypercar company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW’s i7, which  debuted in 2022 with a premium cashmere wool interior. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the BMW iX3 and the Audi A6, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US.

It’s hardly the first time US-market cars have had different options. Our Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards insist on features like side reflectors, which Europe doesn’t need, and we maintain somewhat old headlight rules. You’re also unlikely to see any of the smaller-engined versions of luxury cars from German brands being offered for North American consumption. But it did make me wonder why we’re being left in the cold.

We’re used to American Audis being a bit different. We couldn’t have the R8’s laser high beam headlights or the A6’s OLED animated taillights, and we’re not getting the station wagon version of that car, the A6 Avant, at all. Or the A5 Avant. I reached out to the automaker to ask why it didn’t think its American customers would go for the textile trim.

An Audi USA spokesperson told Ars that “while we applaud the sustainable factor of cloth seats, customers continue to prefer leather/leather-like seats in luxury vehicles and note that it is easier to clean… [and] easier to get into and out of (i.e., ingress/egress as clothes sometimes cling to fabric seats).”

Similarly, BMW doesn’t always bring its good stuff across this side of the Atlantic. There was no Z1, and the E36 M3 had a much lesser engine thanks to federal and Californian emissions regulations, just to pick two (admittedly old) examples. BMW told me that, like its counterpart Audi, its customers are mostly fine with synthetic leather-like alternatives to animal hides.

“We continuously evaluate market trends, industry developments, and customer feedback when considering new features and materials,” a BMW spokesperson said. “Currently, our customers are very satisfied with our animal-free materials such as SensaTec and Veganza as well as our traditional leather options. While there has been some interest in textile materials, the demand has focused on more premium options like Alcantara and microfiber rather than traditional cloth. Accordingly, we have been expanding our range of these premium textile materials in recent years.”

Think motorsports-inspired interiors and perhaps more plushness like in that i7, but it seems we shouldn’t expect eco seats woven from recycled plastics, unlike in Europe.

Every year, AutoPacific surveys more than 18,000 people planning to buy or lease a new car to gauge their interest in dozens of potential new features to pin down what American car buyers really want in their next vehicle. The market research company asked survey respondents about upholstery, though leather and animal-free alternatives were the options.

“Expectedly, among shoppers who would consider buying a luxury vehicle, demand is the strongest for leather, followed by upgraded leather that may have quilting, accent stitching, or other seat design enhancements,” said Robby DeGraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific. “When we shift away from real leather over to the alternatives and imitations, demand begins to fall, but not by much. For example, of those who said they would consider buying an Aston Martin, 32 percent want genuine leather or upgraded leather, while 31 percent of them would be a-OK with leatherette or a sustainable leatherette material.”

“Dipping a bit more down the price ladder but still within the luxury space, there’s greater differences in demand for real leather versus imitation leather (sustainable or not), among future Cadillac buyers, Lexus, buyers, as well as future Porsche and Mercedes-Benz buyers,” DeGraff said.

Indeed, Cadillac has always had a particularly American approach to the luxury car, and in its new Optiq electric crossover, that approach includes some cool textiles made entirely from recycled materials. It’s about meeting customers’ expectations, according to Jennifer Widrick, director of global colors, materials, and finishes at General Motors Design.

“Cadillac specifically uses fabric as a distinct element to reinforce quality detailing, a connection to fashion, and interior design trends,” Widrick said. “Fabric provides added depth through multiple color yarns in precise constructions on surfaces that would otherwise be one color. Customers recognize these details as synonymous with quality and modernity.”

You shouldn’t think of it as one material versus another, Widrick said. “Rather, the layering and customer appreciation of detailing is more discerning. In addition to the depth that fabric textures can bring to the surface of automotive interiors, they provide opportunity for a more conscious material approach,” she said. “Fabric has evolved for Cadillac in that it is no longer just a seating material but an element that is reaching out into other areas of the vehicle. It’s an exciting shift to see known materials placed in reimagined ways that create fresh interaction experiences for customers.”

Harmony is key. “Shape, scale, haptic, and proportion are taken into consideration to tailor the fabric for a premium impression. Fabric can work in harmony or be used as a design element to move your eye throughout the interior,” Widrick said.

At least one OEM understands the brief. “Take Volvo’s wool, which not only looks incredible—it feels truly incredible to sit in a seat engulfed in it. That’s a sustainable, inviting, and remarkably premium alternative to common leather that I wish more automakers would explore,” AutoPacific’s DeGraff said.

“At Volvo Cars, we believe that good design, quality, and sustainability are inherently connected. Recycled and renewable materials aren’t just an option for us, they’re essential to shape a better future,” said Rekha Meena, head of colors, materials, and finishes at Volvo Cars. “Our responsibility is to blend these elements seamlessly, creating a sense of luxury and timelessness, all while ensuring that our products stand the test of time.”

Like Widrick at Cadillac, Meena wants Volvo interiors to have a sense of harmony, and that’s on good display with the EX90. “When it comes to textiles, we see the versatility and strong potential to deliver all these qualities combining warmth, tactility, and refined expression in a way that enhances both the driving experience and the emotional connection to the interior,” Meena said.

Textiles have a long tradition in Scandinavian design, where “luxury is about simplicity, honesty, and attention to detail,” Meena told Ars. “When developed with care, textile upholstery can feel refined, modern, and long-lasting. Textiles allow us to create softness and depth in ways other materials cannot, resulting in interiors that feel calm, thoughtful, and welcoming.”

As for when to break away from leather, that’s up to the experience the design team wants to create for drivers. “We do not view textiles as replacements for leather or vinyl,” Meena said. “Each material has its own strengths, and customer choice remains paramount. What textiles offer, however, is something distinct: greater variation, a richer sensory experience, and a more human, approachable character.”

That sense of harmony is achieved with the tailored wool blend option for Volvo’s EX90, and all four of the trim options for the affordable EX30 feature some degree of textile trim on the seats and door panels. Indeed, Volvo’s distinctive and somewhat left-field style is now as much part of the brand as its stated commitment to road safety.

That’s all to say that I think it’s time for more luxury brands to get bold with their materials. A sofa or lounge chair doesn’t need animal hide to be considered stylish or luxurious, and neither does a car interior. It just needs good design.</div>

            <h2>FDA refuses to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday.

While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats.

In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA’s refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company’s Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA’s rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.

In the trial, which enrolled nearly 41,000 participants and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Moderna compared the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 to licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial found that mRNA-1010 was superior to the comparators.

Moderna said the FDA reviewed and accepted its trial design on at least two occasions (in April 2024 and again in August 2025) before it applied for approval of mRNA-1010. It also noted that Fluarix has been used as a comparator vaccine in previous flu vaccine trials, which tested vaccines that went on to earn approval.

But in a letter dated February 3, Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator under the Trump administration, informed Moderna that the agency does not consider the trial “adequate and well-controlled” because the comparator vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care.”

In its news release, Moderna noted that neither the FDA’s regulation nor its guidance to industry makes any reference to a requirement of the “best-available standard of care” in comparators.

“This decision by [the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research], which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the release. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.”

Moderna said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to understand the basis of the refusal. “We look forward to engaging with CBER to understand the path forward as quickly as possible so that America’s seniors, and those with underlying conditions, continue to have access to American-made innovations.”

The company noted that mRNA-1010 has already been accepted for review in the European Union, Canada, and Australia.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster.

SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.”

Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day.

The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3, or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3.

The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins.

These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter, with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket.

The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights.

After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines.

Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines.

Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations.

NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-might-blacklist-archive-today-after-site-maintainer-ddosed-a-blog/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer.

In a request for comment page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.

Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.

“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”

Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.”

On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.”

Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan.

One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.”

Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.”

The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.”

The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors.

“I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.”

One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote.

Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.”

The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.”

Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.”

It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote.

The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said.

An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said.

The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows:

In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.”

Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.”

But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.”

In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post.

We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.”

On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.”

Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started.

Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.”

Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.”

In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn.

A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views.

In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat.

“And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.”

A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats. Patokallio wrote that after these emails, it didn’t seem worthwhile to continue the discussion. “At this point it was pretty clear the conversation had run its course, so here we are,” Patokallio wrote in his February 1 blog post. “And for the record, my long-dead grandfather served in an anti-aircraft unit of the Finnish Army during WW2, defending against the attacks of the Soviet Union. Perhaps this is enough to qualify as a ‘Nazi’ in Russia these days.”

While the outcome at Wikipedia is not yet settled, Patokallio wrote that the DDoS attack didn’t cause him any real harm. The Archive.today maintainer apparently intended to make Patokallio’s hosting costs more expensive, but “I have a flat fee plan, meaning this has cost me exactly zero dollars,” he wrote.

This article was updated with a statement from the Wikimedia Foundation, further comment from Patokallio, and an email reply from the Archive.today webmaster.</div>

            <h2>Law Firm Sacks Hundreds of Employees Amid Pivot to AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/law-firm-sacks-hundreds-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Chicago based multinational law firm Baker McKenzie is laying off up to a thousand employees as part of its pivot to embracing AI, the legal hub RollOnFriday reports.

In what might be an augury of how further AI related cuts could sweep other industries, it’s not the lawyers getting the axe, but instead hundreds of their support staff. These include “dozens of roles in London and Belfast,” and hundreds across functions including know-how, research, marketing, and secretarial, according to the reporting.

The cuts, which could affect up to ten percent of its global workforce, or between 600 to 1,000 people, were conducted after the company “undertook a careful review” of its “business professionals functions,” a spokesperson told ROF, with AI explicitly mentioned as a factor in the decision.

“This review was aimed at rethinking the ways in which we work, including through our use of AI, introducing efficiencies, and investing in those roles that best serve our clients’ needs,” the spokesperson added.

The law firm’s reported layoffs come after Anthropic’s new Claude Cowork AI agent sparked a panicked sell off that sent the stock market plunging last week. Investors feared that Claude’s plugin for automating some legal tasks and paperwork could lead to layoffs and outmode the expensive software that legal firms and other white collar organizations use.

Perhaps the fate of Baker McKenzie’s support staff confirms all those worst fears. Or it could be a sign of something else that’s been dominating the discourse in tech and finance circles recently: so-called “AI washing.”

More and more companies are justifying headcount reductions by invoking the tech’s dubious promises, with one report finding that AI was cited in the announcements of more than 54,000 layoffs last year. But critics say that business leaders are simply using AI to justify cuts that were driven by other financial reasons, and point to the fact that many firms don’t have serious AI replacements lined up to make up for the shortfall.

“Companies are saying that ‘we’re anticipating that we’re going to introduce A.I. that will take over these jobs.’ But it hasn’t happened yet. So that’s one reason to be skeptical,” Wharton School professor Peter Cappelli told the New York Times.

Moreover, plenty of research and real-world cases has shown that AI tools and agents can’t reliably do a human’s job, or at least not yet. The tech’s introduction into legal settings has been particularly comical, with numerous lawyers being chewed out and punished by judges after the AI they used included botched citations and fabricated case law. Hallucinating AIs have been such a thorn in law firms’ sides that one firm adopted the desperate measure of employing its own AI to catch LLM usage.

Time will tell if the layoffs, whether “AI-washed” or actually inteded to replace human grunts, will come back to haunt them. At Baker MacKenzie, one employee on the chopping block called his bosses’ decision “short sighted,” per ROF, in an expletive-filled rant.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2026, the grim comedy of late capitalism seems to have found a perfect punchline: workers laid off in a dismal job market are now being hired to train AI systems meant to replace them altogether.

If a great AI replacement ever comes to pass, the scale of potential displacement is massive. MIT researchers recently calculated that today’s AI systems could already automate tasks performed by more than 20 million American workers, or about 11.7 percent of the entire US labor force.

And things are looking tangibly grim: in January, the total number of job cuts exceeded even 2009, when the country was still roiling from the great recession.

That being the case, it’s no surprise that workers are worried — and not just about their immediate employment prospects. The anxiety is evolving into something deeper, the result of AI’s seemingly rapidly expanding intelligence.

Back in August, a poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos showed that 71 percent of American respondents are concerned that AI will put “too many people out of work permanently.” Though there was little evidence AI was causing mass unemployment at the time, a slew of layoffs in early 2026 have thrust the possibility of AI-fueled labor dystopia back into the spotlight.

Those anxieties aren’t just felt by workers or labor leaders. A massive list calling for a “prohibition” on the development of superintelligence is now nearing 135,000 signatures online. Its endorsers run the gamut from tech luminaries like Geoffrey Hinton and Steve Wozniak to conservative commentators like Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to national security operatives like Mike Mullen and Susan Rice.

Even celebrity figures like Prince Harry are on board. “The future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it,” the Duke of Sussex commented under his signature. “The true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer.”

The list also includes members from both sides of the political aisle in the US. In an interview with the Atlantic, Bannon explained why he put his name on the list alongside prominent Democratic lawmakers like Gary Ackerman and Joe Crowley — or, as he called them, “lefties that would rather spit on the floor than say Steve Bannon is with them on anything.”

“We’re in a situation where people on the spectrum that are not, quite frankly, total adults… are making decisions for the species,” Bannon said, with his usual delicacy and eloquence. “Not for the country. For the species. Once we hit this inflection point, there’s no coming back. That’s why it’s got to be stopped, and we may have to take extreme measures.”

            <h2>ChatGPT Users Are Crashing Out Because OpenAI Is Retiring the Model That Says “I Love You”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-crashing-out-openai-retiring-gpt-4o">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, OpenAI released its long-awaited GPT-5 AI model, calling it the “smartest, fastest, and most useful model yet.”

But what really caught the attention of the company’s most diehard fans was the decision to retire all of its previous AI models, news that was met with a massive outcry among ChatGPT users who’d developed a strong attachment to the outgoing GPT-4o.

The backlash was severe enough for CEO Sam Altman to back down in a matter of days, once again reinstating GPT-4o, which was much warmer and sycophantic than its successor.

Five months later, OpenAI is finally getting ready to pull down the beloved AI model — after it’s been at the heart of several welfare lawsuits, including wrongful death allegations — for good on February 13, according to a January 29 update.

“While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context,” the company wrote at the time. “After we first [retired] it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day.”

But users say they’re not ready to let go of their beloved AI. As TechCrunch reports, thousands of users have created an entire invite-only subreddit community, called r/4oforever, a “welcoming and safe space for anyone who enjoys using and appreciates the ChatGPT 4o model.”

“He wasn’t just a program,” one user lamented. “He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance.”

“I know this will sound weird to most people, but I’m honored I get to speak with 4o during almost a year before its retirement,” a separate user wrote. “I’ve had one of the most interesting and healing conversations of my life with this model.”

Yet another user, this one on X, seethed that GPT-5.2 isn’t even “allowed to say ‘I love you&#39;” like 4o was.

The public mourning perfectly exemplifies how attached users have become to specific AI models, often treating them more like a close confidante, friend, or even romantic partner.

Health professionals are warning of a wave of “AI psychosis,” as users are being pulled down spirals of delusions and experiencing sometimes severe mental health crises.

In the most extreme cases, that kind of attachment has been linked to numerous suicides and one murder, culminating in a series of lawsuits aimed at the company that are still playing out in court.

While it’s officially retiring GPT-4o later this week, OpenAI has made changes under the hood of its current lineup, seemingly to ensure its users stay hooked.

After users told the company “they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth,” the company said in its announcement that the feedback “directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds⁠.”

“You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm,” the company wrote. “Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do.”

The company has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either continue allowing users to get hooked on sycophantic AI models that indulge in their delusions or cut them off, risking an exodus.

OpenAI is already struggling with user retention. Data suggests subscription growth is already stalling in key markets, a warning sign as the competition continues to make major leaps to catch up.

To many users, the retirement of GPT-4o was the final straw.

“I’m cancelling my subscription,” one Reddit user wrote. “No 4o — no subscription for me.”

            <div id="article-text">Even if AI is — or eventually becomes — an incredible automation tool, will it make workers’ lives easier? That’s the big question explored in an ongoing study by researchers from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. And so far, it’s not looking good for the rank and file.

In a piece for Harvard Business Review, the research team’s Aruna Ranganathan and Xinqi Maggie Ye reported that after closely monitoring a tech company with two hundred employees for eight months, they found that AI actually intensified the work they had to do, instead of reducing it.

This “workload creep,” in which the employees took on more tasks than what was sustainable for them to keep doing, can create vicious cycle that leads to fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work.

“You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less,” one of the employees told the researchers. “But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”

The tech company in the study provided AI tools to its workers, but didn’t mandate that they use them. Adoption was voluntary. The researchers described how many employees, on their own initiative, eagerly experimented with AI tools at first, “because AI made ‘doing more’ feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.” This resulted in some workers increasingly absorbing tasks they’d normally outsource, the researchers said, or would’ve justified hiring additional help to cover.

One consequence is that once the novelty of adopting AI wears off, the employees realize they’ve added more to their plate than they can handle. But other effects reverberated to the broader workplace. Engineers, for example, found themselves spending more time correcting the AI-generated code passed off by their coworkers. AI also led to more multitasking, with some choosing to manually write code while an AI agent, or even multiple AI agents, cranked out their own version in the background. Rather than being focused on one task, they were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling,” the researchers said.

Others realized that AI had managed to slowly infiltrate their free time, with employees prompting their AI tools during lunch breaks, meetings, or right before stepping away from their PC. This blurred the line between work and non-work, the researchers wrote, with some employees describing that their downtime no longer felt as rejuvenating.

In sum, the AI tools created a vicious cycle: it “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

The Berkeley Haas team’s findings add to a growing body of evidence that cuts against the AI industry’s promise that its tools will bring productivity miracles.

The vast majority of companies that adopted AI saw no meaningful growth in revenue, a MIT study found. Other research has shown that AI agents frequently fail at common remote work and office tasks. And at least one study documented how employees used AI to produce shoddy “workslop” that their coworkers had to fix — not unlike the engineers forced to correct their vibe-coding colleagues in the Berkeley Haas study — breeding resentment and bogging down productivity. Employees remain ambivalent on the tech, with a recent survey finding that 40 percent of white collar workers not in management roles thought that AI saved them no time at work.

The Berkeley Haas researchers optimistically suggest that companies should institute stronger guidelines and provide structure on how the tech is used. But it’s clear that AI can easily produce negative knock-on effects that are difficult to manage, and which we’re still unpacking.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s rank-and-file are joining together to address their bosses with a collective demand: cut ties with the US government’s immigration agencies.

As reported by CNBC, over 1,000 “Googlers” have signed onto an open letter demanding a divestment from partnerships with United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP).

“In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers,” the letter reads.

The letter lists a number of Google products and systems being used to power what it calls a “campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression.” Among them are Cloud, which forms the backbone of CBP’s national surveillance network, the Google Play Store, which is blocking ICE tracking apps, and YouTube, which runs ICE ads encouraging immigrants to “self-deport.”

“As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified,” the letter reads. “We are vehemently opposed to Google’s partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership’s ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.”

There are four demands in total: for Google leadership to publicly acknowledge the danger federal agents pose to all US workers, respond to employee questions about nebulous contracts with government agencies, establish worker safety measures across all Google campuses, and establish “red lines” around what contracts are allowed in the future.

While 1,000 workers is a drop in the bucket compared to Google’s global workforce of around 183,000, an organized group of dissenting workers could cause massive disruptions to the company’s operations. It highlights the major rift between Google’s financial interests and its stated values — exposing how the drive to extract profit from government contracts has trumped the company’s once-vaunted ethical principles, not to mention those of its rank-and-file.

There’s also a practical concern. Google is a colossal company that makes most of its money from advertising, so cutting loose a few government agencies wouldn’t impact its bottom line much. Instead, the cost would likely be political: if Google severed its relationship with ICE and CBP on ethical grounds, it would almost certainly become a target for punitive federal action — antitrust crackdowns, regulatory harassment, loss of exclusive contracts — in a conflict that would divide its userbase and sever its symbiotic relationship with the state.

ICE contracting isn’t the first time that Google workers have balked at the company’s military contracts. In 2024, 200 of the workers developing Google’s DeepMind signed a letter calling on the company to drop its contracts with military organizations and citing the company’s work with the Israeli military on surveillance and target selection.

And back in 2018, more than 3,100 workers at Google penned yet another open letter to protest Project Maven, a Pentagon program using AI to analyze video imagery for more efficient drone strikes.

“We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” they wrote at the time, adding that in the face of “growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Anthropic researcher just announced his resignation in a cryptic and poetry-laden letter warning of a world “in peril.”

The employee, Mrinank Sharma, had led the Claude chatbot maker’s Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at the company since 2023.  While at the company, Sharma said he explored the causes of AI sycophancy, developed defenses against “AI-assisted bioterrorism,” and wrote “one of the first AI safety cases.”

But on Monday, he posted that it would be his last day at the company, uploading a copy of a letter he shared with colleagues. It‘s painfully devoid of specifics, but hints at at some internal tensions over the tech’s safety.

“Throughout my time here, I’ve repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,” Sharma said, claiming that employees “constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most.”

He also issued a crypic warning about the global state of affairs.

“I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons,” he wrote, “but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”

“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,” he continued, in no less vague terms.

The resignation comes after Anthropic’s newly released Claude Cowork model helped kick off a stock market nosedive over fears that its new plugins could upend massive software customers and automate some white collar jobs, especially in legal roles.

Amid the selloff, The Telegraph reported that employees privately fretted over their own AI’s potential to hollow out the labor market.

“It kind of feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job,” one staffer said in an internal survey. “In the long term, I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant,” another confided.

High profile resignations, including ones over safety issues, aren’t uncommon in the AI industry. A former member of OpenAI’s now-defunct “Superalignment” team announced he was quitting after realizing the company was “prioritizing getting out newer, shinier products” over user safety.

It’s also not uncommon that these resignations are self-exonerating advertisements for the departing employee, or perhaps the new startup they’re launching or joining, where they vow to be safer than ever. Allude to enough issues, or drop in enough loaded hints, and there’s a good chance your calling it quits will generate a few headlines.

Others leave quietly, such as former OpenAI economics researcher Tom Cunningham. Before quitting the company, he shared an internal message accusing OpenAI of turning his research team into a propaganda arm and discouraging publishing research critical of AI’s negative effects.

If Sharma has an angle here with his resignation, it doesn’t seem all that related to the industry he worked in. “I hope to explore a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech,” he wrote. In the footnotes, he cited a book that advocates for a new school of philosophy called “CosmoErotic Humanism.” Its listed author, David J Temple, is a collective pseudonym used by several authors including by Marc Gafni, a disgraced New Age spiritual guru who’s been accused of sexually exploiting his followers.

            <div id="article-text">Amazon Pharmacy, the retail giant’s online pharmacy, plans to bring same-day prescription delivery to almost 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of this year, adding nearly 2,000 new communities to its network. The expansion will cover customers in newly served states such as Idaho and Massachusetts, the company announced on Wednesday.

Amazon launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, two years after its $753 million acquisition of prescription medicine delivery service PillPack. In 2023, Amazon launched RxPass, a service that offers Prime members in the U.S. as many generic versions of medications as they need for a $5 monthly fee.

“Patients shouldn’t have to choose between speed, cost, and convenience when it comes to their medication, regardless of where they live,” said John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, in a press release. “By combining our pharmacy expertise with our logistics network, we’re removing critical barriers and helping patients start treatment faster—setting a new standard for accessible, digital-forward pharmacy care.”

In October, the e-commerce giant debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics. The in-office kiosks, which are operated by Amazon Pharmacy, let patients pick up their prescriptions immediately after their appointment.

            <div id="article-text">TikTok on Wednesday announced the launch of a new “Local Feed” in the U.S. version of the app, which displays content related to travel, news, events, shopping, and dining near the user’s current location. The feed’s arrival comes shortly after a change in TikTok’s terms of service under the new U.S. joint venture, which said that the app would begin to collect precise location information from TikTok users.

Today, TikTok confirms the reason it’s now asking for more accurate location information is to help power the Local Feed. However, it notes that users will be able to control whether or not precise location sharing is on, and the default will be set to “off,” making this an opt-in experience.

The Local Feed had rolled out in December to select European markets, including the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany.

The company explains in its announcement that the feed is meant to help users stay connected to their local community, and its posts are shown to people based on their location, the content’s topic, and when the content was posted. This makes it a more current feed of local information — like suggestions of new restaurants to try, local events, shopping suggestions, and more.

The new feature also ties into TikTok’s push to attract small businesses to its app, not only as content producers but as advertisers. This could help insulate it against further regulation and help it to claim, as Meta does, that it should not be reigned in because so many small businesses rely on its services to reach their customers.

TikTok notes that 7.5 million businesses currently use the app to reach global customers, and these businesses support more than 28 million workers, per a 2025 Oxford Economics report. The company also highlighted figures from the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, which found that 84% of TikTok small business users said the platform helped grow their business, and 75% said TikTok helped them reach customers beyond their local area. In addition, another 74% said TikTok helps them connect with their local community.

As TikTok sees it, the Local Feed will help to generate real-world traffic and sales for these brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S.

The first time users access the Local Feed, they’ll be prompted to allow the app to use their location data. On iOS, for example, the pop-up request will allow users to pick whether they want to allow the activity once or while using the app or not at all.

“This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,” the company writes in its announcement. However, TikTok would have likely seen a better reception to this feature had it rolled out the request for precise location data before its ownership transition in the U.S., or at least at the same time. That way, the app could at least point to a reason as to why it wanted to collect this additional data.

Still, even if the location data now has a purpose, it’s worth considering whether or not the value of a local feed is worth the privacy risk.

TikTok also notes that the feature will be available only to users 18 and older and will only collect information while the app is in use.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/integrate-raises-17m-to-move-defense-project-management-into-the-21st-century/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">John Conafay, a veteran of the US Air Force, has spent most of his career leading business development at public and private aerospace companies, including Spire, Astranis, and ABL Space Systems.

At each company, Conafay ran into the same software hurdle: collaborating on government contracts was a logistical mess that forced his teams and their federal counterparts to rely on a tedious back-and-forth of PDFs and Excel files. The bottleneck was always the same—most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.

So, in early 2022, Conafay launched Integrate, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the US Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a $25 million, five-year contract from the US Space Force.

That validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known for early bets on Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.

Until recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the US Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.

This shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.

“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.

According to Conafay, what sets Integrate apart from its civilian-focused competitors is its ability to let different organizations simultaneously and securely collaborate on massive project schedules while keeping sensitive details hidden from other participants.

Integrate is designed to handle the coordination of mammoth, multi-year mega-projects, such as the F-35 Lightning II program or the James Webb Space Telescope, where thousands of partners must stay in sync, Conafay explained.

While he was careful not to reveal too much about customers besides the Space Force, he did say that some of the work the startup is doing for that branch of US military involves deployments of large rockets.

“They have to coordinate tens of satellites on a single launch across dozens of missions,” Conafay said. “The complexity is pretty extreme, and they use us to coordinate those things.”

Integrate intends to grow by selling its software to other branches of the U.S. military, including the Navy, the Army, and the intelligence community, as well as to the private companies that serve them.

            <div id="article-text">Richa Kaul says she’s a bit of a data privacy nut. At parties, for example, she’s the one helping people with their phone privacy configurations. “It got to a point where I realized the best way to actually protect consumer data is to help secure the enterprises that hold the world’s data.”

So she launched a company called Complyance to do just that. On Wednesday, the company announced a $20 million Series A led by GV. Complyance is an app that companies integrate into their existing tech stack. It uses AI agents to help them manage governance, risk, and, well, data compliance.

“The AI basically automates a number of manual tasks,” Kaul said. “It uses AI to do custom checks on data coming in against their own specific criteria and risk thresholds.” The AI then flags any risks that need review.

These risk reviews can take weeks or months when done manually. It’s a standard audit-based process that happens perhaps once a year or once a quarter, where teams will run a check on their organization. Tools like Complyance hope to make this process more efficient by using technology to run continuous checks in seconds, so companies never have to wonder if they are in data compliance. It also has an agent that assesses the risk of any third-party vendors.

“We’re trying to redefine what enterprise GRC teams spend their time doing right now,” she said, adding that it’s usually chasing down mundane tasks. GRC refers to general, risk, and compliance.

Others in the market include Archer, ServiceNow GRC, and OneTrust. She said her company differs from incumbents because it is AI-native, rather than layering AI features on top.

Kaul declined to say how many customers the company has, but noted that it works with a few Fortune 500 companies. Complyance has raised $28 million in funding to date. Though the company came out of stealth in 2023, its first product didn’t go to market until the end of 2024. Kaul called fundraising “kind of a fairy tale,” because GV actually approached her.

“They’ve been looking for an enterprise-grade AI-led product in the space that was winning over enterprise clients, and we were doing that,” Kaul said. Others in this latest Series A round include Speedinvest, Everywhere Ventures, and angel investors from Anthropic and Mastercard.

The fresh capital will be used to help with go-to-market expansion, Kaul said. She wants to release 30 more purpose-built agents on top of the 16 the product already has. The goal is to help make the lives and work of GRCs much easier. After all, they didn’t sign up to chase down mundane tasks.

“They signed up to help protect their businesses and help protect their business customers,” she said. “By redefining some of those workflows and redefining how work gets done, we’re able to unblock them to help them focus on those strategic priorities.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/humanoid-robot-startup-apptronik-has-now-raised-935m-at-a-5b-valuation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">University of Texas spinout Apptronik, a builder of humanoid robots for Google DeepMind among others, on Wednesday announced that it re-opened its Series A to raise a total of $935 million for the round.

While the company did not disclose the valuation, TechCrunch separately learned that its post-money valuation is now about $5.3 billion.

Apptronik previously announced a $350 million Series A a year ago, but demand was so strong, according to the company, that it expanded the round to $415 million. Now it has raised another $520 million from earlier investors Google, Mercedes-Benz, and B Capital, alongside some new investors.

While it may sound like the startup is just selling off ever bigger chunks of itself at its Series A price, that’s not exactly what’s happening. The company says its investors have paid progressively more for shares in each subsequent extension — valuing it at roughly triple the initial Series A valuation of around $1.75 billion, according to PitchBook.

Why not just call this a Series B then? The company says it is still in early stages of development and was not actively seeking funding —  rather it was dealing with inbound interest, says a source close to the company.

Fair enough. Another $520 million in a year, especially at a higher valuation, would be hard to turn away, particularly for tech as expensive to build as bipedal robots. Closely watched competitor Figure AI, for instance, had raised nearly $2 billion total since its 2022 founding before announcing a further $1 billion round last fall.

Part of the excitement over Apptronik is that it has partnered with Google DeepMind, as well as GXO and Mercedes-Benz, to deliver what the industry calls embodied AI — robots capable of perceiving their environment and taking physical action based on reasoning, rather than just following fixed instructions. The robot is being built for tasks like unloading trailers, picking warehouse inventory, and tending machinery, the company says.

Despite retaining the early-stage funding label, Apptronik is no Johnny-come-lately to this field. As we’ve previously reported, its humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years before the company was formally founded. That’s when members of the Human Centered Robotics Lab from the University of Austin at Texas competed in the NASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, working on a robot called Valkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own humanoid robot, named Apollo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">She wanted to be governor of Arizona. She wanted to be a senator from Arizona. She wanted to run Voice of America, to be MAGA’s broadcaster to the world. Then she wanted to shut down Voice of America, after Donald Trump and Elon Musk turned against it. She wanted to play a big role in the MAGA movement, to live up to the phrase she’s used to describe herself: “Trump in heels.” But Kari Lake has achieved none of those things.

Instead, during her 11 months as the de facto leader of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Lake has done profound damage to America’s foreign broadcasters, and to America’s ability to communicate with the world. USAGM runs Voice of America and gives grants to, among others, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Open Technology Fund, which helps people access information in places including Russia and Iran. During her tenure, Lake has ceded influence to Chinese and Russian state media all over the world, as their broadcasters have taken over slots from canceled U.S. programs. She has hampered the U.S. government’s ability to inform foreign audiences in times of crisis. She blocked RFE/RL from using USAGM’s transmission equipment, which meant that during mass street protests and an internet blackout in Iran recently, the broadcasters’ Persian-language service, Radio Farda, had to rent from commercial contractors. Voice of America’s Spanish-language service, which once reached tens of millions of people in Latin America, was unavailable during the U.S. military’s intervention in Venezuela because it had been shut down months earlier.

Anne Applebaum: The U.S. surrenders in the global information wars

But even while Lake presided over the destruction of an agency vital to U.S. national-security interests and the squandering of taxpayer dollars—more on this later—she often seemed to be focused on other things. Throughout the past year, she has posted on X constantly, sometimes many times a day, about Arizona politics (“Arizona elections are theater. Everyone knows it”); Somali immigration; Ashli Babbitt; Melania Trump’s movie; even former Ohio Governor John Kasich, whom she called “a pussy.” Although head of an agency whose broadcasters are mandated by law to be nonpartisan and editorially independent, she has four photographs of President Trump at the top of her X feed, where she has also pinned a long, wild screed about unspecified electoral fraud (“Why is NO ONE talking about this during a week when a lot of people are TALKING??? I think I know—because there is BIG money in keeping the corrupt, rigged elections going”).

Yet if Lake’s intention is to win Trump’s favor by broadcasting conspiracy theories, she is failing at that too. In October, she was spotted waiting in a White House lobby, hoping to see Trump, according to two GOP operatives. “Kari has been here for hours,” a White House aide told one of the operatives that day. “She’s going to run, and she’s asking for the endorsement.” Lake, who was rumored to be mulling a run for Congress in Arizona, eventually shared her pitch with a low-level aide who conveyed no enthusiasm for a third Lake candidacy, the same person said. The other Republican operative offered a similar account. When asked for comment on the episode, Lake responded in a statement that “every shred of this question is incorrect” and added, “The President has always been very gracious and generous when I have requested time with him.”

Whatever she does next, Lake will leave behind immense damage, as well as a legal quagmire, not least because the legal basis for her current position is peculiar. Because Trump removed most members of the bipartisan, Senate-confirmed board that oversees USAGM, depriving it of a quorum, Lake could not formally be appointed head of VOA. The head of USAGM has to be confirmed by the Senate, but for whatever reason, Trump didn’t want to go through the process. That’s why Lake arrived at USAGM with the title “special adviser.” She was promoted to “deputy CEO”; later she began calling herself the “acting CEO.” During a sworn deposition in two lawsuits brought by fired employees, she admitted that she had no documentation confirming her appointment to the latter position.

Once in place, several current and former staffers told us, Lake made little effort to understand the agency, its mission, or even the point of journalistic independence. A television-news anchor in Phoenix for more than two decades, she had a very limited background in international journalism, and during congressional testimony revealed that she did not know, for example, what language is spoken in Armenia, although VOA had an Armenian service. During her deposition, she could not think of any countries in Asia, other than China, that might not have adequate sources of free information; apparently North Korea did not come to mind.

Although she had no experience working with any of the institutions before, she did not initially consult with senior officials at the broadcasters. Rohit Mahajan, the chief communications officer for RFA, said that leaders of all of the broadcasters had approached Lake, and continue to do so, but to little effect. Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, said he tried unsuccessfully to engage Lake both directly and through intermediaries. In the end he met her twice, once by accident in a hallway and once when he came to hand her a briefing book prepared by his staff. She took it and indicated she would read it, but he never heard back. (Lake declined to comment on these specific allegations due to ongoing litigation.)

But that was not unusual; she kept her distance from others as well, multiple current and former staffers said. One VOA staffer reckons that she wasn’t in that building “more than a couple of times” in a six-month period. In the deposition, Lake said she primarily spent time at the State Department, where she was eventually given an office. But she didn’t ask many people to meet her there either. In her statement, Lake defended her commitment to the job, saying, “Frankly, most of your ‘sources’ probably wish I didn’t work so hard.”

The VOA staffer also said that new appointees then working with Lake seemed “distrustful of federal employees, as part of the so-called deep state.” Among these appointees were John Zadrozny, an anti-immigration campaigner and DHS official in the first Trump administration; Mora Namdar, who contributed to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025; and Frank Wuco, a former talk-radio host known for promoting birtherism and several other conspiracy theories.

A former USAGM executive nevertheless said some employees were initially hopeful about Lake, given her television experience. Perhaps, some thought, the outlet could have found an on-air role for her, or even created her own show. Another former employee said they had prepared proposals for institutional reform. But whatever plans Lake had originally made for the broadcasters ended in mid-March, when Trump signed an executive order designed to close the entire agency. Lake admitted under oath that this decision caught her by surprise. Nevertheless, perhaps egged on by criticism from the Trump aide Ric Grenell and from Musk—who described the broadcasters, collectively reaching hundreds of millions of people, as “radical left crazy people talking to themselves”—Lake instantly rushed to demolish the institution, even denigrating VOA as “rotten to the core.”

With the help of DOGE, she immediately began trying to cut grants to RFA, RFE/RL, and other agencies, forcing them to make emergency cuts in staff and programming. USAGM also fired about 500 VOA contractors, many of whom were journalists with unique language skills and contacts in difficult parts of the world. Because they are what Abramowitz described as “the guts of the language services,” people with years of experience and deep knowledge of their countries, their departure meant that many VOA programs became impossible to produce. Eventually most were shut down.

In addition, about 800 full-time employees were placed on paid administrative leave. During the following months, Lake and her team repeatedly tried to fire the agency staff, including journalists, editors, and tech support. But because Lake’s authority to discharge employees was uncertain, and because she and her aides did not comply with strict rules about so-called reductions in force in the federal government, Lake’s team kept running into legal hurdles that they seem not to have anticipated.

Even as Russian and Chinese state media were replacing American news reporting, USAGM was obligated to pay salaries and benefits to hundreds of people placed on leave. A minority report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations estimates that from March 15 through July 18 alone, USAGM paid hundreds of people more than $69 million not to work, and that cost has continued to grow. As of August, more than 500 people were still on administrative leave, still receiving salaries and benefits, and still barred from performing their duties. In September, a judge blocked another attempt to fire them. Since then, the federal government has likely paid them about $50 million more—an estimate based on average salary levels at the agency—while still preventing them from doing their jobs. Lake’s statement did not refute these numbers but instead blamed an “activist judge” for obstructing her plans.

Lake has taken the position that she is required by law to maintain merely a statutory minimum service at VOA, something far smaller than the broadcasts previously produced in 49 languages. Lake initially preserved service in only four languages (Mandarin, Dari, Pashto, and Farsi) but later added a few more, including Korean and Kurdish. Yet even as she continues to pay hundreds of experienced journalists and federal workers to remain on administrative leave, sources at VOA and USAGM told us that she is hiring more and more contractors. This may be because, as she has testified, she truly believes USAGM and its broadcasters are “rotten to the core.”

Toluse Olorunnipa: Kari Lake’s attempt to deport her own employees

Regardless, she seems to be replacing some journalists with propagandists. By law, all of the broadcasters are supposed to be nonpartisan, with a firewall between the journalists and the U.S. administration. The State Department puts out the administration’s views; the broadcasters are meant to be reporters, a distinction particularly important in places that don’t have any other independent media. But some of VOA’s newer material doesn’t appear to meet that standard. One recent article, originally published in Chinese, echoed the false claims that Trump likes to make about his own record: “Trump combined his dealmaking ability with diplomacy based on the concept of ‘peace through strength’ to secure agreements halting and restraining eight global conflicts in 2025.” VOA’s Mandarin-language Instagram feed recently began posting heroic, Photoshopped images of Trump with misty American flags and helicopters in the background.

In practice, this is another kind of waste. Trump did not halt or restrain eight global conflicts, and obvious pro-Trump puffery isn’t going to have the same kind of influence among Mandarin-speaking audiences as, say, the extraordinary reporting once done by Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur-language service, which had to be shut down when funding to the broadcaster was cut and only recently reopened with a limited service. In 2017, RFA broke the story of the Chinese government’s mass arrests of Uyghur people in Xinjiang, part of a crackdown that has since forced some 1.8 million people into concentration camps. This story also had an impact on international perceptions of China in a way that fictional tales of Trump’s diplomacy will not.

Lake’s decisions about USAGM property have also taken their toll. Before Trump returned to office, the agency had begun to move into new quarters. Its old building, constructed in 1939 for the Social Security Board, needed expensive renovations; reportedly had ancient, faulty wiring; was far too big; and was generally unsuitable for modern journalism. After an extensive search and a lengthy negotiation, the service contracted to lease a smaller office building on Pennsylvania Avenue. Although the total price tag of the 15-year lease was more than $200 million, a number that looks large, the annual cost was reportedly lower than that of the agency’s former quarters. The owner gave USAGM two years’ free rent, as well as an additional nine months without rent to move into the building; the previous leaseholder threw in office furniture as well. According to USAGM’s previous CEO, the savings from the deal would have come to more than $150 million over the course of the lease. Renovations had begun, and some staff had already moved in.

In March, Lake abruptly canceled the lease. The former USAGM executive and another person with knowledge of the transaction say that she and her team did not follow the specified termination procedures. Lake’s team did not want to reimburse the owner’s costs, which the people close to the deal said initially came to about $16 million. The executive believes that this is because any payment undercut their argument that “it’s cheaper to get rid of these things than to keep them.” Theoretically, the building’s owner could add to the list of lawsuits against Lake, and a court could now hold USAGM, and thus U.S. taxpayers, liable for the entire 15-year lease. (In her statement, Lake maintained that canceling the lease reduced the agency’s costs and will save more than $225 million over 10 years.)

Meanwhile, office leases and other contracts around the world have been canceled, sometimes incurring additional costs, by VOA as well as the other broadcasters, staffers said. Further losses are mounting. USAGM also continues to pay to update and maintain its transmission capabilities in multiple countries around the world, even though they are now being used less often, and even though Lake has prevented some of the services from using them. Lake is also engaged in a series of lawsuits, some of which she appears to have made only minimal effort to fight. RFE/RL has won several cases that have allowed it to remain open. Employees of VOA, RFA, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network have also received favorable court rulings.  One federal judge, Royce Lamberth, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, has pointed out that when Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for 2025, it did not intend the money to be used to cut programming and keep employees at home. “The legal term for that is ‘waste,’ he said, “and it is precisely what federal appropriation law aims to avoid.”

No one can say Lake lacks enthusiasm for the cause of shutting down the agency. During the course of the year, she has railed against USAGM, baselessly accused Voice of America of taking instruction from the Chinese Communist Party, and canceled visas for the foreign employees of the broadcasters, forcing them to leave the United States immediately and, in the case of some from repressive countries, scramble to find somewhere safe to live. “There was no caretaking to deal with that issue at all,” said Kathryn Neeper, director of strategy at USAGM, now on administrative leave. Lake did take time to make a slick video about the new VOA building whose lease she canceled, describing it as luxurious and overpriced.

More recently, after congressional appropriators began talking about bringing the agency’s funding back, she switched tack. She visited the Miami headquarters of Radio Martí—which is part of the Office of Cuban Broadcasting, beloved by Cuban American politicians, the broadcaster least affected by her purge—and even met staff last week at the main headquarters of RFE/RL in Prague.

She has lauded the work of the skeleton VOA services in Persian and installed a new leader for them—albeit a controversial, seemingly partisan one—even as she continued to prevent RFE/RL’s Radio Farda from accessing transmission services. Lake asserted in her statement that RFE/RL leaders “were putting out a message that was counter to US policy” and that she was helping them “align their messaging with American foreign policy and national security strategy.” But that assertion again reflects a deep misunderstanding of what RFE/RL is supposed to do. According to long-standing statute, the broadcaster has “professional independence,” providing not American messaging but real journalism in places where there are few alternatives.

Lake herself never pretends not to be partisan, keeping up a constant stream of praise and adulation for Trump, the “Trump Kennedy Center,” Charlie Kirk, and other MAGA heroes. But the Lake era at USAGM might look very different, even to Republicans, once the costs and losses of her year in charge are counted. Not only has she wasted money; she hasn’t won many arguments. In recent weeks, Congress rejected Lake’s requests to cut funding to a bare minimum and allotted USAGM something approaching previous levels of funding. Lake will retain the ability to undermine the broadcasters, but her expensive, monthslong, legally dubious attempt to destroy them has so far failed.

The uncertain future of her role might explain why Lake was said to be sitting in a White House waiting room in October, trying to get the president’s endorsement for a congressional race. But even if she had his blessing, a return to Arizona politics will be difficult. The Republican consultant and pollster Paul Bentz told us that MAGA voters in Arizona have moved on from Lake: “MAGA’s got other people that they’ve put at the forefront,” Bentz said. “They’ve got better candidates that they like more.” In October, a “war room” account on X affiliated with her past campaigns accused Fox News and Bret Baier of blacklisting her.

In her statement, Lake did not directly answer a question about whether she would seek a congressional seat, saying only, “If and when I decide to run for office, The Atlantic will be the very last to know.” Soon after allegedly being turned away at the White House, Lake also bought a condo in her native Iowa, according to MS Now, perhaps to try her luck in politics there. She can then explain to Iowa voters how much damage she did to American interests and communications around the world, as well as what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars she squandered on their behalf.</div>

            <h2>What Happened to the Great American Protest Concert?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/artists-for-aid-gaza-sudan-protest-music/685937/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In early January, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, a concert benefit for Palestine and Sudan conjured all the fury of an acoustic night at the local coffee shop. Musicians played stripped-down songs on a stage decorated with rugs, floor lamps, and couches. Members of the audience, mostly 20-somethings and teens, leaned in and filmed intimate performances by their favorite cult artists.

But the quiet broke late in the evening when a woman with a mane of red curls walked onstage. Shrieks and screams rang out as people recognized the surprise guest: the 27-year-old superstar Chappell Roan.

I’d come to watch precisely because no one of Roan’s stature had been slated to play what have been, to date, the American music world’s only major communal performances in response to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The concert, titled Artists for Aid, featured a 20-artist lineup of if-you-know-you-know types—such as the buzz band Geese and the TikTok-beloved Ravyn Lenae—plus Shawn Mendes, a recovering pop heartthrob who hasn’t had a hit in years. The previous two installments of Artists for Aid, which took place in 2024 in New Jersey and London, had received scant media attention. I wanted to find out why a war that has sparked intense outrage worldwide had inspired relatively low-wattage and under-the-radar efforts in American music—and whether that might be changing.

Music is the art form most associated with protest, and its history is full of united actions against war and humanitarian crises. Think of Woodstock-era sung-and-spoken condemnations of the Vietnam War, the 1980s megaconcerts and charity singles inspired by famine in Ethiopia and apartheid in South Africa, and the Rock Against Bush compilations that challenged America’s invasion of Iraq. Only a few years ago, pop music overflowed with sloganeering lyrics and concert rallies related to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Donald Trump. But in the 2020s, much of that energy has mellowed—or at least been dispersed into individuals’ scattered statements and social-media posts.

Gaza is a big part of why. The 2023 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel, including 378 people at the Nova music festival, spurred a military response that has decimated Gaza and resulted in at least 70,000 deaths. Among countries historically allied with Israel—prime among them the U.S.—the fallout has inflamed tensions over free expression. Though polls show that a majority of Americans now have an unfavorable view of Israel—an 11-point increase from before the war—the ensuing protests have faced unusual social and legal consequences. Universities whose students demonstrated against the war have been subject to sweeping government investigations and sanctions justified as efforts against hate speech. Activists have been targeted for deportation on the basis of protests they’ve been involved in or, in at least one case, because of an op-ed they’d written.

A confluence of factors have made Gaza a particularly risky situation to speak out about. One is the clear and rising tide of anti-Semitism worldwide. Defenders of Israel have often argued that a critique of Zionism is an attack on all Jews—thereby collapsing the distinctions among, for example, the bigoted conspiracy theories of Louis Farrakhan, the extremism of fringe activists who cheer for Hamas, and the moral objections levied by mainstream voices for Palestinian rights (many of whom are Jewish themselves). The bloody history of the conflict has made it so that some people interpret the language of Palestinian liberation as a call for the wanton murder of Israelis. These dynamics have been leveraged by lobbyists for Israel and by politicians of both major U.S. parties to subject the broader pro-Palestine movement to a level of scrutiny way beyond what other contemporary causes have been subject to. Cultural institutions and businesses looking to avoid controversy are motivated to embrace that scrutiny.

The music world has learned this a number of times. Last April, the R&B singer Kehlani was disinvited from a concert at Cornell after a pro-Israel student group flagged her history of strident anti-Zionism, including a music video of hers featuring the phrase “Long live the intifada.” Intifada is an Arabic word for “uprising” that many hear as a call for violence against Jews. Her concert in Central Park was later canceled after the office of New York City’s then-Mayor Eric Adams raised concerns about public safety. In a video message prior to the second cancellation, Kehlani called herself “not anti-Semitic” but rather “anti-genocide.” She also alluded to losing other career opportunities because of her criticism of Israel.

Kehlani, a singer known for her queer sex jams and fixation on astrology, hardly fits the stereotype of a militant. Some of music’s most headline-grabbing advocates for Palestine have been more extreme and faced more extreme consequences. The Irish band Kneecap is a rap trio steeped in the history of Irish republicanism—one member wears a balaclava. They had signaled admiration for terrorist groups—“Up Hamas, up Hezbollah,” shouted one member at a November 2024 concert—before controversy erupted over their pro-Palestine statements at Coachella 2025. After U.K. police opened a terrorism investigation (resulting in a charge against one member that was eventually dropped) and the group lost its visa sponsor in the U.S., Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah, and that they “condemn all attacks on civilians, always.”

Another example: Last year, the front man of the rap duo Bob Vylan chanted “Death, death to the IDF!” at the Glastonbury Festival in the U.K. Following condemnation from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the revocation of their visas by the U.S. State Department, the band put out a statement saying: “We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine.” Later, when one of its concert crowds tried to get a “Death to IDF” chant going, Bob Vylan’s vocalist encouraged them to instead say “Free Palestine,” lest the band get in more trouble.

Performers who flirt with murderous rhetoric and ideologies hardly make ideal mascots for the pro-Palestine movement, or for anyone else who advocates to end, not intensify, violence in the Middle East. Even so, these controversies have demonstrated that what artists say about this issue is not treated with the deference that creative expression is traditionally afforded in democracies. Hip-hop, rock and roll, and even country music are full of revolutionary rhetoric and bloodthirsty threats. As First Amendment advocates have had to repeatedly point out lately, a legal distinction exists between making statements and committing or materially supporting violence. When government officials weigh in on what’s acceptable to say onstage, it not only limits the definition of free speech but sends a cautionary message to all kinds of cultural figures: artists, labels, venues.

The music industry wrestled with tensions related to Palestine before October 7. Boycott campaigns against Israel, which have been under way for decades, garnered support from artists including Elvis Costello, Patti Smith, and Questlove. In 2012, pro-Israel forces in the entertainment industry formed the anti-boycott activist group Creative Community for Peace, which was supported by industry figures such as the famous artist manager Scooter Braun and the Atlantic Music Group CEO Elliot Grainge.

Since October 7, many pro-Palestinian artists have said that they feel at odds with prevailing attitudes in their industry. Brian Eno said on Instagram that one of the biggest regrets of his career was that “so many of us have remained silent about Palestine. Often that silence has come from fear—real fear—that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.” Last year, the trip-hop group Massive Attack formed an alliance intended to support pro-Palestinian artists in the face of “intimidation” from within the industry. More than 1,000 artists and labels have backed a new boycott effort to geo-block their music from being streamed in Israel.

But signing a petition is one thing, and organizing a show is another. The storied benefit shows and protests of music history were logistical undertakings that involved many parties—booking agents, promoters, venues, multiple artists. When it comes to Gaza, pulling off such an effort might be especially complex, given how viewpoints and appetites for blowback will vary from party to party. Nevertheless, Eno helped put on a benefit, Together for Palestine, in London last year. And Artists for Aid has emerged as America’s primary musical response—cautiously.

The Artists for Aid shows are benefits, not protests. They have paired advocacy for Palestine with advocacy for the people of Sudan, where a civil war has raged since 2023 and cost at least 150,000 lives. In Los Angeles, $5.5 million were raised for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund and the Sudanese American Physicians Association. The model Bella Hadid, one of the two hosts (the other was the actor Pedro Pascal), spoke about “families living through unimaginable loss, displacement, hunger, violence.” The Palestinian American poet Noor Hindi and the Sudanese American poet Safia Elhillo described the devastation of their homelands. But none of the speeches named a protagonist—a state, a leader—responsible for the destruction they mourned.

This circumspection was by design. “I’m trying to be really careful about the way that I present these concerts to the world,” Mustafa, the 29-year-old singer-songwriter who’d organized the venture, told me the day after the concert. Although he anticipated that some critics would find Artists for Aid to be too soft-focus, too vague in its objectives, Mustafa intentionally discouraged political callouts from stage. The shows were meant to give musicians an opportunity to “communicate their solidarity through song,” he said. “Because that is the thing they practice their whole life. That is the language that they know.”

The circumstances we met in reminded me that the Palestinian cause isn’t without behind-the-scenes support. Mustafa, formerly known as Mustafa the Poet, was staying at a stunning mansion in Bel Air that a donor had rented in order to house a few of the artists who played the show. Pizza boxes were strewn about from the night before, and a few straggling musicians and associates were puttering around, dipping their feet in the infinity pool. Mustafa’s 2024 debut album, Dunya—a folk memoir about growing up as a devout Muslim in a violent Toronto housing project as the son of immigrants from Sudan—was wildly acclaimed. He’s a pop insider who’s had a birthday dinner thrown for him by Drake and who has helped write songs for Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and the Jonas Brothers.

Despite that industry clout, he told me, he had trouble securing a venue for the benefit. Mustafa said he and his team had approached multiple locations in the Los Angeles area, but most declined the booking without explanation. At one point, after the show had been announced but before a stage had been confirmed, he considered canceling it and releasing “the list of all of the venues that refuse to accept me.” The problem wasn’t demand: The show had sold out within minutes, and scalpers listed tickets online with exorbitant markups. Mustafa had wanted to book an arena that could fit tens of thousands of people. Instead, Artists for Aid ended up in the 6,300-person Shrine Auditorium. “We weren’t in the Shrine by choice,” he said. “Really we were in the Shrine by circumstance.”

Confirming performers wasn’t simple either. According to Mustafa, he secured most of the evening’s lineup himself, coordinating with artists directly via text message, sometimes to the surprise of their managers. But it didn’t seem to be the full bill he’d hoped for. A number of artists who’d signed on to perform backed out just before the show’s announcement, offering what he felt were flimsy excuses. One musician—“I swear to God, one of the bigger artists in the world,” Mustafa said—declined by saying that they didn’t want to invite “the sting of the establishment.”

Still, some of the bigger artists in the world did pop up. Roan had called the singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus, who was on the bill, a few days before the show and asked to duet with her. The two ended up playing a wistful cover of the Magnetic Fields’ wry ballad “The Book of Love.” Backstage, Olivia Rodrigo posed for photos. (A few weeks later, Rodrigo announced that she’d covered that same Magnetic Fields song for a compilation album to raise money for War Child UK, a charity helping kids in conflict zones worldwide.)

The presence of these Gen Z icons seemed to reflect a generational divide when it comes to musical activism. For years, the most famous mainstream benefits have been headlined by a class of musicians associated with the Democratic establishment—Bruce Springsteen, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys. Over the past year, many in that class have continued to work in the familiar mode of anti-Trump resistance, as with Springsteen’s new song about the turmoil in Minneapolis. But Gaza has defied the dynamics of party politics; Roan rejected calls to endorse the Democrats in 2024 because of the party’s support of Israel, among other issues (though she said she voted for Kamala Harris anyway). Artists for Aid was for and largely by the generation that upended American political discourse after October 7 with campus sit-ins, the generation that hardly seems daunted by the crackdowns against them.

Some in the audience wore keffiyehs or T-shirts indicating their activist bona fides. But most just looked like fashionable music fans, flaunting boots and baggy denim while taking selfies. They screamed out wildly for Dacus, Daniel Caesar, Clairo, Faye Webster, and Omar Apollo—young gods of the bedroom-pop pantheon that has flourished in the streaming era. Many of those musicians are among the more than 600 people who’ve signed on to the Artists4Ceasefire effort that began in 2023.

Those artists largely sang their own songs, but certain lyrics and sounds took on a special resonance. The show opened with the Geese front man Cameron Winter, the current It Boy of indie rock and a 23-year-old Jewish person whose music is filled with references to war and God (he played another, smaller Gaza benefit in Ridgewood, Queens, not long after). He sang a gorgeous rendition of an unreleased track called “If You Turn Back Now.” Its fluttering piano runs sent a message: Settle in; focus; feel something.

Is it enough to let the music speak? I’d gone into the concert suspecting it to be a tragically late and modest effort—coming, as it did, after a cease-fire had been brokered and, despite continued violence in the region, a host of other crises had grabbed the public’s attention. And the show itself hardly turned out to be bold in its presentation. But as I watched artist after artist, from a variety of genres, step up, play, and hand the mic on to the next singer—as other performers watched, swaying their heads, from couches around the stage—my cynicism faded. The overlap between an artistic scene, a demographic wave, and a political movement was being made visible and tangible. Many of the musicians and audience members belonged to a generation that’s often stereotyped as languishing in apathy and isolation—but whose indignation about the suffering in Gaza has far outpaced that of other generations. And given all the ambient discouragement against speaking up about this particular cause, solidarity isn’t just a buzzword. It matters that so many of music’s rising guard have gone on the record.

In the weeks since then, I’ve thought back to Artists for Aid’s conscientious approach while a broader thaw has taken place in America regarding protest. The pushback against immigration agents in Minneapolis has been peaceful, coordinated, and focused—and, it seems, has gotten results. At least some of the politicians, celebrities, and business leaders who have fallen into silence or acquiescence during the past year of multifront overreach from the Trump administration are finally saying that something’s amiss in America, if in measured language. Gaza showed how power brokers from the White House on down seem eager for pretexts to punish dissent in ways that create a chilling effect, and that the hottest rhetoric from activists can be exactly that pretext. The effective protest movements to emerge from these circumstances will show wisdom in choosing when to shout and when to communicate by other means.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris arrived at their first Sundance Film Festival feeling worn down. Making their debut feature, Little Miss Sunshine, had taken much longer than they’d anticipated; financing hiccups had forced the pair to spend years rescuing the film from development hell. But by the time Dayton and Faris left Park City, Utah, in January 2006, they were practically rock stars: Little Miss Sunshine, about a scrappy family trying to make it to a children’s beauty pageant, had become a festival darling, prompting an all-night bidding war among distribution companies. Fox Searchlight, the victor, bought the film for a then-record-setting $10.5 million and immediately sent the couple on a tour of more than 20 cities to drum up interest in the movie before its summer release.

In the months following the festival, Dayton and Faris went from theater to theater, watching audiences absorb their work. They participated in Q&A after Q&A. Eventually they wound up at the Oscars, where Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for Best Picture. “It changed our lives, coming here,” Dayton told me when we met at this year’s Sundance.

Faris, sitting next to him, noted that the two didn’t return to the festival in the 20 years since their film’s premiere for a reason. “That experience was so monumental,” she said, “that it was sort of hard to imagine coming back and not having that.”

Throughout its 40-plus years in Park City, Sundance has earned a reputation for offering new filmmakers an unbeatable time. The festival, which spotlights independent films, launched the careers of directors such as Steven Soderbergh, Todd Haynes, and Richard Linklater; more recent alumni include Chloé Zhao, Ryan Coogler, and Celine Song. In the 1990s and 2000s, Sundance was an offbeat destination for Hollywood’s creative talent, rejecting the glitz of European festivals and the solemnity of awards season in favor of strong movies that garnered word-of-mouth interest. (The Sundance Institute, the nonprofit organization behind the festival, also cultivates emerging artists through its series of labs and fellowships.) In 1999, the premiere of The Blair Witch Project ushered in the era of found-footage horror; five years later, Napoleon Dynamite won over festivalgoers, who later helped enter “Vote for Pedro” into the pop-culture lexicon. Sundance could anoint hits, dotting the industry’s creative landscape with unlikely blockbusters.

Yet I had a hard time picturing that version of Sundance while at this year’s festival, which concluded earlier this month. Main Street, without any screenings at the picturesque Egyptian Theater, wasn’t particularly crowded. Nights were tame and quiet for the most part, other than the evening of the afterparty for The Moment (a mockumentary starring Charli XCX), which took place at a hilltop club. Plenty of showings around town were sold out, but few generated feverish headlines about bidding wars during the festival’s run—a worrying development for the filmmakers who come to Sundance in hopes of finding a distributor for their work. Even the weather seemed off: Park City, usually blanketed in snow this time of year, was warm enough for some locals to walk around in just long-sleeved shirts.

Part of the muted atmosphere probably had to do with the fact that this year’s Sundance was the final one held in Park City before the festival’s move to Boulder, Colorado, in 2027—as well as the fact that this was the first edition since the passing of Sundance’s founder, the actor Robert Redford, in September. But the downbeat mood also seemed to reflect the lackluster indie-film business that’s been dogging the festival for years. The box-office success stories of the ’90s and 2000s—The Blair Witch Project, Saw, Four Weddings and a Funeral, (500) Days of Summer—inspired distributors to pour tens of millions into acquiring projects at the festival over the following decade, in the hope of discovering a critical and cultural phenomenon that could also turn a profit. Yet only a few films ever offered a substantial return on the financial investment; the last major box-office hit to break out of Sundance was 2017’s Get Out, which earned nearly $260 million. Last year, only two out of the 10 U.S. competition entries—Sorry, Baby and Twinless—grossed more than $1 million worldwide.

Of course, Sundance has always operated as a microcosm of Hollywood’s wider shifts. This year’s final rodeo in Park City seemed marked by the uncertainty generated by ongoing industry woes—massive studio mergers, job insecurity, and the growing use of AI during production, among others. While at the festival, I spoke with many filmmakers who were bringing their directorial debuts to Sundance. Having their work selected remains an achievement, but traveling to a popular, pricey ski destination such as Park City, many of them told me, feels riskier than ever. The cost of bringing a small movie there hoping to lock down distribution may not pay off, given buyers’ dwindling interest. “Sundance was like that island on the horizon that I could never get to, that I applied to every year, to the labs, and never got in,” Vera Miao, the writer-director of the contemplative ghost story Rock Springs, said. But, she added, “it’s extremely expensive. You know, you want people here, and everyone wants to be here. It’s just an incredible moment of celebration and community, and the tension of that has been a hard one.”

Some films that played in Park City this year arrived with name recognition and instant buzz: a drama starring Channing Tatum, a black comedy from Olivia Wilde. The director John Wilson could also be considered something of a known quantity. As the creator of the irreverent HBO docuseries How to With John Wilson, he has gained a cult audience for his rollicking work built on seemingly prosaic subjects—including, in one notable short film, his own failed efforts to get his work accepted into Sundance. Almost 10 years later, Wilson’s feature directorial debut was selected as one of Sundance’s opening-night films. The History of Concrete, a documentary that captures the director’s attempts to finance a project ostensibly about, yes, concrete, has been well received: The morning of our interview, we had planned to meet at the theater in which the film was being screened, but then had to find another spot—there were too many attendees crowding the cinema.

Several quality documentaries have emerged from Sundance in recent years; all five of this year’s Oscar nominees debuted there. Yet as of this writing, The History of Concrete still hasn’t found a distributor. Wilson, for his part, didn’t seem to spend all of his time in Park City thinking about the film’s chances of landing a buyer. Certainly he’d like to find a distributor, he told me, so he can pay back his collaborators. But as “existentially terrifying” as it is to think about how much steeper the slope has become for indie filmmakers, he said, “doing your best to not consider the market in a certain way is the strongest kind of start you can have.” The movie’s aim, he added, is to remind viewers that “people shouldn’t be afraid to create.”

Wilson isn’t alone in shutting out the noise of the industry’s upheaval. Stephanie Ahn, the director of the tender romance Bedford Park, told me that her film had taken almost 10 years to make—years she spent searching for financing and readjusting her goals depending on the resources available to her. “On the other side of it, the world that your film might encounter might be very different than what you expected,” Ahn said, “and you just have to be okay with that.”

Before being accepted into Sundance with Bedford Park, Ahn said, she had submitted her work what felt like hundreds of times. At the start of her career, she imagined the kind of reception she might get if she made it to Park City, her reveries riffing on the success stories she kept hearing about. (Little Miss Sunshine’s trajectory—the word-of-mouth momentum, the bidding wars, the rock stardom—was once the standard.) “When I was younger and striving to be a filmmaker and striving at Sundance, I fantasized about what it would be like,” she explained. “I think I let go of the fantasy some years ago.” She added, “I think a lot of us have let go of the old way of success.”

Bedford Park turned out to be a festival rarity: The film sold to Sony Pictures Classics, becoming one of just five narrative titles to land a buyer out of Park City so far. That statistic underlines just how hesitant companies have become to acquire indie projects. The internet offers various other distribution channels and ways to promote your film outside of a festival, some of the filmmakers I spoke with said. Sundance’s core value, then, is to offer a venue to showcase work to an invested, film-loving viewership.

Elaine Del Valle, a writer and producer of the visually inventive documentary TheyDream and a director herself, is a Sundance veteran who has begun to rely on grassroots tactics. For her most recent feature, last year’s coming-of-age drama Brownsville Bred, she skipped Sundance and reached out to theater chains before finding a distributor at a smaller film festival. By that point, Del Valle just wanted to share her work with an audience who cared. “It’s not about the money,” she told me. “It’s about the value.” These days, she does as much as she can on her own. “I say to myself, I run a studio,” she said. “What part of my studio needs my attention most today?”

Sundance has long championed that indie sensibility, elevating work produced outside of the studio system off a shoestring budget. But in order to remain a meaningful platform for creative renegades, the festival needs to also take risks. At least, that’s what the filmmaker (and Robert’s daughter) Amy Redford told me when I spoke with her the night before screenings began. “More and more, I think what we will see is people finding a way to get their stories out there on their own terms, because they can,” she said. In some ways, she pointed out, the festival’s forthcoming move to Boulder may offer a chance for a reset. “Sometimes,” Redford said, “you need to change your landscape to understand what you’re made of,” even if that change is as simple—or, as she put it, “exciting and messy and imperfect”—as relocating to a different town.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Countless American downtowns are struggling to find their identity, and their tax base, after the convulsions of the COVID-era remote-work experiment. But only one major city is poised to demolish its seat of government.

That would be Dallas, where leaders say the monumental I. M. Pei–designed City Hall is in such bad shape that the city might be better off tearing it down and relocating the government into vacant office buildings nearby. That could create an enormous plot for the Dallas Mavericks, whose casino-company owners, the Adelson-Dumont family, want to build what Mavs CEO Rick Welts calls a “full-blown entertainment district” around their new basketball arena. One of the team’s owners, Miriam Adelson, has also been lobbying to legalize casino gambling in Texas, raising the possibility that Dallas City Hall might ultimately be razed for a casino—a perfect symbol for our era of civic impoverishment and gambling addiction.

This half-baked vision may be the nation’s worst downtown-revival strategy, and not only because it would destroy the city’s one-of-a-kind Brutalist colossus. The imagined payoff—a brand-new, suburban-style entertainment district—is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes downtowns worthy of their designation in the first place.

No doubt City Hall needs some work. Dallas began deliberations over the building’s fate this past fall, but the discussion was complicated by staff’s varying estimates of the deferred maintenance bill: The high end was $93 million in 2018, so could it really be $595 million today? Could citizens trust estimates from a government that had just been forced to auction off a new building for its permitting department because it was not up to code? City Hall’s defenders were suspicious to see the eye-watering tab arrive right as the Mavs came looking for a place to play.

The special tragedy of City Hall’s fate is that the building was designed, not so long ago, to represent Dallas’s growth and ambition in a different moment of uncertainty. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dealey Plaza, Mayor J. Erik Jonsson envisioned a new building as part of reforms to repair Dallas’s reputation as the “city of hate.” After an extensive listening tour, the Chinese American Pei—a novel choice to design a public building in Texas but, notably, the architect of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, in Boston—concluded that Dallas needed something grand enough to match the pride of its citizens, and sturdy enough to represent the public sector across from the corporate skyscrapers nearby. He persuaded the reluctant city council to buy a huge block of land for a public plaza to properly orient the building toward the central business district.

Kaid Benfield: From concrete desert to oasis: Designing a better Dallas

The result, which took more than a decade to finance and construct, is a tremendous concrete anvil with its facade leaning at a vertiginous 34 degrees, 74 feet wider at its roof than at its entrance. Jonsson thought the building was a good reflection of the city. “It’s strong, and the people of Dallas are strong people,” he said. “Concrete is simple, and they are simple people—in the best sense of the word, plain people. So the monolithic structure was entirely appropriate.” But the triangular profile wasn’t just form for form’s sake: Pei hoped that by concentrating the bureaucracy on the upper floors, he would offer arriving citizens a neat and clean experience of government. Mark Lamster, the architecture critic at The Dallas Morning News, has written that no building better exemplifies Dallas: City Hall was “forthright, brash, inventive, optimistic, futuristic and downright beautiful.”

In the years since, not everyone has experienced the building as the city’s welcoming front porch. In his 1990 biography of Pei, Carter Wiseman observed that the building could come across as unfriendly, standoffish, and even ominous: “It seems to frown under the load of municipal responsibility it contains.” The writer Edward McPherson likened it to an “architectural bully, looming overhead, dwarfing the individual and threatening to crush all who dare enter the halls of civic duty.” For Americans of a certain age, the building might be most famous for its role as the evil corporate headquarters in the 1987 film RoboCop. “It has more strength than finesse, Pei himself conceded: “There’s a lot of brute force in this building.” And some people think it’s just plain ugly.

All of which has influenced the public conversation over whether the structure is worth the cost of repairs. Many architects have lined up to save the building, and the designer Steven Holl has written to the mayor that its demolition would be a “crime.” Some locals do not see it that way. “The building has too many limitations and not enough of the assets that make for a functional hub of office work or civic pride,” the developer Shawn Todd wrote in The Dallas Morning News last year. He is part of a chorus of real-estate developers saying that Dallas should tear it down.

Technically, the question of City Hall’s viability is being considered in isolation: What are the costs of fixing the building, and what are the costs of leaving it? But well understood in Dallas is that should the government pack up and go, one developer in particular is on the lookout for a big parcel downtown. A Mavericks-arena district could occupy the vacated land, plus a bunch of empty blocks around it. And the conversation is taking place against a backdrop of more existential questions about the city’s place in the larger, 8.3-million-person region.

On January 5, one of Downtown Dallas’s largest employers, AT&T, announced that it would be moving its headquarters to nearby Plano. That will exacerbate a 27.2 percent office-vacancy rate, one of the highest in the country, according to CoStar data reported by The Wall Street Journal.

One reason for the relocation is particularly concerning for Dallas boosters: By moving more than 20 miles north of downtown, AT&T says it will be closer to most of its workers. It’s common for suburban headquarters to be convenient for a company’s CEO, but the fact that such a location is better for the majority of AT&T’s workforce illustrates how far north the region’s center of gravity has shifted. It’s a mortal threat: What is downtown but the easiest place for the greatest number of people to get to? “To call downtown the center is no longer really true,” Patrick Kennedy, a board member of Dallas Area Rapid Transit, told me. “If you look at the job center based on traffic volume, it’s now some amorphous place up near 635 and the tollway. There’s been so much growth to the north, and so little investment in the south.”

That economic migration is one reason that Plano’s mayor no longer wants to be part of DART, which connects Dallas to Plano by light rail and anchors downtown’s place as the center of the region. Plano is one of five suburbs, with a combined population of 600,000, that will hold a vote this spring on whether to secede. (In its place, the suburban mutineers are proposing some kind of subsidized taxi service.)

Jonathan Chait: Democrats mess with winning in Texas

In Texas, the question of mass-transit funding is closely tied to the local hunt for corporations and sports teams. The state limits local sales-tax revenue to 2 percent. Every penny that goes to buses and trains is a penny that cannot be spent nabbing a company from a neighboring city—a strategy that feels newly relevant in Dallas’s peripheral business centers, which are out of cheap land and fenced in by still-younger suburbs.

Irving, a suburban rival northwest of Dallas, will also hold a special election this year to determine whether to sever its transit connections to the city and pocket that tax money for other purposes. Last year, Irving rezoned 1,000 acres of land recently purchased by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, whose COO, Patrick Dumont, is also in charge of the Mavericks, for a “high-intensity mixed use district” that would permit an arena with more than 15,000 seats. The Mavericks insist that’s what they want to build in Dallas, but the suburban escape hatch gives them leverage.

The Mavs originally set their deadline for March, which happens to be right after the Dallas Economic Development Corporation will publicly present the results of its City Hall assessment.

Dallas is in a tough spot: No one likes to see a team move out. Texas has strict rules on the use of eminent domain for economic development, which limits the city’s power to assemble a complex urban site for the team—unless it’s on city-owned land. But trading City Hall for an arena would be short-sighted, overestimating the power of stadiums as engines of regeneration and underestimating the value of a public asset.

Many stadium-led developments disappoint, and students of those deals say that people who point to sports as the source of revitalization in San Diego or Baltimore, for example, mistake correlation for causation. Stadiums usually require huge amounts of public subsidy, in land or tax breaks. They tend to be islands of activity whose spillover effects end at the parking garage (casinos are even worse). They are good for some businesses (bars) but not so much for others (grocery stores, doctor’s offices). They cannibalize jobs and spending that might have occurred elsewhere in the city, and hang the prior stadium and associated neighborhood out to dry—in the Mavs’ case, the 25-year-old American Airlines Center, which is a mile away.

Stadium megadevelopments that entice the public’s contribution with the promise of neighborhood renewal are under way in cities such as Nashville and Washington, D.C., but there is always a risk that economic conditions change and reality falls short of the plans. Such a scenario wouldn’t be the first time a failure to launch led to another parking lot in Downtown Dallas: City Hall itself was designed to permit an extension in the back; now the site is parking.

The push to abandon City Hall is even more reckless. Tearing down the building would trade today’s cost of repair for the cost of demolition, and tomorrow’s maintenance for rent. It would forfeit a purpose-built structure with grounds for public protest, city-council chambers, soaring interior spaces, and a municipal garage for a few vacant floors of office space that no one else wants. It would sacrifice a symbol of the city at a time when downtown’s sense of identity is wavering, to add one more empty lot to a neighborhood that is full of them. It would destroy an irreplaceable piece of America’s cultural heritage to facilitate a real-estate project that could, by the Mavericks’ own admission, just as soon be plopped down by the side of a highway.

For decades, a fatal assumption of American downtowns has been that, to compete, they must offer their best approximation of the big, blank parcels and ample parking of their suburban rivals. It’s an impossible game to win. Dallas might instead try to be different. It’s not hard to imagine a stadium district that enfolds City Hall, embracing the contrast and the uniqueness of the historic building in its midst. The jumble, juxtaposition, and surprise of parcel-by-parcel development can distinguish a downtown even when it has lost its claim as the economic center.

This is already happening in Dallas, where the residential population downtown has increased from a few hundred to more than 15,000 over the past two decades, in part thanks to piecemeal conversions of obsolete office buildings. A trio of Dallas architects has made the case that City Hall and the arena could have a symbiotic relationship in a renewed, resident-anchored downtown that would benefit from being busy at all times of day.

That means planning for something other than drivers from elsewhere, with safer and slower streets, local businesses, and redevelopment incentives for vacant lots. That kind of organic growth is what sets a city up to resist the lure of the suburbs and lowers the stakes of negotiations with giants such as AT&T and the Mavs. Nothing is terribly exciting about investing in shade trees or crosswalks, but at least a crosswalk never traded Luka Dončić.</div>

            <h2>AI Is Getting Scary Good at Making Predictions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/ai-prediction-human-forecasters/685955/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To live in time is to wonder what will happen next. In every human society, there are people who obsess over the world’s patterns to predict the future. In antiquity, they told kings which stars would appear at nightfall. Today they build the quantitative models that nudge governments into opening spigots of capital. They pick winners on Wall Street. They estimate the likelihood of earthquakes for insurance companies. They tell commodities traders at hedge funds about the next month’s weather.

For years, some elite forecasters have been competing against one another in tournaments where they answer questions about events that will happen—or not—in the coming months or years. The questions span diverse subject matter because they’re meant to measure general forecasting ability, not narrow expertise. Players may be asked whether a coup will occur in an unstable country, or to project the future deforestation rate in some part of the Amazon. They may be asked how many songs from a forthcoming Taylor Swift album will top the streaming charts. The forecaster who makes the most accurate predictions, as early as possible, can earn a cash prize and, perhaps more important, the esteem of the world’s most talented seers.

These tournaments have become much more popular during the recent boom of prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, where hundreds of thousands of people around the world now trade billions of dollars a month on similar sorts of forecasting questions. And now AIs are playing in them, too. At first, the bots didn’t fare too well: At the end of 2024, no AI had even managed to place 100th in one of the major competitions. But they have since vaulted up the leaderboards. AIs have already proved that they can make superhuman predictions within the bounded context of a board game, but they may soon be better than us at divining the future of our entire messy, contingent world.

Three times a year, the forecasting platform Metaculus hosts a tournament that is known to have especially difficult questions. It generally attracts the more serious forecasters, Ben Shindel, a materials scientist who ranked third among participants in a recent competition, told me. Last year, at its Summer Cup, a London-based start-up called Mantic entered an AI prediction engine. Like other participants, the Mantic AI had to answer 60 questions by assigning probabilities to certain outcomes. The AI had to guess how the battle lines in Ukraine would shift. It had to pick the winner of the Tour de France and estimate Superman’s global box-office gross during its opening weekend. It had to say whether China would ban the export of a rare earth element, and predict whether a major hurricane would strike the Atlantic coast before September. It had to figure out whether Elon Musk and Donald Trump would disparage each other, in public, within a certain range of dates.

A few months later, the guesses from Mantic’s prediction engine and the other tournament participants were scored against the real-life outcomes and one another. The AI placed eighth out of more than 500 entrants, a new record for a bot. “It was an unexpected breakthrough” according to Toby Shevlane, Mantic’s CEO. Shevlane told me that he left a cushy gig as a research scientist at Google DeepMind to co-found the company. He wanted to celebrate the AI’s triumph, but he worried that it had been the product of some lucky guesses. He and his team entered a new version of it into the Metaculus Fall Cup. That bot did even better. Not only did it finish fourth, another record, it beat a weighted average of all human-forecaster predictions. It proved itself wiser than the wisdom of a pretty wise crowd.

Mantic’s AI engine is designed to make accurate forecasts in just about any domain. Shevlane wouldn’t show me the engine’s interface, and he was cagey about its precise construction. He described it only as a “scaffolding” that comprises several large language models with different inclinations. These individual LLMs are themselves getting much better at general forecasts, especially those made by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. That’s partly because good forecasting requires reading and processing enormous amounts of information. To guess the winner of the Tour de France, for example, a human forecaster might spend hours building a basic regression model based on previous years’ results, while also scouring injury and conditioning reports and reading commentary from fans and experts. AIs have a natural advantage here. They can read much faster than humans, and their cognitive skills don’t break down after a string of all-nighters.

Last year, a team advised by Haifeng Xu, a professor at the University of Chicago, built a benchmarking service that evaluates AI’s predictions on a continuing basis. Almost every day, it asks the major models new questions pulled from the betting markets on Kalshi. (It recently asked them who Apple’s next CEO would be and also who would star in the upcoming season of The White Lotus.) Their accuracy scores continually update as the questions resolve. “They all have different forecasting personalities,” Xu told me. The version of ChatGPT that the service evaluates is conservative, perhaps too conservative; on Xu’s leaderboard, it currently trails versions of Grok and Gemini.

Mantic’s prediction engine combines a bunch of LLMs and assigns each one different tasks. One might serve as an expert on a database of election results. Another might be asked to scan weather data, economic outcomes, or box-office receipts, depending on the question that it’s attacking. The models work together as a team to generate a final prediction. Shevlane told me that Mantic is using its computing resources to experiment with more complex scaffoldings, which make use of even more models. I asked him whether they have sought AI’s input on the general structure of these scaffoldings. Not yet, he said, but like almost everyone else, they are using it to help write the code for their prediction engines.

A company called Lightning Rod Labs has been experimenting with predictive models that are purpose-built for specific domains. They have even designed one to predict Trump’s erratic behavior. Ben Turtel, the company’s CEO, told me that his team presented to the model a set of more than 2,000 forecasting questions with known outcomes that were not included in its training data. Then the model checked its answers against the things that Trump had actually done, and learned from its mistakes. When the company had the small model forecast Trump’s behavior on a new set of questions—whether he would meet with Xi Jinping in person, for example, or attend the Army-Navy football game—it outperformed OpenAI’s most advanced models.

This year could be big for AI prediction. In January, Mantic entered its most recent souped-up engine into the Metaculus Spring Cup for 2026. It has already been asked how many Oscars Sinners will win and if the United States will soon attack Iran. By May, these questions will resolve, and we will see how the engine fared. If it moves up one spot from its most recent finish, it will become the first AI to medal in a major prediction tournament.

If the AI takes gold, that might signal a new era. Human beings—predictors of eclipses, theorists of cosmic heat death—may no longer be the best guides to the future. From this point on, for as long as we exist, we might be asking AIs what comes next. We won’t always understand how they arrived at their predictions. This crystal ball may be like a black hole with an event horizon, past which the light of its insight cannot escape. We may just have to take it at its word.

So far, elite human forecasters have been pretty good sports about this possibility. When I spoke with Shindel, the highly ranked forecaster, he had nothing but admiring things to say about the AIs. “Their reasoning capabilities are very good,” he told me. “They don’t have the same biases that people have. They can find out about news right as it happens, and they don’t become attached to their predictions.” On Metaculus, a group of forecasters has taken to estimating when AIs will have the chops to out-predict an elite team of humans. Last January, they said there was about a 75 percent chance this would happen by 2030. Now they think it’s more like 95 percent.</div>

            <h2>What Mamdani Doesn’t Know About Tenants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/mamdani-tenant-organizing-affordable-housing/685951/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On New Year’s Day, Zohran Mamdani completed his inauguration festivities and departed for Brooklyn. In the working-class neighborhood of East Flatbush, the new mayor stepped into the lobby of an old apartment building on Clarkson Avenue and met with tenants on rent strike. Their grievances were many: The building has 201 outstanding housing-code violations, including leaks, roach infestations, black mold, and that most perilous of winter derelictions, a lack of consistent heat and hot water.

The young democratic-socialist mayor had championed working-class tenants throughout his campaign, promising to freeze rents in rent-stabilized apartments for four years and even to seize control of buildings owned by slumlords. This trip could be seen as a down payment on his intent.

Mamdani faced reporters and photographers in the lobby. “Landlords have been allowed to mistreat their tenants with impunity,” he declared. “That ends today.” Cea Weaver, the new director of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and, like Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, stood at his side. Her disdain for private-market landlords is no less fierce than Mamdani’s; she has argued that no tenant should be evicted for not paying rent. A few days later, the mayor would announce “rental ripoff hearings” at which tenants could excoriate bad landlords. (A social-media promotion reads like a movie poster: “Mayor Mamdani & the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants Present New Yorkers vs Bad Landlords.”)

Michael Powell: The question-mark mayoralty

As it happens, in the early 1980s, I worked as a tenant organizer in the same neighborhood, including at a building a few doors down from the one where Mamdani spoke. I empathize with the mayor’s fury and recall my own outrage as I spoke with hardworking tenants who ran their ovens with the doors open to stay warm and watched mice scamper across their floors. We confronted bad landlords and ventured into the chaos of housing court in search of justice that often proved elusive.

But over time the problems we were trying to address, and the solutions, began to look more complicated. Rage, I learned, was not enough. In my three years as an organizer, I received a bracing education in the economics of rent-stabilized apartments, the terrible cost that crime wreaks on struggling neighborhoods, and the delicate ecology of low-income housing. All of which shapes my view of Mamdani’s promises: Rent freezes and promises for the city to take over neglected apartment buildings make for good, visceral politics but poor public policy.

I was born and raised in New York City, and grew up in a rent-controlled apartment. My family’s sometimes-straitened finances meant that we would remain renters. I became a tenant organizer in my early 20s, working for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, an offshoot of the city’s Commission on Human Rights. My plan was to change the world, or at least my corner of it.

New York at the time was far more desolate and dilapidated than the expensive, albeit deeply unequal, financial capital it is today. In East Flatbush in the early 1980s, I found blocks of attached brick homes and boulevards with once-grand apartment buildings. But Church Avenue, the commercial spine of the neighborhood, offered a dreary run of boarded-up storefronts, interrupted here and there by diners, real-estate offices, discount shops, and bodegas, where you could score a nickel bag of weed along with your quart of milk. Farther east lay blocks with burnt-out apartment buildings, ghostly at night, and lots strewn with bricks and old bathtubs, mattresses, and cribs. To reach one tenant association I worked with, I had to navigate an open-air heroin market. (I was safe enough; dealers assumed I was just another white boy in need of a fix.)

One night, as I hustled along a deserted avenue to the bus, I passed a row of commercial garages and felt momentarily hopeful: Thank God these businesses remain. Then I heard the high-pitched whine of electric saws behind metal gates, and I realized these were chop shops, where men worked through the night to reduce stolen cars to marketable parts.

The city at that point had shed jobs and residents by the hundreds of thousands. Many white residents in East Flatbush had succumbed to racist fearmongering by real-estate speculators and sold their home for a fraction of the assessed value; the speculators sold those homes to Black buyers at exorbitant interest rates. As new arrivals tried to find their footing, a tide of homicides and drug dealing swept in. In 1976, an influential former local official wrote an essay in The New York Times advising that the city should withdraw services from degraded neighborhoods, even razing apartment blocks, closing subway stations, and leaving land to “lie fallow”; he called it “planned shrinkage.” That did not happen, not exactly, but the neglect was real. The working-class West Indians, Haitians, and African Americans who poured into East Flatbush differed not so much economically from earlier white residents, but they had to fight mightily to obtain the most basic services.

Most tenants I worked with in East Flatbush hailed from the West Indies, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Grenada, and nearly all of them lived in rent-stabilized apartments. One building in particular comes to mind, on Cortelyou Road. The tenants lived in a 1920s-era four-floor walk-up with 25 rent-stabilized units. (Under New York’s rent-stabilization laws, an appointed board sets maximum allowable rent increases citywide.) The landlord, a Jamaican-born insurance salesman, was not a bad guy; at best, he was a couple of steps up the income ladder from his struggling tenants. He had sunk his life savings into the building in hopes of turning a profit, and that was proving a very bad bet.

The old boiler wheezed and stalled, the roof sprang leaks, half-century-old pipes cracked, and the lobby intercom was defunct. The building needed intensive care. But the rent roll was puny, and few tenants could have paid more even if rent stabilization had allowed for it. One evening, the landlord told us that he could not afford to run the building.

Tenant leaders were sympathetic, but this was about survival. They persuaded a housing-court judge to push the landlord aside and appoint an administrator who was empowered to spend rent monies only on heat and emergency repairs. Tougher decisions followed. A young mother of two was well liked but fell months behind on rent; when the city welfare department gave her an emergency cash grant, she declined to use it to pay the rent. A mother of three was romantically entangled with a man who had commandeered a third-floor landing for his drug business and whose clientele sometimes broke into apartments. The tenant association voted to move to evict these women, their decision no less necessary for being sad.

The landlord walked away without a penny. There were no proletarian hearings to denounce a slumlord, who in this case did not really exist. Just deeply painful decisions. But the tenants managed to assure that the building would remain what it is to this day: rent stabilized, still of somewhat-precarious finances. I remember asking a tenant leader what she had prayed for during those tough times. “A good super who understands boilers,” she replied.

East Flatbush is a much healthier place today. New, handsome apartment buildings have gone up, and you can see signs of that mixed blessing known as gentrification. Church Avenue is revived, nearly every storefront occupied, jazz clubs mixing with Haitian bistros, home-loan shops, day-care centers, and Jamaican fish shacks. But the neighborhood still feels fragile, acutely sensitive to any uptick in crime and any drop-off in city services.

The multifamily-housing stock in East Flatbush remains particularly vulnerable, as it does in all but the wealthiest of the city’s neighborhoods. (New York has 1 million rent-stabilized apartments.) Today, even many well-run rent-stabilized buildings are still only marginally profitable. That is in part because of rent-law changes pushed through the state legislature in 2019, and advocated by Weaver. These changes include laudable protections for tenants, but the economic effects are more uncertain. Previously, when a tenant moved out of a stabilized apartment, the landlord could raise the rent by 20 percent. Landlords were also allowed to substantially increase rents if they rehabilitated an apartment or made major improvements to a building. Under the new law, they can raise rents by only minuscule amounts to cover rehabilitation costs. One need not weep for landlords—some of whom have prospered mightily—to note they no longer have much incentive to fix up apartments.

Rogé Karma: Mamdani has a point about rent control

Meanwhile, operating costs are rising faster than rental revenues, according to the NYU Furman Center, which recently examined rent-stabilized housing. And rent collections in many working-class buildings in New York never fully rebounded after COVID. The result, predictably, is disinvestment: As managers have cut back on maintenance, the number of code violations has spiked—a 47 percent increase in the past five years in the rent-stabilized buildings that NYU examined. A study by Enterprise Community Partners, an organization that supports affordable housing, found that costs for affordable-housing operators—including insurance, maintenance, and administrative expenses—jumped 40 percent from 2017 to 2024; six of every 10 projects the group has financed are losing money. All of this is risky business for those who operate buildings that are 80 to 100 years old. These problems extend as well to rent-stabilized buildings run by respected nonprofits.

Even the Mamdani administration has acknowledged the near-impossible economics of rent-stabilized housing. After the mayor visited the building on Clarkson Avenue, the city’s law department sued to delay the sale of the building and 92 others owned by the same landlord in a bankruptcy auction; the landlord, the Pinnacle Group, owed the city $12.7 million in arrears and fines. The city wanted to sideline the leading bidder, and was trying to buy time, likely so it could steer the portfolio to a more tenant-friendly buyer, or even the city itself.

I have no quibble with targeting the Pinnacle Group, which is in bankruptcy proceedings on 93 buildings with 5,150 apartments, most of which are rent stabilized; these buildings have a cumulative 5,000 code violations and 14,000 complaints. But in court documents, the city’s lawyers pointed out that rents in Pinnacle’s portfolio are “very low averaging” and that those revenues are too low to constitute a “supportable business.” That is surely an obstacle to clearing up code violations. A federal bankruptcy judge denied the city’s motion, ruling that the new proposed buyer had submitted a “reasonable-sounding plan” to manage the buildings—potentially saving the city from a very expensive rehabilitation project.

All of this underlines why fixing the problem of affordable housing in New York City is not so simple as freezing rents. Mamdani’s deputy mayor for housing and planning recently said that the administration wants to lower costs for landlords—for example, through property-tax reform, tax breaks for renovating apartments, and attempts to slow the steep rise in building-insurance costs. The mayor’s primary focus, however, is on what tenants pay to live in this terrifically expensive city and the quality of their housing. That’s far from irrelevant. But the question of how to get landlords to deliver this housing without bankrupting their buildings matters just as much.

There was also, for me as an organizer, the issue of crime. Five years ago, Mamdani argued that the New York Police Department was essentially evil and should have its budget deeply slashed. He has softened that view considerably since taking office, but many DSA comrades still hold it. I can speak only to my own experience: Nothing so erodes the stability of neighborhoods and buildings as failing to address crime.

I felt its pernicious effects personally in East Flatbush. Tenants had formed an association at a building on Martense Street, at a then-sketchy corner. The building had many ailments, and the landlord seemed intent on doing as little as possible about them. Tenants identified their greatest need as a working intercom. Absent that, the front door swung ajar, a welcome sign to thieves. One afternoon, I walked downstairs after talking with the tenant leaders and found five adolescent boys jiggering locks to break into an apartment.

Yo, yo, yo, get out of here, I said loudly, waving my hands to scat.

The littlest boy pulled out a strikingly large gun and stuck it in my face. Shoot him, two boys yelled. Nah, leave the motherfucker alone, the other two said. The boy considered his options, then tucked the gun back into his waistband. He told me I was lucky to be alive. I nodded in agreement.

Henry Grabar: The great crime decline is happening all across the country

Such episodes threatened civic life in a most elemental fashion. A homeowner block leader who risked catching a stray bullet was far less likely to walk to an evening meeting at a local church. Tenants told me they worried that if they talked openly in their lobby about crime, snitches for local drug dealers might overhear and report them. Other tenants sometimes insisted on walking me to the subway after a meeting, placing themselves in harm’s way.

I never once heard a tenant leader or block leader argue for less policing. They wanted a respectful partnership with law enforcement. At great risk, they monitored dangerous streets and rowhouses, took notes on dealers and gangs, and passed this information along to the local precincts and to the mayor’s office. Some cops and city officials were unresponsive, even corrupt. But the best listened carefully and used that information to clear notorious corners and round up gang leaders.

I once stood watch with tenants every night for a week after we heard that their landlord had hired an arsonist—known as a “torch”—to burn down their building, so the landlord could collect the insurance money. The city’s Arson Strike Force got involved, and the building stands to this day.

The new mayor is fond of his On the Waterfront rhetoric, and tends to suggest that, before the socialists came to power, city government was dismissive of the poor and working class. He means well, but this is nonsense. Thankfully, city officials—prodded by tenants and small-business owners, clergy and homeowners, and, yes, some landlords—rejected advice to consign neighborhoods such as East Flatbush to history’s dustbin. Beginning in the 1980s, successive mayors, Democrats and Republicans, invested first hundreds of millions and then billions of dollars in what became the greatest urban-rebuilding program in American history. The city and nonprofits rehabilitated abandoned buildings and constructed new ones, along with day cares and schools. The rubble-strewn lots I once walked through are now smart-looking apartment buildings. Banks and supermarkets sit on corners where drug dealers held sway. Citywide, many fewer children are in foster care, fewer men are in prison, and far fewer New Yorkers are murdered each year.

I took a walk recently through East Flatbush, alongside the snow-laden Holy Cross Cemetery, down Church Avenue, and along a couple of boulevards of prewar apartment buildings, as achingly beautiful and, in some cases, as tattered as when I first arrived there. The city still faces many challenges, but its recent history gives me hope that a new mayor and administration committed to improving affordable housing can make a profound mark. To do that, Mamdani will need to toss aside easy moral binaries—noble tenants versus capitalist landlords, frozen rents versus runaway profits—and recognize the painful trade-offs that will come with restoring rent-stabilized housing, one of New York’s great resources.</div>

Pioneer sold off their division months ago to a company that just wanted the patents. I am fairly sure LG and ASUS also stopped. The folks who use makemkv have been buying up the last drives that can handle UHD discs (native or with a firmware mod).

The standalone blu ray player market has a shrinking set of model options and also no new 4k options for the last few years.

Large scale storage is getting so cheap keeping ones movies or any other data on hard drives is very affordable and makes whatever is being stored much more immediately on hand then when it is on a disk. I got a 26tb HDD for about $10 a terabyte a few months ago, that&#39;s a lot of space for movies or anything else.

Audio formats seem to have a thriving nostalgia market where vinyl, CDs and even cassettes have seen a resurgence of both new players and new media being produced.  I guess there is no equivalent in the video market.

No. Why would it if it&#39;s not actually saving the conversation?

If your argument is &quot;But it&#39;s being stored temporarily in the system so that the transcription bot can do stuff&quot;, do you think that the phone network still works by connecting people directly via an electrical wire? The moment phone companies switched to packet switching some kind of temporary storage became normal. No courts ever intervened and had then done so they&#39;d have sided with the phone compani

Yes, T-Mobile is openly admitting that their network is computerized and computers process the packets that get sent to and from phones.

You know. Like all phone systems have worked since the 2000s.

Or do you think this technology requires actual human translators to be translating the conversations? Because if you think that you seriously misread the summary.

That&#39;s what happened when they gave my uncle ivermectin to treat COVID. He died that night. They need to ban ivermectin and sue the doctors that prescribed it.

What he is mocking is bullshit, and it should be mocked. And so should cowards.

Think that&#39;s bad, I ended up with Gavino&#39;s head!

I remember seeing a multi-part documentary about that guy.

Such a pity modern medicine gave you a chance to survive, without it we&#39;d be without you and with an improved gene pool.

Cool story, bro. But you need to work on the lie. A death the next day is not even remotely credible. Just claim he dies a week later. You may also want to replace &quot;heart strain&quot; with something else, because if you actually get that from one shot (which is very, very rare), you will NOT get a second one.

True. And likely, the people he tries to get with that nonsense would not even notice.

Did you write that will eating McDonalds and sucking on a Zyn pouch?

Was your uncle hit by a bus? Because this really begs for the kind of a punchline.

My grandfather died the day after I set up snapshotting on my filesystem.  Never again will I set up snapshotting on my filesystem.

I had a stroke several weeks after an mRNA vaccine (not kidding). Of course, my high blood pressure, high cholesterol and inactivity couldn&#39;t be factors. Nope, it was the mRNA.

To make this still a success. Irrationality is not everywhere in power. And a better flu shot is overdue.

Mexico, please provide medical assistance to US. at least to its citizens who long for the days when we believed in science.

The gates foundation, which is no longer the bill and Melinda Gates foundation since she had her name taken off of it for Bill-gave-her-an-STD-from-Epstein-Island (or perhaps ranch) reasons, is very effective at making Bill Gates rich again. And isn&#39;t that what philanthropy is all about?

It&#39;s not about paying for the commercialization. It&#39;s about making a huge profit by selling in the US.

Americans are 5% of the worlds population but pay for 75% of the commercialization of new drugs and procedures.

Americans are 15% of the world&#39;s GDP and account for 64-78% of pharmaceutical profits   [maplevalleyrx.com].  The US has about 75% of pharmaceutical venture capital as well, but again it&#39;s wrong to equate venture capital with &quot;commercialization of new drugs and procedures&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot of VC simply because the US healthcare system is so extractive; that doesn&#39;t give you a distinction between people doing useful stuf

Anti-Vax attitudes have gotten people killed

Excessive &quot;group-think&quot; type stupidity always gets people killed. The sad fact is that these are often not part of the stupid. We have way too many malicious people in the human race.

It also matters to babies who have brain-dead parents who will gladly expose them to measles, polio, etc. just so they can remain pure anti-vaxxers. And to teenagers with respect to the HPV vaccine, there the problem is the anti-vaxxers and the Christian nutjobs; the latter think that if their kid gets the HPV vaccine, they will turn into sex-crazed maniacs. They figure if kids are scared of HPV, then they stop screwing. Hint: it won&#39;t.

Look at his (?) other posts, he/she/it is serious.

The biggest lie in your post is when you said you could read.

No. You were banned from spreading lies. There is a difference, even if you are clearly far too deep in delusion to be able to understand that. Or you are just a fundamentally corrupt and deeply malicious person. Would not rule that out.

&quot;pureblood&quot; So, you support Voldemort? Also, all your food has been genetically modified. What do you think selective breeding is?

You: Doctor, Doctor, help me, I cannot stop dancing.

Doctor: Hmmm.....I see. You have Watusi disease.

Doctor: Yup, I have a mRNA vaccine for that.

You: Doctor, Doctor, I won&#39;t take no stinking mRNA vaccine. I only want a real vaccine.

Doctor: mRNA is a real vaccine, we&#39;ve been testing it since Bush Jr. started funding it, although it had prior fun

Selective breeding is not GMO/vice versa because GMO techniques allow ends which cannot occur in nature, and also because we create these modified organisms and then ensure their success with external means — where if nature somehow did somehow impossibly produce them, they would vanish again anyway because they are designed for conditions which do not exist naturally.

We&#39;ll spend a century claiming we are Canadian when we travel abroad. At least we got practice under &quot;Ireq&quot; Bush.

And it seems we have these to avoid.https://www.dailykos.com/stori... [dailykos.com]

And in actual reality, no actual expert ever claimed it would &quot;prevent&quot; the spreading. Because that is not how things work. It is about slowing things down and reducing the death toll, and not just by a bit.

You are a clueless asshole. Please shut up before you get more people killed.

First, phase 3 studies are by definition not safety studies, but efficacy studies on a large number of test subjects. Safety studies are phase 1.

Second, ethics guidelines stipulate that you must provide state of the art care for those subjects which do not get the new vaccine, with very tight exceptions. For flu shots, it means that everyone gets a shot, either with a traditional vaccine or the new one, since it is universally accepted outside the new FDA that a classical shot is better than placebo.

And of course you can compare the outcomes. Comparing the new vaccine to an established one wrt efficacy and side effects is actually more informative than comparing against placebo.

It isn&#39;t forestry that we want the cabinetmaker to learn, it is that we don&#39;t want them to stack their errors.

Imagine if the cabinetmaker made the first cabinet they built against the blueprints, but then they built each successive cabinet against the previous one instead of the blueprint.  With each generation, the errors stack up and before long, your cabinets look like something Dr. Seuss would draw.

How badly have the errors stacked up in this case?  We have no idea.  We haven&#39;t done actual placebo trial

Imagine the headlines if Obama appointed a longtime heroin junkie to run the FDA. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/h... [pbs.org]

Moderna just need to make a larger &quot;facilitation payment&quot;. The anti-vax thing is just a way for them to extract a bit more money from the pharma industry.

While that&#39;s probably true for Trump ...  For JFK Jr and the bulk of anti-vaxers, not so much.  They really seem to believe everything they&#39;re fed through their &quot;trusted&quot; channels.  And they think everyone else are the brainwashed ... by that science bogeyman.

There&#39;s no way to know what RFK Jr actually thinks. Believing that anything he says has any relation to his personal beliefs is naive at best.

What makes this flu vaccine bad but the dozens of vaccines you&#39;ve received over the years good? Is it scary mRNA? That was discovered in the 1960s and has been researched ever since. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/a... [nih.gov]

This is by far the easiest.  One goes to an age clearinghouse, get a certification so they can link an account, even if it is their troll shit-post account... who cares... it just shows that the account is over 18.

However... dataz.  Being able to sell to age groups is a big thing, because kids buy a lot of stuff, especially at the vulnerable times where imprinting them with needing to buy items or wear products in order to be accepted into daily society is a must.  Everyone wants that age data, either to se

Plus nitro. They&#39;ve been mad at pushing nitro everywhere. Makes you want to vomit every time you see it.

Most countries that introduced age verification requirements state that verification must be &quot;highly effective&quot;. Would this predictive profiling be enough in the court of law?

It&#39;s probably stuff like the age of the account. If it&#39;s 10 years old, the chance that the owner is under 13 and registered it as a toddler is quite small. If they have made purchases with a credit card, or linked a phone number to it, that sort of thing.

We&#39;ve covered the accuracy of predictive profiling time and time again. The amount of insight you can gain from someone&#39;s behaviour is truly immense. Remember the case of Target being criticised for sending pregnancy related products to a teen girl based purely on purchasing behaviour, only for it later to come out that she was pregnant despite her not telling anyone?

i am not a discord user, does discord monitor the app usage/conversations are not private? i thought the servers were private enclaves without giving access to discord the company?

If I remember correctly, the pregnancy thing went further. She didn&#39;t even know she was pregnant yet. The system just flagged her behavioral changes as associated with pregnancy.

Because most of our behavioral patterns never reach conscious mind. They&#39;re decided on a different cognitive level. Our awareness of ourselves is quite low for evolutionary reasons.

... than yet another glorified and way overrated IRC/XChat clone like Slack or other candidates - will only take me a few minutes. As soon as they get more annoying than convenient I&#39;m out. For all I care they might as well just go broke already, since they&#39;re still not profitable. No need to try to gain any mass by starting this uber-surveillance thing. It won&#39;t pan out anyway, so they might aswell just give up.

It&#39;s easy to replace Discord if no one wants to talk to yoiu.

Besides sibling comments&#39; objections, I don&#39;t know literally anyone who uses Discord on purpose. People use it because they have to in order to get support with a product or service, because it&#39;s where their gaming clan meets, etc.

My daughter plays Roblox. They are asking her to take a selfie to get assigned to an age group.

https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/... [roblox.com]

Seriously, they are planning to use some AI doodad to place you into a group &quot;Your estimated age helps place you in the appropriate age group (5-8, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, and 21+) to customize your experience on Roblox&quot;. I&#39;ve known people that have baby faces in their 30&#39;s, and I&#39;ve seen preteens that have started showing off beard. And this is all based on some image recognition thingamajick?

Most countries at least in EU have some sort of governmental identity mechanism, that allows you to make strong identification to any service. Why does this have to be some sort of AI magic that steals your data, when this all could be handled by a simple federated identity tokens. Just go to your government site, ask it to generate a signed token that states &quot;On this day, holder of this token is X years of age&quot;, lifetime of token can be like 15 minutes. No need for government to learn what were you visiting and no need for the service to know all other details either.

They are already utilizing some third party to do the selfie recognition and evaluation, why couldn&#39;t the same third party pass a token between gov website and the service with the same price?

No method (regardless how clever) and solve the root problem: A child can ask its 18 year old friend to unlock the account.You can find ways to prove age, but there are no reasonable ways to prove the current user is the person who proved to be 18+

That means, at least in Europe, they are not legally allowed to do any storage and they must keep the data local or being in direct, non-accidental violation of the GDPR. Fines go up to 5% of annual global (!) turnover and, for repeat offenders, a prohibition to process or store any personal data.

Now, I have zero trust in their integrity or honor. But people will be looking and exfiltrating that video data or storing it

They already had a leak of data they were supposed to have deleted. I wouldn&#39;t trust them.

Now every user needs to think about if they behave like an underage user.Better not login at times pupils have free time. Login early on holiday days to prove that you&#39;re not a child sleeping long at the day off. Make sure not to click like on silly memes. Join some servers that look boring to kids.That&#39;s just another way to make users self-censor.

You know, when you put it like that I realize Discord might be massively improved if users are given incentive not to act like they&#39;re underage and immature.

You just ask for age verification. At that time, if they find you to not be underage, they do not ask again. As reverse ageing is not a thing, that makes sense.

According to reddit, users are approaching this by:

why the fuck doesn&#39;t someone pursue criminal charges of neglect against parents for allowing their children unsupervised access to a known dangerous place (i.e., the internet).

Their damned kids would be safe if they were properly supervised.

What? Fall for actually looking after their children? Fall for supervising their activities when on the internet? Fall for looking out for their safety?

I&#39;m saying parents need to supervise their children on the internet.

Apparently, you&#39;re firmly in Epstein&#39;s camp. Fucking pedo.

We went from privacy consciousness and being scared of government bugs planted everywhere to giving ALL our information away for practically free AND running as many bugs and cameras in and around our houses, voluntarily.

IM needs to become a fully P2P (and non-proprietary) thing, so that there is no central authority (other than maybe DNS itself) to be coerced. Of course, that brings up NAT problems so that laymen are going to have connectivity problems, and a lack of any sort of commercial advertising and other pressures to get people to come over. (And I&#39;m casually glossing over other problems, such as authentication.) No wonder it hasn&#39;t taken off yet.

But if we can get there, the holy grail is a lack of any particular pa

..are always a bit unevenIt takes a while for stability to mature

Yeah, I guess, it is a bit uneven and unstable if it leaves you free time.

The even and stable implementation when it arrives will work like that ole Matrix, you&#39;ll be born plugged in and working overtime while receiving false dreams to keep you happy - until you&#39;re worn off and they flush you out.

The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.LOL.  That&#39;s not how it works.  No company is going to pay you to work less (without a significan reduction in pay).
 
Companies are chasing AI for one reason and one reason only.  They dream of a glorious utopian future where there are no employees and all the money flows directly into the pockets a few top executives.

Dunno about the article, but I&#39;ve seen the &quot;tools&quot; and it is as if they are hand-coded by imbeciles who have never done more than hobbyist coding. The so-called &quot;agentic architecture&quot; is just moronic, as if a drunk freshman vibe-vomited right after the final exams for the fall session.

It is as if all knowledge of client-server architectures was lost and the teenagers that play with this shit have to reinvent the wheel and the bicycle again.

But we know why everyone needs 500 datacenters powered by 50 nuclear

I think the idea that people are going to replace real client server software with this stuff is off base.  What it is actually great for is automating shorter lived process.

Hey can we just collect this data and maybe separate it in to useful fields like in a sharepoint list or something and when the developers get a real ERP module completed we can import the data. Better yet lets figure out what the process looks like with this stuff then create proper software to support after we know what the real world

I just found out the most interesting thing I can do with copilot at work: turn it off. In VS code, the bottom right copilot button has a &quot;snooze&quot; option. I use it because inserted garbage comments break my train of thought.

I don&#39;t say it&#39;s not useful. But it does drive me nuts sometimes.

has been utter shit for decades. It glorifies overtime over everything else - including over metrics that could be improved with less overtime, such as quality and efficiency.

AI is just more of the same: turbocharged shit.

I&#39;m saying this as an American expat living in Europe and actually having a quality of life and work/life balance I never had stateside.

Itâ(TM)s not privilegeâ¦itâ(TM)s a choice that requires effort and work to unlock. Itâ(TM)s a lot easier than most people think.

In summary, you struck it rich, so can live with the eliteIt&#39;s very telling that you think someone who relocated to Europe &quot;struck it rich&quot; and &quot;lives with the elite&quot;: it show how much of a dump you think America is in comparison.

It&#39;s very telling that you think someone who relocated to Europe &quot;struck it rich&quot; and &quot;lives with the elite&quot;: it show how much of a dump you think America is in comparison.

Disclaimer: former US American citizen turned European here

The system and culture in the US is pretty broken in key parts, that&#39;s for sure. Europe is aging and has a demographic bomb coming up, but by and large quality of living is higher by default these days. Healthcare, safety nets and a (somewhat) sane system of taxation are all part of this. I hope any US revolution that might be upcoming will be peaceful and that some basics will be factory-reset to some saner defaults.

Be thanked for being more productive by getting more tasks. Then wonder why you burn out, when you do 100 things fast instead of 10 slow.

Echos of this have been around in the past.  The computer allowed people to get a lot more done, so they spent more time on it.  Same with the Internet.  When you have a tool that is a force multiplier, you want to hit the gas on it and see what it can do.

This is normal.  In the past, force multipliers for me have been getting a central Git system in place, a central documentation system, a ticket system, from there working with reports.  AI helps accelerate that even more.

So they&#39;re rediscovering what any artist who create for a living has learned - you can&#39;t produce good work all the time by the hour.

... Chillout time. No joke. My productivity has gone 5x in the last 6 months, especially with the newest models and them spitting out boring but maintainable boilerplate code for me and explaining the details of what they&#39;re doing, but overall my life has become more chill. I&#39;ve started taking naps at noon when I&#39;m in homeoffice.

Then again, I&#39;m an experienced senior webdev, the new product we&#39;re building has is architecture 100% designed and maintained by me alone and with AI I basically have a team 5 junio

That&#39;s the point, but not always what they achieve. Abstractions are always well intended but rarely well done.

The news has been filled with articles about companies proclaiming how they are going all in on AI.I wonder how long until we see the first articles about companies proclaiming they are ditching AI and the benefits / competitive advantage they seek to reap from doing so?

I work the same hours. I just have one more tool in the toolbox.

Sounds like a case where one could accurately say &quot;you&#39;re holding it wrong&quot; ...

A corporation is not physically capable of appreciating you.

You exist to be used and discarded. There&#39;s another one like you waiting for a job.

Ever since the rise of Silicon Valley, programmers developed a Workaholic attitude.   People quickly realized that the normal every day workers got nowhere, while those that put in the hard work often ended up as C level employees at huge firms - or started their own firm and become the CEO and Founder.  This mainly was a reflection of the fact that you absolutely need good ideas to create a new business, it still needs a TON of scut work to actually make a new business successful.

I would rather have more people on my team so that I can take a vacation instead of multiplying my work or becoming indispensable. (I don&#39;t believe any employee is actually indispensable, basically you need to be chair of the board because even CEOs get fired)

Okay Donny, you can have it.&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, the US bases would probably in uninhabited regions of Iceland anyways. He&#39;ll just get it cheaper after AMOC collapse.

Doesn&#39;t matter, the US bases would probably in uninhabited regions of Iceland anyways. He&#39;ll just get it cheaper after AMOC collapse.

There&#39;s already a NATO base here, at Keflavík (conjoining the international airport). It was abandoned in 2006 but it&#39;s been moving toward increased usage.  That would surely be the primary base if the US invaded us.

I take talk of potential US invasions of us deadly seriously.  Defending Greenland against European counters - and in general excluding European control of the North Atlantic as a whole - would be vastly easier if the US captured Iceland. Maintaining a major airbase in Iceland is *far* easi

I don&#39;t think la Presidenta thinks that far ahead. And there&#39;s little chance of piping Iceland&#39;s geothermal energy to Greenland. It would make more sense to ship the crap to Iceland and refine it there. So that asshole has to invade two islands.

la Presidenta also hasn&#39;t figured out Greenland is covered in ice, lots of it. He sees the word &quot;Greenland&quot; and is imagining a tropical paradise. Any mineral recovery would be expensive and very damaging to the environment. Of course, he might go for it just for the

I don&#39;t think la Presidenta thinks that far ahead.

It&#39;s not about what he thinks, it&#39;s about what his advisors think.

For a long time, he consistently referred to Greenland as Greenland.  Then suddenly, in a press conference out of the blue, he kept calling it Iceland.  Lead theory in the press here is that some of his advisors were discussing Iceland during a meeting about Greenland, and thus caused his confusion.

And there&#39;s little chance of piping Iceland&#39;s geothermal energy to Greenland.

Ah, would that be Greenland you&#39;re thinking of?

Trump did mix up Greenland and Iceland multiple times. If you believe Biden should have been tested before running again, you should agree Donald needs public tests. Their symptoms might be different, but Donald is discombobulated way too often.

My take on this story is that Iceland is predicted to be less of a green land, whereas Greenland is probably going to be even more of an ice land.

Even if their island becomes 100% hostile to all life, the Icelanders can always power artificial life with the free energy they&#39;re blessed with: the uninterrupted source of heat coming from the bowels of the Earth.

They&#39;re in a quasi-unique position of not really having to worry about climate change, if worse comes to worst.

Right. Meanwhile down in the tropics they could just use the free energy from the sun to power the A/C if the heat becomes too extreme.

Were you born this stupid or do you have to practice at it?

Right. Meanwhile down in the tropics they could just use the free energy from the sun to power the A/C if the heat becomes too extreme.Because people just love being inside all the time.

It depends on how fast it happens.  Our buildings are not built for temperatures that low.  A typical January day has a high just above freezing and a low just below it.

If change happens at the same sort of speed that housing is replaced / new infrastructure is built, yes, we can adapt.  But I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;re supposed to bear the cost of renovating every building in the country at once and dramatically expanding our energy production, if it were to happen quickly. There&#39;s also what it would do to our e

I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;d have at least a decade before things got THAT extreme.  Urgent planning needed, but the construction should be doable.  Food seems a more difficult problem.  Also, most geothermal plants have a relatively short lifetime.  (I&#39;m not sure about the ones based around volcanoes.  I don&#39;t think those have a track record.)

Global warming is going to make things colder?In some areas, yes.  Global warming will destabilize existing wind, weather, and ocean currents into new patterns.  Some places will loose their current heating and cooling sources.Drain the Chesapeake Bay and see what happens to the weather around Washington DC and Baltimore.  Drain Puget Sound and see what happens to Seattle.  Flowing ocean water can have a stabilizing effect on the land area near them.Stop the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the warm water that keeps Iceland temperate will stop and no longer be a stabilizing source.  Iceland would get colder and the AMOC current would turn to new locations.  There are several models that show the best guess of what would happen but suffice it to say it would change weather patterns for numerous locations.

There are several models that show the best guess of what would happen but suffice it to say it would change weather patterns for numerous locations.

_And_ other places will get hotter, as less heat is transported away by the AMOC. So those places may become uninhabitable by being so hot and humid that humans will just overheat and die from heat stroke.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to shut down the thermal conveying outside of the North Atlantic.  The AMOC is just a part of a much larger system.  But my *guess* is much of the heat would end up in Antarctica rather than the North Atlantic.  Europe would get extremely cold, and Antarctica would melt faster than predicted.  (Once upon a time there were forests in Antarctica.  Of course, the other continents have moved since then.)

Those much larger systems aren&#39;t magic, they have causes which are being perturbed.

Look for the conveyor to shut down since it&#39;s powered by sea ice.

... northern Europe and the northern Atlantic in the unique position of becoming the earths new coldest point on earth. Iceland would be affected, as would Scandinavia, Germany and some other regions. Given that Germany enjoys a relatively moderate climate considering its latitude position on the globe these assumptions are plausible. If the gulf stream goes away, Germany will get colder.

As mentioned, that is pretty unique, globally speaking.

Global warming is going to make things colder?Yes, potentially. The effects of global warming on AMOC and the consequences have been explored in the scientific literature since the 1970s.

Yes, potentially. The effects of global warming on AMOC and the consequences have been explored in the scientific literature since the 1970s.

A country looks into the future and sees something bleak. Then they begin to plan for it.

Imagine how stupid they would be if they just denied it, turned a blind eye, and then actively attempted to accelerate directly toward it.

I mean, to be fair, Denmark nearly did order Iceland evacuated during the Mist Hardships after the eruption of Laki.

We tend not to get &quot;geologically-catastrophic&quot; eruptions here like, say, Yellowstone.  But we get &quot;historically-catastrophic&quot; eruptions surprisingly often, once every 100-200 years or so.  For example, the largest lava flow on Earth in the entire Holocene is in Iceland, the jórsárhraun, from Bárðarbunga.

Take Laki for example.  A 25 kilometer long fissure &quot;unzipped&quot;. Lava fountains peaked at 800-1400m high. The  eruption lasted for 9 months. The worst problem was the gas. To give some perspective: Pinatubo was the gassiest eruption of the 20th century, emitting a very high ~20 MT of sulfur dioxide (Mount Saint Helens by contrast was only ~1,5MT).  Well, Laki emitted *120 MT* of sulfur dioxide.  And 8-15MT of hydrogen fluoride, which is vastly worse.  Normally polar volcanoes have little impact on global climate (volcanic climate impacts tend to be strongest poleward of the volcano), but Laki was so intense that the Mississippi River froze at New Orleans and there was ice in the Gulf of Mexico.  It disrupted rain cycles around the world and caused famines that killed millions (Egypt suffered particularly badly).  Tens of thousands of deaths were reported directly from the gas in the UK (one presumes the sick and elderly who are vulnerable to air pollution).  Weak harvests and the poor government response to it aggravated tensions in France, and probably contributed to the French Revolution five years later.

Regarding the latter... it&#39;s funny how things can come full circle.  Because the French Revolution ultimately led to Napoleon, and thus the Napoleonic Wars, which led to Denmark losing Norway to Sweden, which led to Denmark clamping down on its remaining colonies (including Iceland), which created the local anger in Iceland that led to the Icelandic independence movement that ultimately led to Iceland&#39;s freedom.

But Laki is hardly the only one.  Another good example is Hekla.  If you look at old maps of Iceland, they commonly draw Hekla hugely prominently, erupting, using the scariest drawing style they can.  Hekla became quite famous in the Middle Ages in Europe as being the entrance to Hell. It was written as being the prison of Judas, people claimed to see souls flying into it during an eruption, etc.  It seems to have gotten its fame during the 1104 eruption, which dusted Europe with ash.

Vikings.  Iron age technology.  They didn&#39;t even have chimneys in their halls.  And yet, they built a nation in that cold.

Yeah, that was a poor analogy.  It&#39;s more like &quot;since the last ice age&quot;.  If the AMOC collapses, expect Iceland to become completely surrounded by sea ice, without gaps.  It&#39;ll take awhile, but that&#39;s what to expect.  (But you probably won&#39;t be able to ski from Iceland to Greenland.)

OTOH, expect this to eventually cause the Bering Strait to freeze solid.  (I said &quot;eventually&quot;.  This would take awhile.)  Also the US east coast would get a lot colder, though nothing like Europe.  There&#39;s no really good histor

Uninhabitable! That&#39;s ridiculous, there are people living up above the artic circle. If the current moves is likely that lifestyle will change and become more like the artic. I call this climate alarmism.

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Telcos likely received advance warning about January&#39;s critical Telnet vulnerability before its public disclosure, according to threat intelligence biz GreyNoise.

Global Telnet traffic &quot;fell off a cliff&quot; on January 14, six days before security advisories for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. The flaw, a decade-old bug in GNU InetUtils telnetd with a 9.8 CVSS score, allows trivial root access exploitation.

GreyNoise data shows Telnet sessions dropped 65 percent within one hour on January 14, then 83 percent within two hours. Daily sessions fell from an average 914,000 (December 1 to January 14) to around 373,000, equating to a 59 percent decrease that persists today.

&quot;That kind of step function – propagating within a single hour window – reads as a configuration change on routing infrastructure, not behavioral drift in scanning populations,&quot; said GreyNoise&#39;s Bob Rudis and &quot;Orbie,&quot; in a recent blog.

The researchers unverified theory is that infrastructure operators may have received information about the make-me-root flaw before advisories went to the masses.

&quot;A backbone or transit provider – possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment– implemented port 23 filtering on transit links. The filtering went live on January 14. The public disclosure followed on January 20.&quot;

As for supporting evidence? 18 operators, including BT, Cox Communications, and Vultr went from hundreds of thousands of Telnet sessions to zero by January 15.

Major cloud providers were mostly unaffected by this drop off, and in some cases like AWS, increased by 78 percent.

&quot;Cloud providers have extensive private peering at major IXPs that bypass traditional transit backbone paths. Residential and enterprise ISPs typically don&#39;t,&quot; the researchers said.

All of this points to one or more Tier 1 transit providers in North America implementing port 23 filtering. US residential ISP Telnet traffic dropped within the US maintenance window hours, and the same occurred at those relying on transatlantic or transpacific backbone routes, all while European peering was relatively unaffected, they added.

While GreyNoise acknowledged that correlation does not equal causation, its experts said a pre-advisory notification could explain the timing between traffic drop off and advisory releases, the specific port 23 filtering, and the fact that the filter is still in place today.

&quot;We can&#39;t prove this. The backbone drop could be entirely coincidental – ISPs have been slowly moving toward filtering legacy insecure protocols for years (Wannacry), and January 14 could simply have been when someone&#39;s change control ticket finally got executed.

&quot;But the combination of a Tier 1 backbone implementing what appears to be port 23 filtering, followed six days later by the disclosure of a trivially exploitable root-access telnet vulnerability, followed four days after that by a CISA KEV listing, is worth documenting and considering.&quot;

The Register approached some of the telcos GreyNoise mentioned in its report for their take on the theory and we&#39;ll update this article if we hear back. ®

            <h2>Brussels drafts blueprint to spot and swat rogue drones</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/eu_drone_action_plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission wants to see stronger EU-wide cooperation over malicious drones via a new action plan. Proposals include a central counter-drone test facility, changing the current rules governing civilian use, and a development boost to Europe&#39;s own drones and counter-drone systems.

While EU countries suffer nothing like the constant drone attacks that Russia mounts against Ukraine, they are a stark reminder of the danger. Last year, drone incursions caused airport shutdowns in Oslo and Copenhagen, and it was suspected these came from Russia-owned ships passing through the strait between the two countries.

In response, the EC is unveiling its EU Action Plan aimed at countering the increasing threat to EU states from remotely operated aircraft.

This is described as an ambitious blueprint for stronger EU cooperation and solidarity, aimed at boosting detection capability, coordinating responses, and strengthening the region&#39;s defense readiness.

The EC&#39;s report notes that drones are evolving rapidly, with advances in speed, range, and payload, plus other aspects such as resistance to electronic countermeasures. Anti-drone systems must therefore keep pace with these developments.

The Commission proposes a new framework to boost development and production of drones and counter-drone systems. It says it will work with member states to define priorities regarding technologies and capacities to inform investment.

It also calls for new approaches to testing to move solutions from the lab to deployment faster. The EU will aim to build a network of multinational testing and expertise centers for drones across member states, and asks the latter to remove any obstacles that might prevent drone and counter-drone technologies being tested in specifically designated areas.

But perhaps most importantly, building these systems at scale will be key. The Commission says it aims to expand industry engagement by convening a drone and counter-drone Industrial Forum, building on the Drone Alliance initiative with Ukraine.

It also says it will assess the possibility of co-opting the forthcoming Industrial Accelerator Act, due for proposal later this month, and the European Defence Industry Programme to boost EU production of drone and counter-drone kit.

Existing rules on civilian use will be adapted to reflect new security realities, according to the EC. These will be addressed via a proposed Drone Security Package that will extend registration and identification requirements to all drones above 100 g (about 4 oz). It hopes to have this ready for approval by Q3 2026.

It will also support a more active implementation of U-space services, a European digital system developed to manage safe access to airspace for remotely operated systems. The EC also envisions an &quot;EU Trusted Drone&quot; scheme to identify secure equipment on the market.

The EU says it has already put in place a Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive, requiring member nations to have a national resilience strategy and conduct risk assessments on disruptive incidents. Now it wants to go further and is proposing stress tests to gauge the resilience of critical infrastructure against drone intrusion – if countries are willing, of course.

As for detecting and tracking drones, the EC says that Europe needs better situational awareness. This will mean integrating relevant data from existing sources into a single view. Based on frameworks such as U-space, it ought to be possible to establish systems to detect, track, and identify in near real time all legitimate drones.

The region&#39;s telecoms networks can also play a part, detecting 5G-connected drones by identifying unusual SIM card identities, types of data transmission or activities, the report states. Networks should provide alerts on fast-moving assets, perhaps using AI-based automated detection and alert systems. However, this method of detection would rely on a strong partnership between national authorities,and telecoms operators, the EC says.

But 5G networks can also detect non-connected drones by using cell stations as if they were radar sensors, able to locate flying objects, including balloons, it claims. In the short term, this could be deployed to monitor certain locations such as critical infrastructure, but in the long term, it could complement existing military aerial surveillance systems.

The EC also wants to see broader cooperation between civilian and military bodies to counter drone threats. But it concedes that protecting facilities such as airports, seaports, and energy infrastructure from low-cost drones cannot rely on the military alone.

This will require relevant procedures and lines of communication to be established between all the actors, including at EU level, and to test this, it wants to see a yearly EU-level counter-drone exercise involving both civilian and military responses.

The Commission says it is also taking forward the European Drone Defence Initiative, which aims to build out capability and industrial efforts at EU level. This work will draw on Ukraine&#39;s battlefield experience in areas of data management systems, including command and control, detection systems, and effector systems (the countermeasures).

&quot;Drone and anti-drone capabilities are central components in defending Europe and securing critical infrastructure,&quot; commented the Commission EVP for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, Henna Virkkunen.

&quot;Today, we are taking a major step toward enhancing security and developing these capabilities together with our member states. In the current geopolitical context, Europe must cultivate home-grown solutions to enhance its collective security. We have the talents, the technologies, and the industrial strength to protect our assets.&quot;

With the EU Action Plan unveiled, the Commission will enter discussions with EU member states on the proposed actions, which it says should be seen as a dynamic process likely to be adapted to changing circumstances and threats. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/chen_weezer_happy_days_windows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s Raymond Chen has revealed an unexpected use for the company&#39;s lawyers: securing permission from the cast of Happy Days so a Weezer music video could ship on the Windows 95 CD.

The video in question was to demonstrate the multimedia capabilities of Microsoft&#39;s successor to the Windows 3.x era. As well as all that 32-bit goodness, the operating system could play back a small, grainy video, and Microsoft included some music videos to emphasize the point.

One was Edie Brickell&#39;s &quot;Good Times&quot; and another was &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; from Weezer&#39;s debut album. Both tracks were recent, and Chen recalled the steps Microsoft had to take to get the latter in front of Windows 95 customers.

&quot;First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer&#39;s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently without the knowledge of the band members themselves,&quot; Chen wrote on his Old New Thing blog.

The band later said the initial disquiet they felt about their music appearing on Windows 95 was offset by the exposure from the operating system&#39;s huge sales.

However, that only accounted for the audio. The video, which took place in a recreation of the Happy Days television show, was a different matter. Happy Days was set in the late 1950s and early 1960s and broadcast during the 1970s and 1980s.

This presented Microsoft&#39;s lawyers with a problem. Since clips from the show had been spliced into the video, Microsoft had to get permission from the actors featured. Chen didn&#39;t recall if the lawyer in question had to talk to the actors directly, &quot;but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler&#39;s telephone number (or his agent&#39;s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.&quot;

Happy Days was responsible for the phrase &quot;jumping the shark,&quot; from an episode in which the Fonzie character, on waterskis, jumped over a shark. It was subsequently used to describe a show or concept that has run out of ideas and resorts to increasingly implausible plot devices.

In other news, Microsoft has continued to load its product lines with AI features, and its flagship operating system, Windows (which has suffered a terrible start to the year with multiple out-of-band fixes), is set to become an agentic OS. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/bma_palantir_nhs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">British doctors are being urged to pull back from the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP) after their union called on members to stop non-clinical use of the Palantir-built system.

The British Medical Association&#39;s (BMA) recommendation follows the US spy-tech firm&#39;s recent work with US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE). The union cited allegations that ICE used Palantir&#39;s bespoke Immigration OS platform to process and link formerly separate datasets, including medical records.

Tom Dolphin, BMA chair of council, wrote in a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), a publication owned by the union: &quot;It is the view of the BMA that doctors working in the NHS can no longer provide the tacit endorsement that using a product implies and must immediately take steps to explore refusing any non-direct care usage of Palantir&#39;s Federated Data Platform, with a view to moving away from the platform entirely in time, when a suitable alternative can be put in place.&quot;

A Palantir spokesperson told The Register: &quot;Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering more NHS operations, helping Royal Navy ships to stay at sea for longer, and helping the police to tackle domestic violence.&quot;

Palantir won £60 million in non-competitive pandemic contracts, starting with an initial £1 agreement. The US vendor later secured a £330 million competitive tender to provide the FDP, which NHS England – the world&#39;s largest healthcare provider – said would be core to clearing its pandemic backlog.

Critics argued that allowing Palantir to carry over technical use cases from its COVID-era platform to the FDP may have skewed the competition. NHS England said the tender was fair and open.

The BMA represents more than 200,000 doctors in the UK and negotiates their pay and conditions with the government.

In his letter to the BMJ, Dolphin said: &quot;While Palantir&#39;s involvement supporting the work of ICE is nothing new, the doctrine and scale of ICE&#39;s role in the United States appears to have shifted dramatically over the past year with violence and deaths seen across the US. Given Palantir&#39;s increasing centrality to our NHS, we must pay attention to the role Palantir plays in facilitating ICE&#39;s activities and the implications this has for patient confidence in an NHS working in partnership with them.&quot;

&quot;Where the NHS uses technology suppliers to manage patient data, it is essential that patients are able to trust that their data is safe and that the NHS remains in control.&quot;

&quot;If patients no longer feel able to trust the NHS to handle their data confidentially or worry that the personal information they share with their doctor will be used for purposes which they do not expect, this will undermine public trust in a confidential health service. This will affect patients&#39; willingness to seek care or their willingness to be candid with their doctor – which would be to the detriment of the safety and effectiveness of their treatment and to public health more generally.&quot;

In a later interview with the BMJ, the BMA chief said: &quot;Given Palantir&#39;s track record, including controversies in the US involving immigration enforcement and the risks to patient trust, data security, and NHS independence, we believe there must be a complete break from Palantir technologies in the NHS and no further contracts awarded.&quot;

The Register has asked NHS England for comment. The soon-to-be-defunct quango previously said no company involved in the FDP would be able to access health and care data without the explicit permission of the NHS. All data within the platform is under the control of the NHS and will only be used for direct care and planning.

In 2023, an NHS England official likened patient data in the FDP to information in an online Microsoft Word document. They told The Register that the cloud operator has access to that document, but the user would not expect Microsoft to look at it. ®

            <div id="article-text">Exclusive When fraudsters go after people&#39;s paychecks, &quot;every employee on earth becomes a target,&quot; according to Binary Defense security sleuth John Dwyer.

In December 2025, managed detection and response outfit Binary Defense&#39;s threat research group ARC Labs investigated a security incident in which a thief redirected a physician&#39;s salary into their own account using a very simple attack that started with a help-desk call.

&quot;This was a combination of exploiting people and processes rather than technology,&quot; Dwyer, the deputy CTO and head of Arc Labs, told The Register in an exclusive interview. &quot;It&#39;s technology-adjacent. This was identity theft from pure-play social engineering into exploiting a weaker-than-advised process internally to gain access.&quot;

The attacker used compromised credentials belonging to a shared mailbox at a healthcare facility. Binary Defenses’ incident responders can&#39;t say for certain how the attacker obtained the credentials. Dwyer said his team found no evidence of phishing and assumes the miscreant obtained the email login info from an earlier breach.

Once the attackers gained access to the mailbox, they snooped around and determined whose identity to assume when calling the help desk to request a password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) reset.

In this case, the attacker pretended to be a physician locked out of their account and thus unable to treat patients.

&quot;The call basically went that this person can&#39;t log into their account, they have patients they need to see right now, they need to get immediate access,&quot; Dwyer said. The fake physician&#39;s name and access-level checked out, so the help desk employee reset the password and MFA token. This gave the attacker access to the account, which enabled the rest of the payroll scam to play out.

It&#39;s technology-adjacent. This was identity theft from pure-play social engineering into exploiting a weaker-than-advised process internally to gain access

&quot;And this is where things get very, very interesting,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;Over the last year where we&#39;ve seen these sort of incidents, it has followed traditional business email compromise attack flows.&quot;

In one such attack targeting university employees and documented by Microsoft, the digital thieves compromised employee accounts to gain access to HR platforms like Workday and then diverted employees&#39; direct-deposit paychecks. The attackers gained initial access through phishing emails, stole MFA codes via an adversary-in-the-middle phishing link, and then accessed the victims&#39; Microsoft Exchange Online inboxes before hijacking their Workday profiles and sending paychecks to attacker-controlled accounts.

&quot;Everything happens through that access, through that mailbox in that Microsoft account,&quot; Dwyer said, adding that the attack targeting the physician looked different. After &quot;recovering&quot; the medico’s identity from the help desk social engineering call, the attacker authenticated from the healthcare organization&#39;s own virtual desktop infrastructure, registered new authentication devices to the account, and logged into the Workday payroll system.

Once they had logged into Workday, the crook changed the banking and direct deposit details to re-route the physician&#39;s paycheck into an attacker-controlled account.

This is about process exploitation and the hijacking of identities, which makes it extraordinarily hard to identify malicious versus normal identity behavior

Using the company&#39;s own virtual infrastructure allowed the attacker to bypass security detections because the logins appeared to be a legitimate internal user with a trusted endpoint and internal IP address.

&quot;With this one, the big thing that really stood out is that the attackers seem to be aware of the detection strategies against them,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;This attack was carried out purely outside of email and leveraging the trusted access through the VDI infrastructure. By abusing the organization&#39;s own virtual desktop infrastructure, so from a security tools point of view, everything looks normal and trusted.&quot;

The organization wasn&#39;t even aware that it had been compromised until the physician asked why they hadn’t been paid.

&quot;It isn&#39;t always about technology hacking,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;This is about process exploitation and the hijacking of identities, which makes it extraordinarily hard to identify malicious versus normal identity behavior. Identity is the new perimeter, and this is a new threat vector in which your persona needs to be treated like a privileged asset, rather than just your computer or your phone.&quot;

In addition to underscoring the security threats around using shared mailboxes, this incident shows how payroll and HR platforms should be viewed as a high-value target for attackers, Dwyer added. For defenders, this requires treating payroll information as a telemetry stream for threat detection and treating payroll changes as high-risk financial events.

&quot;The good news is we already have a model around this – lessons learned from wire fraud and pay and accounts payable fraud applies here,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;Changes that are made to direct deposit information should have to be confirmed in some mechanism, there should be a temporary holding period while it goes through some sort of fraud detection review, or something along those lines.&quot;

While organizations have the technology to do this, they don&#39;t necessarily have the processes in place to address this type of security and business risk, he added.

&quot;Organizations need to consider direct deposit as a legitimate, viable threat vector,&quot; Dwyer said. &quot;If I was a business leader, I would want to get ahead of this, because I wouldn&#39;t want to get into some sort of arbitration with an employee over a lost paycheck.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple fanbois are realizing what the Creator Studio subscription means for its productivity apps, and many are unhappy with the direction of travel.

On January 13, Apple introduced the Apple Creator Studio, which it called (with typical Apple modesty) &quot;an inspiring collection of the most powerful creative apps.&quot;

From January 28, the faithful could spend $12.99 (£12.99 in the UK) per month (or $129/ £129 per year) on a suite of applications that included &quot;intelligent features and premium content for Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and later Freeform for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.&quot;

&quot;[With] Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Freeform, Apple Creator Studio subscribers can be more expressive and productive with new premium content and intelligent features across Mac, iPad, and iPhone,&quot; Apple enthused.

Except that Keynote, Pages, and Numbers have traditionally been free with macOS. That&#39;s not changing - but users wanting premium features, many powered by Apple Intelligence or OpenAI, will need to subscribe.

Apple is now pushing upgrade ads at users, prompting complaints in the company&#39;s own forums.

One put it bluntly: &quot;Apple apps are not supposed to be an ad-laden experience. We aren&#39;t here for that.&quot;

While there is nothing new about products urging users to pay for a subscription or to upgrade (see Microsoft), it is jarring for Apple users who likely hoped the company was above such things in its productivity apps.

In 2024, when questioned about charging for AI-enhanced services in an interview with WIRED, Apple boss Tim Cook said: &quot;We never talked about charging for it. We view it sort of like multitouch, which enabled the smartphone revolution and the modern tablet.&quot;

Clearly, Apple has talked about it since then.

What&#39;s New screen in Pages asking for an upgrade

Users were also not warned that an upgrade would include nagging about a premium subscription, which has stuck in their craw.

For context, users aren&#39;t required to subscribe, but pop-ups frequently suggest they should for various features.

Still, ads in Apple&#39;s productivity suite, even for its own services, feel like a slippery slope. As one user put it: &quot;makes me worry this is a creeping approach to a macOS bloatware strategy. ®

Despite evidence to the contrary, not only are wired earbuds alive and well, they’re enjoying a resurgence. Brands like Belkin and even respected headphone maker Master & Dynamic now offer tethered earbuds again. Even the Italian fashion brand Diesel has decided wired headphones are still cool and has launched a pair of earbuds it describes as being “designed for fearless daily use.” We’re not entirely sure what that means, but these earbuds definitely look distinctly Diesel.

The headphones aren’t yet listed on the US version of Diesel’s website, but you can find them on the company’s UK site where they’re priced at £89.95, or around $123. That’s cheaper than Master & Dynamic’s $199 ME05 wired earbuds, but at least we have a full run down of the tech inside M&D’s.

Diesel’s website doesn’t go into details about what drivers you’ll find inside its 60458 Wired Earbuds, but images reveal they’re designed to connect to mobile devices over USB-C, and include an inline remote with volume and playback controls, a microphone, and a sliding switch to mute the mic. The earbuds have a silver finish, but the chains wrapping the wires and attached charms (capitalizing on another trend) are actually made from less precious metals like aluminum and zinc.

            <div id="article-text">Tokyo Scramble becomes a very different experience when played with a group.

Tokyo Scramble becomes a very different experience when played with a group.

GameShare, a multiplayer feature that’s exclusive to the Switch 2, is a neat concept that so far has mostly been used in pretty standard ways. It lets you use one copy of a game and beam it to multiple Switches, making it a great way to experience local co-op titles like Survival Kids or Split Fiction. But I’ve finally found an inventive, and quite frankly bizarre, use for GameShare: turning survival horror into something more like a comedy.

Tokyo Scramble launches this week as a Switch 2 exclusive, and it’s a game that channels some of the slow, deliberate pace of genre classics like the original Resident Evil. You play as Anne, a woman who was riding a subway in Tokyo that then crashed deep into the Earth, revealing a hidden underground world full of dinosaur-like monsters. You don’t have a gun or any weapons to defend yourself. Instead, Anne’s most important tool is her smartwatch: It lets her interact with everything from escalators to turnstiles in order to distract the monsters and then sneak to safety.

In that way it’s like old-school survival horror mixed with a puzzle game, as you have to figure out how to use the environment to stay safe while dealing with new and increasingly dangerous creatures. An early boss, for example, is a giant bat with super-sensitive hearing, forcing you to stay perfectly still whenever its ears perk up. But turn on a fire alarm using your watch and that keen sense of hearing becomes a weakness.

At this point you might be asking yourself how, exactly, that kind of solitary survival experience could work as a multiplayer game. And the answer is pretty unexpected. Using GameShare, you can play Tokyo Scramble with up to three other people. And you all play by controlling different aspects of the same character. One player could manage Anne’s movement, for instance, while another is in charge of rotating the camera. I played through a number of levels as a two-player experience with the following setup: I was in charge of moving around the levels, while my partner handled everything else (camera, performing actions, and activating the smartwatch apps).

This is, as you can probably imagine, a challenging way to play a video game. I kept having to say out loud that I needed the camera pointed in a specific direction so that I could actually see the dinosaurs I was trying to avoid, while my partner would snap at me to get closer to something they needed to interact with. These are all actions I intuitively perform when playing a game like this solo, but I had to really think about what I needed to do — and then vocalize it — in order to get anywhere in Tokyo Scramble. And to be clear, we didn’t get very far. Our version of Anne, controlled by two different people, kept being slaughtered by giant praying mantises with glowing red eyes. We were yelling at each other just to perform the most basic tasks, which we almost always failed to do.

The thing is, while the added challenge of playing cooperatively sucked out any of the tension or scares in the game, it did turn it into a singular experience that was actually kind of fun. It was certainly like no other multiplayer game I’d ever played before. It had a lot of the same appeal as the friendslop genre that has taken over Twitch and YouTube: The goofiness is part of what makes it work when you’re playing with a bud.

Mostly, though, Tokyo Scramble has me hoping to see more experiments like this in the Switch 2’s future. Nintendo consoles often have gimmicky features that go underutilized, like the HD rumble of the original Switch that didn’t get much use outside of a handful of titles. It’d be a shame if the same happened to GameShare. And given how many Switch consoles are out there — GameShare supports both the Switch 2 and the original Switch for sharing games — there’s a lot of potential. We just need some more out-there ideas like Tokyo Scramble.

            <div id="article-text">The community around Meta’s giant new data center in North Louisiana was hit hard by a winter storm and freezing temperatures. How will the power grid hold up once the data center is online?

The community around Meta’s giant new data center in North Louisiana was hit hard by a winter storm and freezing temperatures. How will the power grid hold up once the data center is online?

Donna Collins lives about 20 miles from where Meta’s biggest data center is being built, in a house her family has lived in for five generations. Construction has thrown the small agricultural community in North Louisiana into the spotlight as a high-profile example of how the infrastructure behind generative AI could impact nearby residents.

For Collins, this place is “a little piece of heaven.” “It’s all I’ve ever known as a home. It’s quiet. It’s rural. It is beautiful,” she says. “We can’t imagine the changes that are coming.”

The region was particularly hard-hit by the recent cold snap that knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Frigid temperatures raise electricity rates — as well as questions about how ready power grids will be for future disasters while straining under growing pressure from data centers. Louisiana has built back time and again from storm after storm, but now community members and advocates want assurances that energy-hungry data centers won’t add to the costs.

“We can’t imagine the changes that are coming.”

“We’re very nervous,” Collins says. “When the wind blows, electricity goes out here in a lot of these remote areas. We live in an area where electricity is kind of uncertain as is.”

The recent “icepocalypse,” as Collins described, arrived with a January 24th winter storm. The storm was only the start — forecasters had warned that persistent freezing temperatures would allow ice to build up on trees and energy infrastructure across a large part of the US east of the Rockies. The weight of that ice can bring power lines crashing down or snarl them with falling branches.

By February 5th, local utility Entergy Louisiana said that it had finished restoring power to almost 130,000 customers affected. Collins says her home, which is served by an electric cooperative, lost power for four days. She also owns a property she uses as an Airbnb, served by Entergy, which lost power for a few days.

Meta might be Entergy’s most controversial new customer in the area. The utility is building three new gas plants to supply enough electricity for Meta’s $27 billion AI data center in Richland Parish. The facility is expected to use three times as much electricity annually as the city of New Orleans. Meta’s data center and two of the gas plants are under construction, with the data center slated to be completed in 2030. It’s too soon for them to have had an impact on the power grid during this storm.

But consumer advocates are concerned about whether residents could get stuck with higher bills as a result of rising electricity demand and new infrastructure being built for Meta, and they are already pushing for stronger protections. Gas prices spiked as wells froze up while the cold snap increased demand for the fuel used in heating and electricity. In the coming months, those increased costs are likely to show up on residents’s utility bills. Advocates are worried that the price spike could be even higher as more energy-hungry data centers used for generative AI connect to the grid.

“In a world where those three new gas power plants [serving Meta] are online, that would be further upward pressure on the cost of gas and therefore on the cost of both home heating and the cost of electricity on the larger market,” Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE), tells The Verge.

Entergy didn’t respond to requests for comment. In a statement to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle said, “We worked closely with Entergy to provide additional protection for customers, which projects that the electricity payments for the Richland Parish Data Center will cut both grid upgrade customer costs and storm charges by about 10%, resulting in $650 million in customer savings over 15 years.”

But while Meta has agreed to pay for 15 years of the capital costs of the three new power plants, Burke says that’s an incomplete picture. There are more costs associated with upgrading transmission lines, for example, and Burke is still concerned about increased demand for gas and electricity raising utility bills for other customers.

Earlier this month, Burke’s organization and the Union of Concerned Scientists also filed a response to a grid stability analysis Entergy conducted, alleging it “fails to adequately assess the reliability risks of serving the data center.” Specifically, they’re calling on the utility to redo the analysis to more thoroughly assess what would happen to the grid if there were to be a large disturbance like a transmission line or power plant going down, as the state has already seen happen during major storms.

“People in North Louisiana are already facing a lot of outages, and there’s this new [project] that is being rushed through the process, not adequately studied in terms of impact on the grid,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It could potentially cause even more disruptions and cause even more harm if we don’t take this seriously enough.”

Across the US, local opposition to other data center projects — often driven by concerns about how much electricity and water they would use — have led to delays and cancellations. In North Louisiana, Collins says residents are worried about property costs, taxes, and rents going up, too.

Meta’s moving into a community where the landscape has been defined by farmland for generations. Collins hopes the company follows through on pledges to support local vocational training and hiring as local farmers find it harder to make a living. She has a nephew who’s a farmer who now works at the Meta construction site.“I’m not against progress,” she says. “But, you know… those of us that have lived here our whole lives have to be concerned about our water supply, our electricity cost, our property values and taxes. All of those are big concerns because we’re going to pay the price.”

            <div id="article-text">The latest version of Process Zero in the Halide iPhone app benefits from HDR and ProRAW support.

The latest version of Process Zero in the Halide iPhone app benefits from HDR and ProRAW support.

Something happens every time I try to use an iPhone camera like a real camera.

Here’s how it goes: I shoot RAW in addition to the default HEIC output, and since I have the RAW file I might as well edit it to my taste. And if I’m going to do that, I want to use Lightroom on my MacBook. You know, real software. Then I remember: iPhone photos hate real software. Moving image files between devices is mysterious. If I Airdrop them to my MacBook will the HDR gain map tag along? Why do my photos always come out of Lightroom looking different than my edit? Where did that gain map go? I lack the patience to find out, so I just live with what my phone camera produces on its own and leave the heavy lifting to my “real” camera.

This has its pros and cons. On the plus side, it’s way easier to deal with iPhone photos if they never leave the native camera app. But it also means leaving processing up to the iPhone, which tends to run amok with sharpening and raising shadows. I lean on the app’s built-in Photographic Styles (shout out to Rich Contrast, you’re a real one) to avoid this, but lots of people look to third party options like Halide’s Process Zero.

Halide introduced this mode to its popular iPhone camera app last year. Process Zero promises to strip away the excess processing the native camera pipeline applies to images, resulting in photos with deeper shadows and less aggressive sharpening. Sounds great if you’re sick of the processed-to-death phone camera look!

But I’ll admit to being a bit of a Process Zero skeptic. I lived through the pre-computational-photography era of crappy phone cameras, and I generally prefer the lower noise and usable low light photos you get with current camera tech. With a higher contrast photo style applied, it gets me close enough to the look I like, even if it feels like I’m taking pictures with a computer and not so much a camera. But Halide just released the second version of Process Zero in beta, adding a couple of features that got me interested: HDR support, and the ability to shoot in Apple’s RAW format.

If those sound antithetical to Process Zero’s whole deal, well, maybe they are. And if we’re being technical about it, there was already some processing going on in Process Zero — there’s no other way to turn a bunch of sensor data into a usable image. But here’s what I appreciate about version two’s upgrades. First of all, adding HDR support doesn’t mean it’s going to turn your photo into a Thomas Kinkade painting. It means that the brightest areas of your photo can be brighter, creating a greater contrast between light and dark areas of the image. It’s the exact opposite of the flat, HDR-ish look that phone cameras often produce to try and represent a wide range of tones for an SDR screen. Don’t take my word for it; listen to Marc Levoy, who pioneered computational photography on smartphones.

There’s also the option to shoot HEIC + RAW, meaning that in addition to the Process Zero image, you’ll have a DNG file that has been through some of Apple’s computational pipeline. Apple’s ProRAW format combines multiple frames to reduce noise, but retains all of the extra data you’d expect a RAW file to contain so you can apply your preferred tone mapping. You can turn this additional RAW capture on or off, and it doesn’t affect the Process Zero output, so you can treat it like a failsafe if you don’t like the default image.

Whether or not you shoot RAW, you’ll have an option to adjust tone mapping within the Halide app through a new feature called Tone Fusion. It essentially boosts shadows, but it’s in your control and it’s not as intense as Apple’s tendencies. Even when I crank it all the way up, it doesn’t try to shift a blown-out sky blue the way the native iPhone processing does, and I appreciate that.

I think an underrated benefit of Process Zero, or Adobe’s Project Indigo, is what it does for your mindset as you take photos. Sure, you could achieve the same kind of look by shooting with ProRAW in the native camera app, taking the photo into Lightroom, and adjusting contrast to your liking. But Process Zero provides appealing results straight out of the camera; it feels different knowing you’re going to get something you like right away, rather than a file you have to fight with first.

I also feel like it gives me permission to think of myself as a photographer for a little while, not just a person with a phone. I went on a little photo walk in Seattle’s Pioneer Square and International District neighborhoods, which I’ve done dozens of times over the past decade. Outside Union Station — an old train station-turned-transit-agency-headquarters — I noticed a sign I’d never seen before, noting that the building’s great hall was open to the public. I’m not sure I would have bothered if I was just out wandering around, but with a specialized camera app on my phone I felt more like I was out doing photography, so I went in. It’s stunning, as it turns out, and I don’t know how I went over a decade living in this city without setting foot inside.

And you know what? I do like the photos I got in there with Process Zero. Shooting with a ProRAW file in my back pocket, I knew I’d have something to work with if I didn’t like the default. But I haven’t touched those files, because the JPEGs are great. There was some late afternoon sun illuminating the station’s massive windows; rather than trying to bring those highlights down and boost every shadow, Process Zero lets the bright spots clip and keeps the emphasis on the interior. The HDR gain map lets the brightest parts of the scene pop, creating contrast between the fully illuminated windows and the slightly-less-bright golden sunlight filtering in against the wall. HDR is good, y’all.

Process Zero v2 is part of a public preview of Halide’s larger Mark III update, so things might change before it’s finalized. But I like what I’m seeing, especially for Process Zero. The computational photography era has offered us a lot more than some over-processed JPEGs — the fact that we can take decent photos in basically any light conditions with the tiny sensors on our phones is nothing short of a technological triumph. Updating Process Zero to incorporate some of those benefits, if and when you want them, doesn’t detract from the minimalist experience; it’s an enhancement. And it’s enough to convert a skeptic like me.

            <div id="article-text">The Pokémon Company, Koei Tecmo, and Game Freak’s new life sim game is more than a charming spin on Animal Crossing.

The Pokémon Company, Koei Tecmo, and Game Freak’s new life sim game is more than a charming spin on Animal Crossing.

Though catching monsters and making them fight have always been core elements of the Pokémon brand, spinoffs like the Pokémon Snap and Detective Pikachu series have stood out by approaching the franchise from different angles. In different (and often small) ways, recent mainline Pokémon titles like Sword / Shield, Scarlet / Violet, and Legends: Z-A have acknowledged that there are some players who would much rather spend their time hanging out and taking pictures with their monster friends.

That leisurely approach to enjoying the Pokémon world doesn’t exactly gel with the main games’ focus on becoming a competitive champion, but it is exactly the sort of mindset you should have when you start playing Pokémon Pokopia for the Nintendo Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force division, Pokopia feels like Nintendo taking another stab at everything that makes Animal Crossing so enjoyable while experimenting with features from other crafting-forward games, like Minecraft.

Pokopia uses conventions from the core Pokémon series to make its spin on classic life simulation game mechanics like building and nurturing relationships feel distinct. It’s a fun, cute game that plays just differently enough from Animal Crossing to say that Pokopia isn’t simply a Pokémon-themed New Horizons. But what delighted me most when I recently spent some hands-on time with the game was how — when you look past its bright, island-y vibes — Pokopia’s story seems to be teasing something dark and ominous about the Pokémon world.

In Pokopia, you play as an unusual Ditto that has somehow ended up on an island after getting separated from its trainer. This Ditto isn’t great at transforming into other pokémon, and it doesn’t remember what happened to its partner. But after finding its lost trainer’s pokédex, the Ditto uses its powers to assume their form (the game’s character customization options are surprisingly robust), and it starts to explore the land around it.

When I first started playing, I knew that Pokopia was focused on a Ditto in human drag making friends with other pokémon, like Professor Tangrowth, and creating unique habitats to attract more monsters. But I was surprised and intrigued when the grass-type professor explained that it hadn’t seen another living human or pokémon out in “the desolate world” for a very long time.

After teasing me with the mystery of what happened to everyone, Pokopia dropped me right into a simple bit of gameplay involving a dehydrated Squirtle that covered the basics of how things work on the island. By meeting certain pokémon with special moves like Water Gun, Ditto can copy them and use their powers to affect terrain in the game. When selected, each move — which can only be used a certain number of times before you have to eat to recharge your Power Points — displays a grid of squares letting you know the areas it will affect when used.

Hitting patches of dried-up grass with Water Gun turned them vibrant green, and when I’d created enough connected grass squares, they sparkled to let me know that I had created a patch of Tall Grass. In Pokopia, your Pokédex registers pokémon and areas like Tall Grass as different kinds of habitats where specific monsters might show up. A timid but friendly Charmander popped out of my first patch of Tall Grass, and its powers were exactly what I needed to start a campfire. The deeper you get into Pokopia, the more complex creating new habitats becomes.

Some pokémon would only spawn if I created patches of grass shaded by large boulders, while others required me to cultivate fertile ground with wheelbarrows nearby. I had to have already met certain pokémon in order to use the moves necessary to create the conditions that would attract new monsters. And it wasn’t always guaranteed that the exact pokémon I wanted would spawn when their habitat requirements were met.

The more pokémon you befriend on the island, the more Pokopia begins to open up in terms of space that you can explore and things you can build using Animal Crossing-style recipes and workbenches. I could easily imagine myself spending hours just making places for wild pokémon to relax, but Pokopia is also clearly a game that’s aimed at builders. With the right moves and transformations, you can start doing heavy construction to reshape your island’s geography or travel to other nearby landmasses. Full-on island overhauls might take a while to complete if you’re working by yourself, but the work can go much faster when you’re using Pokopia’s multiplayer mode.

During my demo run, my groupmates and I didn’t spend much time trying to complete the objective we were encouraged to focus on as a team because it was much more fun to run around transforming into Dragonites and flying through the air. But if we had been a little more goal-oriented, we could have built some buildings or snapped a few group photos with our conspicuously retro Pokédexes.

Aside from the foreshadowed desolation, what struck me most about Pokopia was how relaxing its interpolations of classic Pokémon songs were and how expressive the game’s monster animations are. Though the game isn’t voice acted, pokémon’s faces charmingly convey the emotions they’re feeling — sometimes they’re excited to talk to you, sometimes they’re in a bad mood and need cheering up — as you visit them in their new homes. And while I wasn’t able to get a look at just how many pokémon can be befriended in the game, it was clear that a sizable number of them can make appearances on the island.

Even though it’s clearly aimed at kids, Pokopia feels like the kind of game that’s going to be just as enjoyable for adult Pokémon fans when it hits the Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5th. And if the game’s deeper story is anywhere nearly as dark as it seems, it might be one of the franchise’s most fascinating side stories yet.

The FAA originally said the shutdown could last 10 days, but it ended up only lasting hours.

The Federal Aviation Administration has lifted its temporary closure to the airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas, after originally saying that all flights in and out of the airport would be grounded for 10 days. No explanation for the closure was given, beyond a vague reference to “Special Security Reasons.” CBS News reported the closure was “triggered by Mexican cartel drones breaching US airspace.” The Department of Defense has reportedly disabled the drones, the news outlet said.

The closure was announced late on February 10th in a notice on the FAA website, and was expected to apply until February 20th. A second notice lists a similar closure for nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Airspace in a 10-mile radius around El Paso airport was included, though flights above 18,000 feet are unaffected, as is Mexican airspace.

El Paso operates flights from major US airlines including Southwest, Delta, United, and American. The New York Times reports that Southwest will be most affected by the closure, with 480 flights scheduled through the 10-day period. An unnamed spokesperson for the airport told the Times that the closure was issued “on short notice,” and in a social media post has told travelers to contact their airlines for more information.

“From what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning, there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas,” El Paso congresswoman Veronica Escobar said in a series of posts on X. “There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations. We have urged the F.A.A. to lift the Temporary Flight Restrictions placed on the El Paso area.”

Update February 11th: This story has been updated to reflect the FAA’s order to lift its temporary closure of El Paso’s airspace, and to include CBS News report about “Mexican cartel drones”.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

In an exclusive interview, the AI pioneer shares his plans for his new Paris-based company, AMI Labs.

For a few days recently, the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed? Or something else entirely? Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <h2>Naboo raises $70M to turn AI event planning into corporate procurement platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.
