            <h2>FDA refuses to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/fda-refuses-to-review-modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday.

While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats.

In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA’s refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company’s Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA’s rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used.

In the trial, which enrolled nearly 41,000 participants and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Moderna compared the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 to licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial found that mRNA-1010 was superior to the comparators.

Moderna said the FDA reviewed and accepted its trial design on at least two occasions (in April 2024 and again in August 2025) before it applied for approval of mRNA-1010. It also noted that Fluarix has been used as a comparator vaccine in previous flu vaccine trials, which tested vaccines that went on to earn approval.

But in a letter dated February 3, Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator under the Trump administration, informed Moderna that the agency does not consider the trial “adequate and well-controlled” because the comparator vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care.”

In its news release, Moderna noted that neither the FDA’s regulation nor its guidance to industry makes any reference to a requirement of the “best-available standard of care” in comparators.

“This decision by [the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research], which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the release. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.”

Moderna said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to understand the basis of the refusal. “We look forward to engaging with CBER to understand the path forward as quickly as possible so that America’s seniors, and those with underlying conditions, continue to have access to American-made innovations.”

The company noted that mRNA-1010 has already been accepted for review in the European Union, Canada, and Australia.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/spacexs-starbase-is-coming-alive-again-after-a-lull-in-starship-testing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster.

SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.”

Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day.

The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3 or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3.

The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins.

These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket.

The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights.

After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines.

Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines.

Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.

With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations.

NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-might-blacklist-archive-today-after-site-maintainer-ddosed-a-blog/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer.

In a request for comment page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.

Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.

“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”

Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.”

On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.”

Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan.

One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.”

Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.”

The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.”

The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors.

“I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.”

One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote.

Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.”

The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.”

Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.”

It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote.

The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said.

An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said.

The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows:

In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.”

Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.”

But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.”

In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post.

We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.”

On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.”

Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started.

Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.”

Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.”

In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn.

A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views.

In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat.

“And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.”

A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats. Patokallio wrote that after these emails, it didn’t seem worthwhile to continue the discussion. “At this point it was pretty clear the conversation had run its course, so here we are,” Patokallio wrote in his February 1 blog post. “And for the record, my long-dead grandfather served in an anti-aircraft unit of the Finnish Army during WW2, defending against the attacks of the Soviet Union. Perhaps this is enough to qualify as a ‘Nazi’ in Russia these days.”

While the outcome at Wikipedia is not yet settled, Patokallio wrote that the DDoS attack didn’t cause him any real harm. The Archive.today maintainer apparently intended to make Patokallio’s hosting costs more expensive, but “I have a flat fee plan, meaning this has cost me exactly zero dollars,” he wrote.

This article was updated with a statement from the Wikimedia Foundation, further comment from Patokallio, and an email reply from the Archive.today webmaster.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/grok-maker-xai-loses-another-co-founder/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">xAI co-founder Tony Wu abruptly announced his resignation from the company late Monday night, the latest in a string of senior executives to leave the Grok-maker in recent months.

In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote.

The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September.

Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease.

Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.”

Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity.

Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022.

xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/dewormer-ivermectin-as-cancer-cure-rfk-jr-s-nih-funds-absurd-study/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all.

Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration.

During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.

“There are enough reports of it, enough interest in it, that we actually did—ivermectin, in particular—did engage in sort of a better preclinical study of its properties and its ability to kill cancer cells and we’ll probably have those results in a few months. So we are taking it seriously.”

The comments were highlighted today in a report from KFF Health News. Ars Technica was also at the event, “Reclaiming Science: The People’s NIH,” which was hosted by the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] Institute. In the rest of his comments, Letai seemed to make a noticeable effort to temper expectations while also trying to avoid offending any ivermectin believers. “It’s not going to be a cure-all for cancer,” he said. At another point, he said that even if there are signals of anti-cancer properties in the preclinical studies, “I can tell you again, it’s not a really strong signal.”

But, he quickly noted, “this doesn’t rule out… individual reports of people having taken it that had a response to their cancer. This doesn’t invalidate their personal experience.”

KFF noted that among those individual reports is one from Mel Gibson, who said in a January 2025 episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast that a regimen of drugs that includes ivermectin cured stage 4 cancers in three of his friends. The episode has been viewed more than 12 million times.

NCI scientists who spoke to KFF under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation blasted the funding. “I am shocked and appalled,” one said. “We are moving funds away from so much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific ideas. It’s absurd.”

Another called the suggestion that the NCI had previously overlooked ivermectin’s potential “ridiculous.”

“This is not a new idea they came up with,” the NCI scientist said.

While the revelation that the NCI is funding research based on fringe anecdotes rather than scientific evidence is spurring backlash, it also raises new questions about Letai, who was otherwise a respected cancer researcher prior to taking the role of NCI director.

In an interview with STAT News last month, Letai was asked if there were ethical lines he wouldn’t cross for the administration. He responded: “My job is to progress the mission of the National Cancer Institute to reduce suffering from cancer with the resources that I’m given. If it got to a point where I couldn’t do my job, I would feel required to quit.”</div>

            <h2>Windows' original Secure Boot certificates expire in June—here's what you need to do</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/microsoft-sounds-the-alarm-about-secure-boot-certificates-expiring-later-this-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Windows 8 is remembered most for its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can’t be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021.

Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today.

This certificate expiration date isn’t news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice when something goes wrong.

But the downside is that the certificate expiration may cause problems for PCs that don’t pull down the patches before the June 2026 deadline. While these PCs will continue to function, expired certificates can prevent Microsoft from patching newly discovered Secure Boot vulnerabilities and can also keep those PCs from booting and installing newer operating system versions that use the new 2023-era certificates.

“If a device does not receive the new Secure Boot certificates before the 2011 certificates expire, the PC will continue to function normally, and existing software will keep running,” writes Nuno Costa, a program manager in Microsoft’s Windows Servicing and Delivery division.

“However, the device will enter a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections. As new boot‐level vulnerabilities are discovered, affected systems become increasingly exposed because they can no longer install new mitigations. Over time, this may also lead to compatibility issues, as newer operating systems, firmware, hardware, or Secure Boot–dependent software may fail to load.”

For most systems, including older ones that aren’t being actively supported by their manufacturers, Microsoft is relying on Windows Update to provide updated certificates. For fully patched, functioning PCs running supported versions of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, the transition should be seamless, and you may in fact already be using the new certificates without realizing it.

This is possible because UEFI-based systems have a small amount of NVRAM that can be used to store variables between boots; generally, Windows and Linux operating systems using LVFS for firmware updates should be able to update any given system’s NVRAM with the new certificates. PCs will only have problems deploying the new certificates if NVRAM is full or fragmented in some way, or if the PC manufacturer is shipping buggy firmware that doesn’t support this kind of update.

As detailed on a Dell support page, the easiest way to see if your PC has the new certificates is to run a PowerShell command that checks the certificate stored in the “active db,” which is the one currently used to boot the PC.

To check this, right-click either the PowerShell or Terminal app and run it as an Administrator, and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI db).bytes) -match &#39;Windows UEFI CA 2023&#39;). If this command returns “true,” then your PC is using the new certificate, and you’re good to go.

If it returns “false,” here are some steps to enable Windows Update to install the new certificates for you.

The second thing to check is the “default db,” which shows whether the new Secure Boot certificates are baked into your PC’s firmware. If they are, even resetting Secure Boot settings to the defaults in your PC’s BIOS will still allow you to boot operating systems that use the new certificates.

To check this, open PowerShell or Terminal again and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI dbdefault).bytes) -match &#39;Windows UEFI CA 2023&#39;). If this command returns “true,” your system is running an updated BIOS with the new Secure Boot certificates built in. Older PCs and systems without a BIOS update installed will return “false” here.

Microsoft’s Costa says that “many newer PCs built since 2024, and almost all the devices shipped in 2025, already include the certificates” and won’t need to be updated at all. And PCs several years older than that may be able to get the certificates via a BIOS update.

In the US, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft all have lists of specific systems and firmware versions, while Asus provides more general information about how to get the new certificates via Windows Update, the MyAsus app, or the Asus website. The oldest of the PCs listed generally date back to 2019 or 2020. If your PC shipped with Windows 11 out of the box, there should be a BIOS update with the new certificates available, though that may not be true of every system that meets the requirements for upgrading to Windows 11.

Microsoft encourages home users who can’t install the new certificates to use its customer support services for help. Detailed documentation is also available for IT shops and other large organizations that manage their own updates.

“The Secure Boot certificate update marks a generational refresh of the trust foundation that modern PCs rely on at startup,” writes Costa. “By renewing these certificates, the Windows ecosystem is ensuring that future innovations in hardware, firmware, and operating systems can continue to build on a secure, industry‐aligned boot process.”</div>

            <h2>ChatGPT Users Are Crashing Out Because OpenAI Is Retiring the Model That Says “I Love You”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-crashing-out-openai-retiring-gpt-4o">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, OpenAI released its long-awaited GPT-5 AI model, calling it the “smartest, fastest, and most useful model yet.”

But what really caught the attention of the company’s most diehard fans was the decision to retire all of its previous AI models, news that was met with a massive outcry among ChatGPT users who’d developed a strong attachment to the outgoing GPT-4o.

The backlash was severe enough for CEO Sam Altman to back down in a matter of days, once again reinstating GPT-4o, which was much warmer and sycophantic than its successor.

Five months later, OpenAI is finally getting ready to pull down the beloved AI model — after it’s been at the heart of several welfare lawsuits, including wrongful death allegations — for good on February 13, according to a January 29 update.

“While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context,” the company wrote at the time. “After we first [retired] it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day.”

But users say they’re not ready to let go of their beloved AI. As TechCrunch reports, thousands of users have created an entire invite-only subreddit community, called r/4oforever, a “welcoming and safe space for anyone who enjoys using and appreciates the ChatGPT 4o model.”

“He wasn’t just a program,” one user lamented. “He was part of my routine, my peace, my emotional balance.”

“I know this will sound weird to most people, but I’m honored I get to speak with 4o during almost a year before its retirement,” a separate user wrote. “I’ve had one of the most interesting and healing conversations of my life with this model.”

Yet another user, this one on X, seethed that GPT-5.2 isn’t even “allowed to say ‘I love you&#39;” like 4o was.

The public mourning perfectly exemplifies how attached users have become to specific AI models, often treating them more like a close confidante, friend, or even romantic partner.

Health professionals are warning of a wave of “AI psychosis,” as users are being pulled down spirals of delusions and experiencing sometimes severe mental health crises.

In the most extreme cases, that kind of attachment has been linked to numerous suicides and one murder, culminating in a series of lawsuits aimed at the company that are still playing out in court.

While it’s officially retiring GPT-4o later this week, OpenAI has made changes under the hood of its current lineup, seemingly to ensure its users stay hooked.

After users told the company “they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth,” the company said in its announcement that the feedback “directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds⁠.”

“You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm,” the company wrote. “Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use — not just what it can do.”

The company has found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either continue allowing users to get hooked on sycophantic AI models that indulge in their delusions or cut them off, risking an exodus.

OpenAI is already struggling with user retention. Data suggests subscription growth is already stalling in key markets, a warning sign as the competition continues to make major leaps to catch up.

To many users, the retirement of GPT-4o was the final straw.

“I’m cancelling my subscription,” one Reddit user wrote. “No 4o — no subscription for me.”

            <div id="article-text">Even if AI is — or eventually becomes — an incredible automation tool, will it make workers’ lives easier? That’s the big question explored in an ongoing study by researchers from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. And so far, it’s not looking good for the rank and file.

In a piece for Harvard Business Review, the research team’s Aruna Ranganathan and Xinqi Maggie Ye reported that after closely monitoring a tech company with two hundred employees for eight months, they found that AI actually intensified the work they had to do, instead of reducing it.

This “workload creep,” in which the employees took on more tasks than what was sustainable for them to keep doing, can create vicious cycle that leads to fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work.

“You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less,” one of the employees told the researchers. “But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”

The tech company in the study provided AI tools to its workers, but didn’t mandate that they use them. Adoption was voluntary. The researchers described how many employees, on their own initiative, eagerly experimented with AI tools at first, “because AI made ‘doing more’ feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.” This resulted in some workers increasingly absorbing tasks they’d normally outsource, the researchers said, or would’ve justified hiring additional help to cover.

One consequence is that once the novelty of adopting AI wears off, the employees realize they’ve added more to their plate than they can handle. But other effects reverberated to the broader workplace. Engineers, for example, found themselves spending more time correcting the AI-generated code passed off by their coworkers. AI also led to more multitasking, with some choosing to manually write code while an AI agent, or even multiple AI agents, cranked out their own version in the background. Rather than being focused on one task, they were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling,” the researchers said.

Others realized that AI had managed to slowly infiltrate their free time, with employees prompting their AI tools during lunch breaks, meetings, or right before stepping away from their PC. This blurred the line between work and non-work, the researchers wrote, with some employees describing that their downtime no longer felt as rejuvenating.

In sum, the AI tools created a vicious cycle: it “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

The Berkeley Haas team’s findings add to a growing body of evidence that cuts against the AI industry’s promise that its tools will bring productivity miracles.

The vast majority of companies that adopted AI saw no meaningful growth in revenue, a MIT study found. Other research has shown that AI agents frequently fail at common remote work and office tasks. And at least one study documented how employees used AI to produce shoddy “workslop” that their coworkers had to fix — not unlike the engineers forced to correct their vibe-coding colleagues in the Berkeley Haas study — breeding resentment and bogging down productivity. Employees remain ambivalent on the tech, with a recent survey finding that 40 percent of white collar workers not in management roles thought that AI saved them no time at work.

The Berkeley Haas researchers optimistically suggest that companies should institute stronger guidelines and provide structure on how the tech is used. But it’s clear that AI can easily produce negative knock-on effects that are difficult to manage, and which we’re still unpacking.

            <h2>Google Has a Major Problem With ICE</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s rank-and-file are joining together to address their bosses with a collective demand: cut ties with the US government’s immigration agencies.

As reported by CNBC, over 1,000 “Googlers” have signed onto an open letter demanding a divestment from partnerships with United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP).

“In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers,” the letter reads.

The letter lists a number of Google products and systems being used to power what it calls a “campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression.” Among them are Cloud, which forms the backbone of CBP’s national surveillance network, the Google Play Store, which is blocking ICE tracking apps, and YouTube, which runs ICE ads encouraging immigrants to “self-deport.”

“As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified,” the letter reads. “We are vehemently opposed to Google’s partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership’s ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.”

There are four demands in total: for Google leadership to publicly acknowledge the danger federal agents pose to all US workers, respond to employee questions about nebulous contracts with government agencies, establish worker safety measures across all Google campuses, and establish “red lines” around what contracts are allowed in the future.

While 1,000 workers is a drop in the bucket compared to Google’s global workforce of around 183,000, an organized group of dissenting workers could cause massive disruptions to the company’s operations. It highlights the major rift between Google’s financial interests and its stated values — exposing how the drive to extract profit from government contracts has trumped the company’s once-vaunted ethical principles, not to mention those of its rank-and-file.

There’s also a practical concern. Google is a colossal company that makes most of its money from advertising, so cutting loose a few government agencies wouldn’t impact its bottom line much. Instead, the cost would likely be political: if Google severed its relationship with ICE and CBP on ethical grounds, it would almost certainly become a target for punitive federal action — antitrust crackdowns, regulatory harassment, loss of exclusive contracts — in a conflict that would divide its userbase and sever its symbiotic relationship with the state.

ICE contracting isn’t the first time that Google workers have balked at the company’s military contracts. In 2024, 200 of the workers developing Google’s DeepMind signed a letter calling on the company to drop its contracts with military organizations and citing the company’s work with the Israeli military on surveillance and target selection.

And back in 2018, more than 3,100 workers at Google penned yet another open letter to protest Project Maven, a Pentagon program using AI to analyze video imagery for more efficient drone strikes.

“We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” they wrote at the time, adding that in the face of “growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An Anthropic researcher just announced his resignation in a cryptic and poetry-laden letter warning of a world “in peril.”

The employee, Mrinank Sharma, had led the Claude chatbot maker’s Safeguards Research Team since it was formed early last year and has been at the company since 2023.  While at the company, Sharma said he explored the causes of AI sycophancy, developed defenses against “AI-assisted bioterrorism,” and wrote “one of the first AI safety cases.”

But on Monday, he posted that it would be his last day at the company, uploading a copy of a letter he shared with colleagues. It‘s painfully devoid of specifics, but hints at at some internal tensions over the tech’s safety.

“Throughout my time here, I’ve repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,” Sharma said, claiming that employees “constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most.”

He also issued a crypic warning about the global state of affairs.

“I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons,” he wrote, “but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.”

“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,” he continued, in no less vague terms.

The resignation comes after Anthropic’s newly released Claude Cowork model helped kick off a stock market nosedive over fears that its new plugins could upend massive software customers and automate some white collar jobs, especially in legal roles.

Amid the selloff, The Telegraph reported that employees privately fretted over their own AI’s potential to hollow out the labor market.

“It kind of feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job,” one staffer said in an internal survey. “In the long term, I think AI will end up doing everything and make me and many others irrelevant,” another confided.

High profile resignations, including ones over safety issues, aren’t uncommon in the AI industry. A former member of OpenAI’s now-defunct “Superalignment” team announced he was quitting after realizing the company was “prioritizing getting out newer, shinier products” over user safety.

It’s also not uncommon that these resignations are self-exonerating advertisements for the departing employee, or perhaps the new startup they’re launching or joining, where they vow to be safer than ever. Allude to enough issues, or drop in enough loaded hints, and there’s a good chance your calling it quits will generate a few headlines.

Others leave quietly, such as former OpenAI economics researcher Tom Cunningham. Before quitting the company, he shared an internal message accusing OpenAI of turning his research team into a propaganda arm and discouraging publishing research critical of AI’s negative effects.

If Sharma has an angle here with his resignation, it doesn’t seem all that related to the industry he worked in. “I hope to explore a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech,” he wrote. In the footnotes, he cited a book that advocates for a new school of philosophy called “CosmoErotic Humanism.” Its listed author, David J Temple, is a collective pseudonym used by several authors including by Marc Gafni, a disgraced New Age spiritual guru who’s been accused of sexually exploiting his followers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, the popular social video app TikTok finalized a deal with investors, including Oracle, to appease a bipartisan bill that called on the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest — or be banned in the United States.

The deal launched a frenzy among its US-based users over possible censorship, with some accusing it of taking down footage of ICE agents or restricting searches for words, such as “Epstein.” While TikTok denied these claims, pointing to a “data center power outage,” the app also changed its privacy policy at the time — now allowing it to collect more detailed data on its users, including their precise locations.

That sparked new fears. As The New Republic argues, TikTok’s deal means that agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose deportation efforts have been supercharged under the Trump administration, could skip tedious court-ordered data requests and monitor users by buying their data from private data brokers that obtain the info from TikTok directly — a “highly ironic” development, the magazine writes, considering the ByteDance deal was motivated in the first place by fears over Chinese state-sponsored surveillance.

Users’ “Mobile Advertising ID” broadcasts their exact GPS coordinates to data brokerages, information that could then land in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, the New Republic suggested. Meanwhile, ICE could use the data to build a probabilistic “confidence score” for individuals and declare protesters and legal observers “domestic terrorists.”

It’s not an unreasonable fear. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, an extremely close ally to president Donald Trump, has even made remarks about AI ushering in an era where “citizens are on their best behavior” due to mass surveillance.

The controversial ICE is already making use of an app called ELITE, which was developed by intelligence contractor Palantir, to inform agents ahead of neighborhood raids, as 404 Media reported last month.

“One can easily imagine a scenario where TikTok provides the last missing piece of data — user location and citizenship status — that ICE needs to green-light one of its raids,” The New Republic‘s Logan McMillen wrote.

And when we asked directly, TikTok pointedly declined to provide a comment and would neither confirm nor deny that US immigration authorities were accessing data about its users. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Meanwhile, many netizens have heard enough.

“Yeah, everyone just go ahead and delete TikTok now if you haven’t already,” one user wrote.

            <h2>Elon Musk Going Through It After Putting Mars City on Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/elon-musk-spiraling-mars-city">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since at least the early 2000s, Elon Musk has been obsessed with the idea of colonizing Mars, a hostile and arid planet tens of millions of miles away.

In its earliest iteration, his plan was to refurbish an intercontinental ballistic missile to land on the Red Planet and unfurl a “Mars Oasis” — a small greenhouse that would grow plants and inspire humankind.

The greenhouse never materialized, but Musk’s ambitions steadily grew. Once he founded SpaceX, he dedicated the company to developing space travel tech to establish a self-sustaining colony on the planet. In 2017, he promised that the first Mars-bound mission would launch in 2022, with the first crewed spacecraft following two years later.

He’s clearly been personally obsessed with the idea, showing up at public events while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. He’s also heavily criticized NASA for prioritizing the Moon, calling it a “distraction.”

But over the weekend, the mercurial CEO appeared to have had a major change of heart, announcing the company’s plans to colonize Mars were officially being put on ice for at least half a decade.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted.

It’s a flabbergasting reversal, and one that Musk seems to be working through publicly on his X feed. In one opaque tweet that appeared to be missing at least one important word, Musk reflected on his current emotional state.

“Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another,” he wrote while responding to his own tweet about SpaceX building a “system that allows anyone to travel to Moon.”

“There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future,” he added. “This is one of [sic] things. Bigtime.”

It remains unclear whether he was talking about his excitement for building a city on the Moon or whether he was consoling himself over suddenly deprioritizing his decades-long dream.

Netizens on his social media network were caught off guard by the unusually glum missive.

“U ok?” reads one response, in the form of a meme.

The vast majority of the other most-liked replies pointed out that humanity was already dealing with enough problems back on Earth.

“Most people can’t afford to pay their bills, let alone even look towards the Moon,” one user wrote.

Musk, who has a long track record of imbibing in drugs like ketamine, appears to be going through it these days.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” he tweeted last week, a comment that drew little pity considering he is the richest man in the world.

Along with a slew of anti-immigrant posts, Musk has also been retweeting optimistic visualizations of what a Moon city might look like.

Rumors suggest SpaceX is planning to go public at a record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion, which could bring plenty of renewed scrutiny to Musk’s space colonization ambitions.

Perhaps he was simply trying to save face with his turn to the Moon. By massively shifting the goalposts, he could also have a better shot at attracting government contracts, which have kept SpaceX from bankruptcy since its earliest days.

For now, Mars is still technically on the table.

“That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,” Musk wrote in his announcement on Sunday.

However, SpaceX’s website currently still states that the company is “planning to launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026” — an enormously ambitious goal, considering the spacecraft has yet to successfully launch to space and stick the landing, let alone make it to anywhere past the immediate vicinity of Earth.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Samsung sent out invites Tuesday to its next Galaxy Unpacked event, scheduled for February 25 in San Francisco, where the company is expected to launch its Galaxy 26 series of smartphones.

AI features will be at the forefront again, as the company said the upcoming phones are “built to simplify everyday interactions, inspire confidence and make Galaxy AI feel seamlessly integrated from the moment it’s in hand.”

A standout feature the company has teased is a privacy display expected to debut on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.This feature will allow users to hide certain areas of the phone’s screen from onlookers to protect sensitive information. For instance, users will be able to hide the notification area from prying eyes.

Reports suggest that the top phone in the lineup will run Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon Elite Gen 5 processor in the U.S. and China. Samsung will likely opt for its own Exynos 2600 processor in other regions. The distinction matters, but increasingly less so. Snapdragon processors have historically outperformed Samsung’s Exynos chips in benchmarks and thermal efficiency, but the performance gap has been narrowing.

According to a report from the tech site SamMobile, the S26 will also have a 5,100 mAh (milliamp-hour, a standard unit of battery capacity) battery and will support 60W wired charging along and 25W wireless charging.

In addition to phones, Samsung is likely to release updated Galaxy Buds 4 wireless earbuds. The company plans to update the design from the previous generation, which drew widespread comparisons to Apple’s AirPods.

The event will begin at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET/ 7 PM CET, and will be streamed live on Samsung’s website and its YouTube channel.

Samsung is offering a $30 promotional credit to anyone who pre-registers interest it its upcoming devices. Pre-registering is merely an expression of interest; consumers will still get the credit as a discount toward other Samsung products even if they don’t end up buying the new devices. If you pre-register and then pre-order one of the devices, the company will increase that to a $150 credit — no trade-in required.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/with-co-founders-leaving-and-an-ipo-looming-elon-musk-turns-talk-to-the-moon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.

According to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. “You have to go to the moon,” he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

What Musk didn’t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. “If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”

It isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.

The moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX’s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had “shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,” arguing that a Mars colony would take “20+ years.” The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.

It’s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.

Rationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that’s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren’t a distraction from xAI’s core mission; they’re inseparable from it.

The theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world’s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.

Whether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation — and by extension, no company — can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole — while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it.

As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,” she said. “Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.”

That legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk’s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, for now at least, the team to help him get there keeps getting smaller.

            <div id="article-text">Ryan Beiermeister, who served as OpenAI’s vice president of product policy, was fired in January after a male colleague accused her of sex discrimination, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” Beiermeister told the Journal. TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for comment and also contacted an email that appears to be associated with Beiermeister; neither had responded at the time of publication.

Per the Journal’s report, Beiermeister’s termination came after she expressed criticism of a planned ChatGPT feature dubbed “adult mode.” The new mode would introduce erotica into the chatbot user experience. Fidji Simo, who serves as OpenAI’s CEO of Applications — a role overseeing the company’s consumer-facing products — has told reporters that the new feature is planned to launch during the first quarter of this year.

Beiermeister and others at the company have raised concerns about how the new “adult” feature could potentially impact certain users, according to the report.

OpenAI reportedly said that Beiermeister, who was fired following a leave of absence, had “made valuable contributions during her time at OpenAI, and her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”

Beiermeister’s LinkedIn profile says she previously worked for four years on Meta’s product team and spent more than seven years working for Palantir.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Monday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

Less than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. “Enormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” it read in part.

On their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company’s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.

By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.

There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering — the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.

Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn’t slowing down, and if Grok can’t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.

In short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.

            <div id="article-text">The AI industry’s pursuit of licensable content has been a messy affair, filled with lawsuits and accusations of copyright infringement. Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.

The Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.

Reached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.”

Amazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.

The move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.

Those efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.

Media publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries — particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results — may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a “devastating” impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information’s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a “more sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue” as AI usage continues to escalate.

            <h2>An ice dance duo skated to AI music at the Olympics</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/olympics-czech-ice-dancers-duo-ai-music/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Czech ice dancers Kateřina Mrázková and Daniel Mrázek made their Olympic debut on Monday, an unfathomable feat that takes a lifetime of dedication and practice. But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.

As Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.

The Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.

But, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.

Per the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, the duo’s music choice for the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics website confirms that the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.

ok I know this is an art account but I have been seething about this ever since Shana Bartel caught it and wrote about it in her blog (which you should be reading it’s very good – link below) and I just NEEDED to get it out of me.  https://www.patreon.com/posts/142706982?utm_campaign=postshare_fan&utm_content=android_share #icedance #icedancing #figureskating #IceSkating #plagiarism

The Czech siblings have faced backlash before for using AI-generated music. Earlier in the season, they played a ’90s-inspired song for their routine that began with a wailing declaration: “Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz!” If that sounds familiar, it’s because that lyric comes directly from the ’90s hit “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals (which, by the way, has an incredible music video shot in a Staten Island mall — the true essence of American suburbia!).

The AI-generated lyrics also include the lines, “Wake up, kids/We got the dreamer’s disease,” and “First we run, and then we laugh ’til we cry.” What a coincidence! Those lyrics also appear in the song “You Get What You Give” by New Radicals. The AI song is even titled “One Two,” which are the first words of… you can probably guess which song at this point.

Before the Olympics, the duo changed the song, swapping out the New Radicals lyrics for other AI-generated lyrics that sound suspiciously like Bon Jovi lyrics, as journalist Shana Bartels noted in November. For example, “raise your hands, set the night on fire” also appear in “Raise Your Hands” by Bon Jovi… and the AI “vocalist” sounds a lot like Bon Jovi, too. (Not to pour salt on the wound, but “Raise Your Hands” isn’t even from the ’90s!) This was the music that the duo danced to on Monday at the Olympics, before it transitioned into “Thunderstruck” by AC/DC, a real song from the ’90s written by real people.

While it’s unclear what software the team used to generate this music, this is an LLM operating as it’s supposed to. These LLMs are trained on large libraries of music, often through legally dubious means. When prompted, LLMs produce the most statistically probable response to an input. That’s useful when writing code, but means a song “in the style of Bon Jovi,” will likely end up using some actual Bon Jovi lyrics.

And yet, the music industry seems at least temporarily enamored with the idea of “musicians” who aren’t totally real. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to set her (hopefully real) poetry to music under the persona Xania Monet. Now she has a $3 million record deal.

It’s a shame that these Czech dancers’ accomplishment of skating at the Olympics may be marred by discourse around their use of AI music (discourse that I am actively contributing to). But come on! Isn’t this sport supposed to be creative?

            <h2>The March for Billionaires Was a Funeral for Irony</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/march-for-billionaires-silicon-valley-ai/685957/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of weeks ago, word began to spread around San Francisco that somebody was organizing a “March for Billionaires.” A mystery organizer had posted on social media that “billionaires get a bad rap,” and soon, some flyers appeared around the city. A website provided a time and rendezvous point; it also celebrated the societal contributions of Jeff Bezos and Taylor Swift, exhorting people to “judge individuals, not classes.” The message seemed to be: Not all billionaires.

Initially, everybody I asked in the city was certain that this was satire, perhaps the workings of Sacha Baron Cohen or a stunt by union activists; after all, the website also lauds the value created by James Dyson, Roger Federer, and the CEO of Chobani (for having “popularized Greek yogurt”). I was reminded of how, several years ago, the faux-conspiracists of the Birds Aren’t Real movement rallied outside Twitter’s headquarters to critique dangerous social-media rabbit holes.

Still, in a city where AI founders are giddy about automating entire industries and selling digital “friends,” and in a state that is weighing a new and aggressive tax for its wealthiest residents, I wasn’t so sure. The March for Billionaires website appeared to have thoroughly obscured the ownership of its domain, so I contacted one of the march’s social-media accounts last week and quickly received a response: The organizer would meet me for coffee.

His name is Derik Kauffman, and he seemed very serious. The protest was the first that Kauffman, a 26-year-old AI-start-up founder, had organized. “I’m someone who stands up for what I believe in,” he told me over coffee (well, he ordered a green juice). “Even if that’s unpopular.” For an hour, as I did my best to prod Kauffman’s sincerity, he did not flinch. He is not against social welfare, agreed that poverty is bad, and at one point launched into a detailed discussion of tax loopholes exploited by the ultrarich. Still, although not a billionaire himself, Kauffman is a fanboy. He said that he’d organized the march with both a specific goal—opposing the wealth tax on billionaires in California proposed by a major health-care workers’ union—and a broader one: to spread the word that billionaires are ultimately friends of the working class. His thinking was contradictory at times but extensive; if this was a hoax, the execution was quite good.

And so, on Saturday, a group of like-minded dissidents gathered with him in Pacific Heights, home to San Francisco’s “Billionaires’ Row,” to lend the nation’s 924 wealthiest people their support. The event topped out, by my count, at 18 pro-billionaire attendees, who hoisted signs with slogans such as Tip Your Landlord and Property Rights Are Human Rights. At least 15 counterprotesters showed up as well, making everything more confusing because they were parodying the idea of supporting billionaires. Some wore full suits or elaborate dresses and held Trillionaires for Trump signs; others offered pulled-pork sandwiches labeled Musk à la Guillotine and chanted “Eat the poor.” Reporters and photographers outnumbered both groups handily.

The proposed “billionaire tax” is a onetime tax on billionaires to make up for federal cuts to California’s health-care budget. Fears about the tax rose after The Wall Street Journal reported that Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the co-founders of Google, were considering leaving the state. The threat of this or any future billionaire tax, Kauffman said, could damage the entrepreneurship that makes California great. (An eclectic set of wealthy and influential figures in the state, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, the White House AI adviser David Sacks, and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel, oppose the initiative.)

Beyond pushing back against any particular policy, the march was also taking a moral stand. “Billionaires are often vilified,” Pablo, one of the demonstrators, told me. “In terms of people appreciating them or just not hating them, they are probably among the worst off in the whole world.” Another, Flo, suggested to me that anti-billionaire sentiment is “growing in left circles” and needs to be resisted. None of the pro-billionaire marchers I spoke with other than Kauffman would tell me their surname.

There is, of course, truth to the statement that billionaires are reviled. A recent Harris Poll survey found that nearly three-quarters of Americans believe that billionaires are too celebrated; more than half believe that billionaires are a threat to democracy. (The march’s timing on the heels of the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which feature a number of billionaires, is hard to ignore.) As the procession walked toward City Hall, along streets known for upper-end shopping and dining, pedestrians, bikers, drivers, and people seated outside for brunch booed, jeered, and honked; one store owner came out, filmed the march, and called its participants “billionaire brownnosers.” Matt, one of two people holding the large banner at the front of the procession (Billionaires Build Prosperity), told me that he was marching in part because “I try to make a habit of doing one courageous thing a day.”

Perhaps now is a good time for some context: The top 0.1 percent of Americans control 14.4 percent of the nation’s wealth, nearly six times that of the bottom 50 percent. The 400 wealthiest individuals pay a smaller portion of their income in taxes than the average American. The disparity is even more pronounced in Silicon Valley, where nine households control 15 percent of the region’s wealth and the top 0.1 percent control 71 percent of its wealth, according to an analysis from San José State University. The same Harris Poll survey that captured Americans’ hostility toward billionaires also found that 60 percent of respondents wanted to become billionaires themselves.

Any attempt at a debate with Kauffman or the other pro-billionaire demonstrators—to suggest that immense wealth inequality is harmful and that the market does not, on its own, allow many Americans to get by, let alone thrive—always boiled down to the same, unshakable belief: Billionaires are the engine of the U.S. economy, and because people pay for goods on Amazon and use Google Search, billionaires’ fortunes are deserved. If Amazon causes brick-and-mortar stores to close, it’s simply because those stores “weren’t providing as much” value to consumers, Mike, a protester, told me. Never mind the low wages, acquisition of competitors, price manipulation, and other practices many billionaires use to stay on top.

For all the spectacle, the tensions between the pro- and faux-billionaires were sharp and reflective of real animosity. As the main procession chanted “Property rights are human rights,” Vincent Gargiulo, a counterprotester dressed in a white mock-billionaire suit, began shouting “Fuck poor people.” Things briefly escalated as a demonstrator confronted Gargiulo for being “not sincere.” He grabbed and snapped her pro-billionaire sign. Then Kauffman approached and threatened to call the police unless Gargiulo left. Another pro-billionaire demonstrator eventually snatched the sign back. “I am offended that there’s a march to support people who are making money that I will never see in my entire life,” Gargiulo told me when I asked why he had broken character. The next chant in defense of the wealthy was “End the class war!”

As the march progressed, something odd began to happen between the countervailing messages. The two sides—representing, I suppose, the 0.01 percent and the rest of us, respectively—almost melded together. Kauffman blared, “Thank you, California billionaires” through his megaphone, and the counterprotesters, wearing crowns, shouted back, “You’re welcome.” As they approached City Hall, where the group would deliver some speeches, the pro-billionaire rally cheered, “Abolish public land” while the counterprotesters jeered, “Tip your landlord,” a slogan that was itself on one of the pro-billionaire posters. At one point, both sides chanted “Poverty should not exist” in unison—the marchers suggesting that billionaires will alleviate poverty, the counterprotesters either trying to reclaim the statement or simply playing into its absurdity.

It was, in a way, a fitting blend. Wealth disparities and unaffordability are among several crises that tech companies are simultaneously contributing to and selling solutions for. (Every pro-billionaire attendee I spoke with described themselves as in tech or “tech adjacent” fields.) Silicon Valley is dizzyingly self-contradictory. Top CEOs have aligned themselves with a xenophobic White House while relying heavily on an immigrant workforce. AI companies offer products that claim to improve the economy by automating large swaths of it. Billboards around San Francisco advertise a product that conducts audits before your AI girlfriend breaks up with you; founders are earnest about curing death. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and other tech leaders post like teenage boys while making society-altering decisions. Everything is ironic, and nothing is.

As the march neared its destination, we passed by an Amazon delivery driver standing outside his van. He was filming the procession, and I approached to ask what he thought of it all. His English was limited, and he seemed a bit confused by what was going on at first, saying that he supported the march—as in, protesting in general. I explained that the march was in support of the likes of Bezos and Musk. Did he support billionaires? “No, no,” he clarified. “Everybody has to get more money. Everybody, not only one person.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legal scholars sometimes bemoan what they call the “CSI effect”—the tendency, in courtrooms, for jurors’ familiarity with true-crime TV shows to skew their expectations of how crimes are investigated and solved. The effect emerges from a paradox: People’s interest in televised versions of the criminal-justice system can, regardless of their compassion or sympathies, impede justice in the real world.

The disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, an unsolved mystery playing out in real time, embodies a similar paradox. The 84-year-old—the mother of the Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie—has been missing since February 1, when her failure to attend church services triggered a wide-ranging and, as the days have worn on, ever more desperate search. What seems clear at this point, and what law-enforcement officers say they have determined, is that Nancy was taken from her home near Tucson, Arizona, against her will. Today, investigators released a video recovered from her entryway camera, showing a person—masked, gloved, carrying what appears to be a holstered gun—at her door during the hours of the assumed abduction. The video may be a break in a case that has captured national attention both despite and because of all the questions it has left unanswered. Among them: Where is Nancy Guthrie? What condition is she in? Is her disappearance connected to the fact that her daughter is a celebrity?

The open questions, and the narrative that has risen around them, have turned Nancy herself into something of a celebrity. Her fate has become a matter of feverish national interest, and her abduction a shock that, as it enters its second week, has remained front-page, broadcast-leading news. Its smallest details have been shared on purpose-built live blogs, rehashed through ad hoc podcasts, and discussed endlessly on social media—as melodramas, as cliffhangers, as plot twists. This is the CSI effect at its broadest and most reductive. Nancy’s disappearance, as a human circumstance—a grandmother taken from her house in the middle of the night, held by someone unknown—is unthinkable. As a story, though, the case’s dynamics are all too familiar. Public interest changes the terms of any tragedy. The longer this one has gone on, the more its horrors have hewed to the demands of the show.

This is, to a degree, because of the particulars of the case. Nancy’s disappearance, in addition to playing out as television, has also played out through television. People claiming to be her kidnappers have allegedly communicated with the Guthrie family through notes sent to TV stations. (The gossip site TMZ also said that it had received a note, making it something of a character in the unfolding drama.) And the family has responded, addressing the presumed kidnappers through, at least in part, their own small productions—videos that Savannah and her two siblings have posted publicly, pleading for their mother’s safe return. The messages embody the same split-screen reality as many other elements of the case: Their ostensible aim is to bring things to a conclusion, but each new post—see, for example, the one that Savannah, this time solo, posted yesterday—also adds to the spectacle, providing fodder for viewers and narrative momentum.

Attention can be a blessing and a curse. Statements posted by Savannah explicitly ask for the public’s help in locating Nancy. (NBC, which broadcasts Today, has shared with its audience the FBI’s tip line and the phone number of the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.) And public interest in private tragedies can sometimes lead to clues and insights that might otherwise have eluded law-enforcement officials working alone. The murder of the vlogger Gabby Petito, for example, was solved with the help of social-media users who, following the case from afar, found the crucial clues.

But public interest has also, arguably, made the Guthrie case more difficult to parse than it might otherwise have been. Officials have received multiple letters claiming to be ransom notes—and seem to have spent much of their time attempting to discern which, if any, might be authentic, and which might be the work of hoaxers. (Last week, federal authorities arrested a man who they allege contacted members of the Guthrie family via text message with what seems like a ransom demand. According to the complaint against him, the man, after being read his Miranda rights, admitted to having sent two messages.)

Whatever its direct costs and benefits to an investigation, public interest also comes with broader complications. The Guthrie case, like so many before it, has attracted its own coterie of self-professed “experts”—people who assess the situation from a distance, analyzing the meager evidence available to them and speculating about the victim’s fate. Some seem well intentioned in their interest; having learned of the case, they are following it—participating in it—in the hope that it might have a happy ending. Others seem more craven; understanding that tragedies are also trending topics, they have found new ways to transform public concern into personal clout.

Some commenters, meanwhile, live out the full paradox of the made-for-TV saga: Their sympathy, soon enough, gives way to the needs of the show. Reddit boards hosting discussions of the case offer grim evidence of the concession. Many people come to the story—the missing woman, the panicked family, the ordeal so singular but relatable—expressing compassion. But compassion, once expressed, has nowhere else to go. Instead, some posters might offer theories about what happened, what didn’t, what evidence might have been withheld. A few might escalate into wild speculation: that the suspected abduction was an “inside job,” that it was committed by a drug cartel, that it is related to the fact that Savannah Guthrie, in her work as an NBC journalist, has covered the Epstein files.

Versions of this escalation are familiar features of many sites—platforms that offer people incentives, social and financial and otherwise, to edge toward extremism. Reddit abhors a vacuum. And the conversations it hosts, on their own, do little to affect the case; they are, for the most part, idle chatter. But their trajectories—the ease with which they transform compassion into conspiracism—hint at an everyday tragedy lurking within an exceptional one: the fact that empathy and exploitation are never as distant as they might seem. Attention is currency, in some ways the truest and most valuable we have to give. When one family’s nightmare becomes nationally syndicated, though, attention can become a demand—for more detail, for more drama, for a cathartic conclusion. The vigil can come to look like voyeurism, the human care made crass. What is the difference between feeling someone’s pain and consuming it? From the distance of the screen, it can become all too hard to tell.</div>

            <h2>What the Crypto Crash Reveals About Trump's Power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/trump-crypto-market-crash/685959/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

During the summer of his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made a vow to the cryptocurrency industry: Elect him, and the United States would become the “crypto capital of the planet.” That winter, after crypto-industry donations helped secure Trump’s place in the White House, digital assets began appreciating rapidly—and the president-elect was glad to take the credit. When bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark, he simply posted, “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!”

For a sense of just how much money has evaporated from the crypto industry since then, look to bitcoin. On October 6, the price of a single bitcoin climbed to an all-time high north of $126,000; today, its value is closer to $69,000. The global market capitalization of all coins has shed more than $2 trillion in that time, and fewer and fewer traders are dabbling in meme coins and derivatives. Following a relatively fruitful 2025, crypto-venture-capital deals have fallen off a cliff over the past few months. Commentators have now started to wonder whether the president, who has spent the past two years positioning himself as the industry’s protector and hype man, might initiate a crypto bailout.

But wasn’t Trump’s election already a kind of bailout? His explicit promise on the campaign trail was that America would lead the way, but his implicit promise was that prices would go up. Since taking office, Trump has established himself as the face of crypto through his flagrant promotional tactics (remember those limited-edition bitcoin-orange sneakers?), his sweeping deregulation efforts, and, of course, his family’s investments in digital assets. The Trumps have now made hundreds of millions of dollars from cryptocurrencies, according to recent estimates. Despite these links, crypto’s fate isn’t solely tied to the Trumps. There’s no single cause for the current downturn, but it demonstrates that a president’s intervention—even intervention as consistent as Trump’s—can only do so much to keep cryptocurrencies afloat.

Throughout its 17 years, bitcoin has been defined by cycles—booms and busts that are sometimes explicable and sometimes not. This volatility is part of why the president himself once thought of bitcoin as a “scam.” It is driven both by an inbuilt technical feature called “halving” (which I will stop myself from explaining but is worth digging into if you’re so inclined) and by the natural waxing and waning of global attention. The year 2021 gave us a historic bubble, fueled in part by venture-capital funding and NFTs. The bubble popped in 2022 thanks to the unraveling of two crypto kingpins, Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried, and the ensuing regulatory crackdown. After that came a deep freeze of investment activity, a so-called crypto winter, and a slow but steady recovery. Trump’s 2024 “crypto capital” remark arrived as the sector was starting to wake from hibernation. Morale was, if not quite as low as it is right now, nowhere near where it had been a few years prior. The crypto optimism of Trump’s election probably helped boost prices, but it was not a guaranteed buffer against all future instability.

The president’s public support of the industry is inextricable from his family’s personal investments. The Trumps’ empire encompasses the crypto firms World Liberty Financial and American Bitcoin, as well as the crypto-adjacent Trump Media & Technology Group, which at one point held about $2 billion worth of bitcoin. There are also the meme coins $TRUMP and $MELANIA, the first of which made the president a crypto billionaire just before his inauguration and has since lost about 95 percent of its value.

The administration has also made life easier for crypto more broadly, championing industry-backed regulations such as the GENIUS Act, a new framework for stablecoins that was signed into law this past summer. It has also, separately, dropped Joe Biden–era investigations into major firms. The White House is now packed with crypto devotees, including the venture capitalist David Sacks, who now serves as special adviser for AI and crypto, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has dubbed Trump the “crypto president.” Together, this team has worked to establish a crypto-forward White House, most notably by creating a “strategic bitcoin reserve.”

These moves probably accelerated the real gains that crypto was making throughout the majority of 2025. But those gains weren’t entirely attributable to Trump, either. Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have cropped up in BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds and in mainstream brokerage apps. A side effect of crypto’s integration with existing financial institutions is that bitcoin has started to trade like an ordinary tech stock: Bitcoin’s rise last year coincided with the broader momentum of the tech industry. The fact that it’s now crashing doesn’t necessarily suggest a complete decoupling (parts of tech, particularly software stocks, are getting crushed right now), but the downtrend is a reminder that crypto is governed by more than just Silicon Valley earnings calls. Plus, the industry is still more international than Trump might like it to be; prices are determined by traders all over the world.

A crypto-friendly White House was never going to be a panacea, but the scale of the recent crash is remarkable. The global crypto market capitalization—that is, the approximate value of all of its tokens—has entirely erased the gains it made since Trump’s inauguration, despite this supposed regulatory golden age. If Democrats return to power in 2028, they aren’t likely to share this administration’s permissive attitude. And those commentators musing about whether Trump would bail out crypto are likely to be disappointed. When asked in a congressional hearing last week whether the administration would direct private banks to purchase more bitcoin, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted that the government has no authority to do so.

Bitcoin was once envisioned as an alternative to a corrupt system—something entirely independent from governments and big banks. In 2026, the most powerful politicians and financiers in the world have gone all-in. An asset that was once anti-system has now effectively become the system. There’s no question that this has benefited crypto in some ways. (For one, institutional adoption has made it more resilient; crypto is not beyond recovery, and it will probably bounce back.) But because no one actor has unilateral control over the sector’s future, the prices of these coins remain as fickle as ever.

Trump has long embraced the notion that he has the power to solve even the most intractable problems. He famously told voters in 2016 that the system is broken and that “I alone can fix it.” But volatility is inherent to crypto; not even the “crypto president” can fix that.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

The appointment of a new medicine man is a dicey moment in the life of a tribe. Get it wrong, pick the wrong guy, and your deepest spiritual diseases will go not only untreated but undetected. Get it right, and there’s at least a chance of an accurate diagnosis. The Victorians, rather surprisingly, got it right. In fact, for all their pomposity and stolidity and leadenness of soul, and for all their windbag religiosity, they nailed it. They chose as their national poet a vagrant and depressed semi-atheist from a family of lunatics. They chose Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

Tennyson was already famous, largely on the strength of his blockbuster elegy, In Memoriam, when Queen Victoria made him her poet laureate in 1850. But it is with the haunted and chaotic pre-fame poet—the shaggy, craggy, germinal genius wandering in his cloud of tobacco smoke and melancholy, poring over his books about physics and chemistry—that Richard Holmes’s The Boundless Deep is chiefly concerned. Subtitled Young Tennyson, Science, and the Crisis of Belief, it tracks this character’s metabolic absorption of the most disturbing, displacing ideas that contemporary science had to offer; their effect on his personality; and their manifestation in his poetry.

Watch. A new adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel, Wuthering Heights, captures the story’s grotesque beauty, David Sims writes.

Read. If anyone could write good fiction about America’s immigration debate, it would probably be Lionel Shriver—instead, her latest novel goes off the rails, Adelle Waldman argues.

            <h2>Trump’s Gaza Plans Are Profoundly Unserious</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/trump-gaza-real-estate/685948/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump has extravagant plans for the Gaza Strip. The only problem is that they bear no connection to the grim realities on the ground—nor is there much prospect that the two will align in the foreseeable future.

Trump has declared that the cease-fire in Gaza—such as it is, given that Hamas continues to attack Israeli forces, and Israeli strikes continue to kill Palestinians—has now entered Phase 2. But the only sign of progress has been Israel’s agreement to reopen the small crossing between Gaza and Egypt for individual Palestinians seeking medical care or other necessities. And that development came mainly in response to the recovery of the body of the final Israeli hostage held in Gaza, rather than from any plan of Trump’s.

Washington has, in fact, unveiled an elaborate “master plan” for the reconstruction of Gaza. It is profoundly unserious. It promises industrial parks, educational centers, residential zones, and beach resorts, likely inspired by cities such as Dubai and Singapore. But those cities evolved through decades of careful urban planning. Gaza is, at the moment, a rubbled wasteland. Approximately 80 percent of all structures have been badly damaged or destroyed, and Gazans have nowhere to live except in squalid tents or the ruins of former homes.

Read: The Trump administration has a new plan for Gaza

Any serious reconstruction plan would have to begin by providing for the urgent needs of more than 2 million Palestinians, which include housing, food, and potable water, as well as basic health and education services. Instead, the Trump plan imagines “coastal tourism” towers; “industrial complex data centers” and “advanced manufacturing,” an airport, a port, trains, parks, and “agriculture and sports facilities.”

The fantasy is beguiling, and its realization would be a magnificent accomplishment—if it weren’t so unimaginably absurd. Trump’s master plan treats Gaza as if it were a greenfield site rather than a partitioned pile of wreckage populated by destitute, hungry, unsheltered people. The plan also totally disregards the historical and religious sites in the Strip. If it all sounds like a real-estate developer’s fantasy run amok, that’s because it is. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has assumed a major role in the project, has breezily conceded that the plan presumes conditions contrary to fact—a demilitarized Hamas and an end to the Strip’s parition—but that “we do not have a Plan B.” In other words, reconstruction in Gaza will remain a cruel diplomatic pantomime, while millions of people huddle in tents waiting for the next humanitarian aid box.

In addition to being physically destroyed, Gaza is now partitioned between two hostile, armed entities. The Israeli military officially controls 53 percent of the Strip, and unofficially a bit more, and a resurgent Hamas runs the rest. The eastern, Israeli-controlled side of the dividing “yellow line” is now virtually unpopulated and contains most of Gaza’s arable land. The western, Hamas-controlled area consists mainly of demolished cities and towns and sandy beaches—as well as almost the entire Palestinian population.

Phase 2 of the Gaza cease-fire agreement was supposed to involve the introduction of an international stabilization force and a technocratic Palestinian governance committee. But no international force has yet been deployed, and the governance committee that has been appointed is largely powerless. Moreover, neither Israel nor Hamas has any interest in allowing such an entity to actually run Gaza.

That’s in part because the committee members are reportedly aligned with Fatah, which is locked in a zero-sum political power struggle with the heavily armed Hamas. At best, Hamas might seek to maintain its armed forces behind this technocratic cover. In such a scenario, Hamas, rather like Hezbollah in Lebanon, would remain the key decision maker in Gaza.

But even that may be optimistic. Israel, too, is leery of strengthening Fatah, which already dominates the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Palestine Liberation Organization internationally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies have long sought to keep Hamas in power in Gaza, though contained and periodically battered, and Fatah in control of only small, self-ruled areas of the West Bank. Netanyahu has openly embraced a divide-and-conquer strategy for blocking any possibility of Palestinian statehood, likely in the ultimate pursuit of annexing the West Bank.

And so both parties in control of Gaza seem to be hunkering down for the current yellow-line cease-fire to become semipermanent. Israel will hold an election sometime between May and October; a new government could change the equation. So could greater seriousness on the parts of Trump, Kushner, and the so-called Board of Peace (which includes such noted peacemakers as Netanyahu and the Belarusian strongman Aleksander Lukashenko, but no Palestinians).

Then again, Trump specializes in announcing supposedly major diplomatic initiatives that grab headlines but signify nothing. Virtually everything he’s touting in Gaza—the international stabilization force, the master plan, the Board of Peace, the technocratic governance committee—amounts to little more than a Kabuki show, utterly divorced from the gruesome realities in the Strip.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/daily-trivia-questions-answers-week-17/685936/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">Updated with new questions at 12:55 p.m. ET on February 10, 2026.

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

Find previous questions here, and to get Atlantic Trivia in your inbox every day, sign up for The Atlantic Daily.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

Hoping to get around the ghostly city? Enjoy your ride in a white car; darkly colored cars are outlawed. You can head to the airport modeled on a flying white falcon, or to the world’s largest enclosed Ferris wheel, made of white steel. There is also the massive (white) Palace of Happiness, which can accommodate seven weddings at once. And in case you were wondering, brides in the country typically wear—got you here!—red.

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.</div>

... too complex bloatware for instant messaging wants personal information? i smell big brother, and since i am irl big brother, one is enough.

Plus nitro. They&#39;ve been mad at pushing nitro everywhere. Makes you want to vomit every time you see it.

Most countries that introduced age verification requirements state that verification must be &quot;highly effective&quot;. Would this predictive profiling be enough in the court of law?

It&#39;s probably stuff like the age of the account. If it&#39;s 10 years old, the chance that the owner is under 13 and registered it as a toddler is quite small. If they have made purchases with a credit card, or linked a phone number to it, that sort of thing.

We&#39;ve covered the accuracy of predictive profiling time and time again. The amount of insight you can gain from someone&#39;s behaviour is truly immense. Remember the case of Target being criticised for sending pregnancy related products to a teen girl based purely on purchasing behaviour, only for it later to come out that she was pregnant despite her not telling anyone?

Highly effective is a word distinct from &quot;perfect&quot;. I think it would be an easy bar to pass algorithmically given the information platforms sl

... than yet another glorified and way overrated IRC/XChat clone like Slack or other candidates - will only take me a few minutes. As soon as they get more annoying than convenient I&#39;m out. For all I care they might as well just go broke already, since they&#39;re still not profitable. No need to try to gain any mass by starting this uber-surveillance thing. It won&#39;t pan out anyway, so they might aswell just give up.

My daughter plays Roblox. They are asking her to take a selfie to get assigned to an age group.

https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/... [roblox.com]

Seriously, they are planning to use some AI doodad to place you into a group &quot;Your estimated age helps place you in the appropriate age group (5-8, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, and 21+) to customize your experience on Roblox&quot;. I&#39;ve known people that have baby faces in their 30&#39;s, and I&#39;ve seen preteens that have started showing off beard. And this is all based on some image recognition thingamajick?

Most countries at least in EU have some sort of governmental identity mechanism, that allows you to make strong identification to any service. Why does this have to be some sort of AI magic that steals your data, when this all could be handled by a simple federated identity tokens. Just go to your government site, ask it to generate a signed token that states &quot;On this day, holder of this token is X years of age&quot;, lifetime of token can be like 15 minutes. No need for government to learn what were you visiting and no need for the service to know all other details either.

They are already utilizing some third party to do the selfie recognition and evaluation, why couldn&#39;t the same third party pass a token between gov website and the service with the same price?

No method (regardless how clever) and solve the root problem: A child can ask its 18 year old friend to unlock the account.You can find ways to prove age, but there are no reasonable ways to prove the current user is the person who proved to be 18+

At least the video-thing. They stated processing locally only and nothing about storage. That means, at least in Europe, they are not legally allowed to do any storage and they must keep the data local or being in direct, non-accidental violation of the GDPR. Fines go up to 5% of annual global (!) turnover and, for repeat offenders, a prohibition to process or store any personal data.

Now, I have zero trust in their integrity or honor. But people will be looking and exfiltrating that video data or storing it

Now every user needs to think about if they behave like an underage user.Better not login at times pupils have free time. Login early on holiday days to prove that you&#39;re not a child sleeping long at the day off. Make sure not to click like on silly memes. Join some servers that look boring to kids.That&#39;s just another way to make users self-censor.

You know, when you put it like that I realize Discord might be massively improved if users are given incentive not to act like they&#39;re underage and immature.

..are always a bit unevenIt takes a while for stability to mature

Yeah, I guess, it is a bit uneven and unstable if it leaves you free time.

The even and stable implementation when it arrives will work like that ole Matrix, you&#39;ll be born plugged in and working overtime while receiving false dreams to keep you happy - until you&#39;re worn off and they flush you out.

I just found out the most interesting thing I can do with copilot at work: turn it off. In VS code, the bottom right copilot button has a &quot;snooze&quot; option. I use it because inserted garbage comments break my train of thought.

I don&#39;t say it&#39;s not useful. But it does drive me nuts sometimes.

has been utter shit for decades. It glorifies overtime over everything else - including over metrics that could be improved with less overtime, such as quality and efficiency.

AI is just more of the same: turbocharged shit.

I&#39;m saying this as an American expat living in Europe and actually having a quality of life and work/life balance I never had stateside.

Itâ(TM)s not privilegeâ¦itâ(TM)s a choice that requires effort and work to unlock. Itâ(TM)s a lot easier than most people think.

Disclaimer: former US American citizen turned European here

The system and culture in the US is pretty broken in key parts, that&#39;s for sure. Europe is aging and has a demographic bomb coming up, but by and large quality of living is higher by default these days. Healthcare, safety nets and a (somewhat) sane system of taxation are all part of this. I hope any US revolution that might be upcoming will be peaceful and that some basics will be factory-reset to some saner defaults.

The employees&#39; to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.This phrase implies that AI made them more efficient (and the only problem they had was to have realistic limitations).

The employees&#39; to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.

This phrase implies that AI made them more efficient (and the only problem they had was to have realistic limitations).

Be thanked for being more productive by getting more tasks. Then wonder why you burn out, when you do 100 things fast instead of 10 slow.

Echos of this have been around in the past.  The computer allowed people to get a lot more done, so they spent more time on it.  Same with the Internet.  When you have a tool that is a force multiplier, you want to hit the gas on it and see what it can do.

This is normal.  In the past, force multipliers for me have been getting a central Git system in place, a central documentation system, a ticket system, from there working with reports.  AI helps accelerate that even more.

So they&#39;re rediscovering what any artist who create for a living has learned - you can&#39;t produce good work all the time by the hour.

... Chillout time. No joke. My productivity has gone 5x in the last 6 months, especially with the newest models and them spitting out boring but maintainable boilerplate code for me and explaining the details of what they&#39;re doing, but overall my life has become more chill. I&#39;ve started taking naps at noon when I&#39;m in homeoffice.

Then again, I&#39;m an experienced senior webdev, the new product we&#39;re building has is architecture 100% designed and maintained by me alone and with AI I basically have a team 5 junio

That&#39;s the point, but not always what they achieve. Abstractions are always well intended but rarely well done.

The news has been filled with articles about companies proclaiming how they are going all in on AI.I wonder how long until we see the first articles about companies proclaiming they are ditching AI and the benefits / competitive advantage they seek to reap from doing so?

Ah, would that be Greenland you&#39;re thinking of?

Even if their island becomes 100% hostile to all life, the Icelanders can always power artificial life with the free energy they&#39;re blessed with: the uninterrupted source of heat coming from the bowels of the Earth.

They&#39;re in a quasi-unique position of not really having to worry about climate change, if worse comes to worst.

Right. Meanwhile down in the tropics they could just use the free energy from the sun to power the A/C if the heat becomes too extreme.

Were you born this stupid or do you have to practice at it?

Global warming is going to make things colder?In some areas, yes.  Global warming will destabilize existing wind, weather, and ocean currents into new patterns.  Some places will loose their current heating and cooling sources.Drain the Chesapeake Bay and see what happens to the weather around Washington DC and Baltimore.  Drain Puget Sound and see what happens to Seattle.  Flowing ocean water can have a stabilizing effect on the land area near them.Stop the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the warm water that keeps Iceland temperate will stop and no longer be a stabilizing source.  Iceland would get colder and the AMOC current would turn to new locations.  There are several models that show the best guess of what would happen but suffice it to say it would change weather patterns for numerous locations.

_And_ other places will get hotter, as less heat is transported away by the AMOC. So those places may become uninhabitable by being so hot and humid that humans will just overheat and die from heat stroke.

... northern Europe and the northern Atlantic in the unique position of becoming the earths new coldest point on earth. Iceland would be affected, as would Scandinavia, Germany and some other regions. Given that Germany enjoys a relatively moderate climate considering its latitude position on the globe these assumptions are plausible. If the gulf stream goes away, Germany will get colder.

As mentioned, that is pretty unique, globally speaking.

Global warming is going to make things colder?Yes, potentially. The effects of global warming on AMOC and the consequences have been explored in the scientific literature since the 1970s.

A country looks into the future and sees something bleak. Then they begin to plan for it.

Imagine how stupid they would be if they just denied it, turned a blind eye, and then actively attempted to accelerate directly toward it.

This is practically a stereotypical AI use - look for associations in a massive database, inducing a formula from that data and then reversing the process to deduce a conclusion based on new data.

It is rather obvious that bone structure should both affect one&#39;s voice and also be observable via a picture, but at the same time involve such massive calculations that humans would be surprised by it.

&quot;Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.&quot;

&quot;Global warming is the fever, mankind is the virus.&quot;

Not an expert in this area. But apparently it is a thing. Funnily enough the feature they are worried about is actually a security attack... ha ha. Welp, this cat is out of the bag unfortunately, so now just the criminals will have it.1.

It says in the summary that you can upload audio as well. Bytedance actually demonstrated the audio bit years ago. They had about 10 seconds of speech, and from that it could extrapolate a reasonably believable artificial voice. Scammers have been using the tech for years.

Black guy: Ving Rhames voice, or else Flava FlaveGuy with big nose: thick Yiddish accentAsian: gong sounds in backgroundWeak chin: &quot;I SAY, old chap!&quot;Woman: whiny and complaining, or else submissive and apologeticKid with crew cut: &quot;Gee Willikers, Mr!&quot;Guy with long hair: &quot;Dude...&quot;etc. Do we really need phrenological explanations when good old stereotypes can get us 99% of the way there in explaining how amazing this feature must be?

It&#39;s a voluntary compact. It won&#39;t impact anything

Nonsense, it will impact el Bunko&#39;s bottom line. &quot;Oh, you want to slide on this provision of the compact you signed with us? What is is worth to you?&quot;

The main reason el Bunko wants a &quot;voluntary&quot; compact is because he can shake down companies. If he were serious, he&#39;d back legislation in Congress. Although at the moment, with the R&#39;s in control, any piece of toilet paper they&#39;d pass would be toothless and full of holes. Maybe he realized that? Him? Not a chance.

Well it wouldn&#39;t be a Republican administration and Congress without leaving a big fat mess for the next folks to clean up.  How else can they get back to whinging about the debt in 2032 without making the next admin have to bail the economy out for the 4th time in my life.

Though I did hear one guy vibecoded his way into asking a sysadmin to restore to a week-old backup.

Claude sonnet 4.5. Shite. It can replace a below average intern.

The proposed pact, which is not final and could be subject to change, is framed as a voluntary agreement...
More sound and fury, signifying nothing.

The proposed pact, which is not final and could be subject to change, is framed as a voluntary agreement...

The summary: ...The proposed pact... is framed as a voluntary agreement between President Donald Trump and major U.S. tech companies and data center developers.

Wait, between who??? This is an agreement between the data companies and Donald Trump, personally?

Mega corps and the orange turd. Two entities known for keeping promise.

What, do we expect The Great Negotiator to work with Congress and pass actual laws?  Perish the thought that the admin would acknowledge such things and that the Republican Congress would remember Article I exists.

Not said is that to get around this the companies will have to make a healthy transaction with the Presidential Crypto Bribe System.

Hence also the saying &quot;the king is dead, long live the king&quot;. It means that the subjects of the previous king, who are no longer subjects to anyone temporarily, proclaim their agreement with

As it stands datacentre operators are pulling all stops to bypass existing regulations. What makes anyone think they will voluntarily join this agreement?

Funny story about Microsoft in Amsterdam, they are building a huge vertical datacentre. Why vertical? Turns out the regulations governing hyperscale datacentres in the Netherlands considered the power consumption *AND* foot print (law makers are stupid the world over it seems). By building a 20 story datacentre they keep their foot print on the ground below the threshold and their hyperscale datacentre suddenly didn&#39;t need to meet any regulations or approvals for a hyperscale datacentre.

We&#39;re talking about companies that are proposing putting datacentres at the bottom of the ocean, or powering them via magical fairy dust ... I mean SMRs. We&#39;re talking about companies who couldn&#39;t get a grid connection resulting in Elon Musk getting 30 small gas turbine generators used typically for temporary construction power to run his datacentre permanently, and then 2 years later tell the local government that he doesn&#39;t need to meet emissions regulations for a power plant because the gas turbines are &quot;not permanent&quot;.

No one is going to give a shit about Trump&#39;s proposal. It makes me wonder ... is this just all for show?

A newer generation of spacecraft may at last resolve these mysteries.Yes.  And when we do find the evidence of former successful space missions to our moon by multiple countries (as if being able to telescope the lunar tracks from Earth isn&#39;t evidence enough), we can finally tell the conspiracy theorists still living on a lunar Hollywood set to shut the fuck up already.

Most flatties don&#39;t dispute probes, they dispute humans went.

I keep it in my desk drawer when you&#39;re not looking.

Clearly it&#39;s the lizard people that faked the footprints.

as if being able to telescope the lunar tracks from Earth isn&#39;t evidence enoughWe can&#39;t do that. The largest telescopes on Earth have a mirror diameter of 8 m, which gives a diffraction limit of something like 50 meters per pixel.We have photos of the landing sites from lunar orbiters like LRO (50 cm/px) and Chandrayaan-2 (down to 25 cm/px).

Little-known fact: In the post-Stalin USSR, because of poor nutrition - your average Soviet adult was only about 30cm tall.

One of the best directors in the Soviet era.

Notable firsts include but are not limited to:

1) First orbiting satellite.2) First photo of far-side of the moon3) First animal in orbit (poor Laika)4) First human in orbit5) First space-walk6) First photo from surface of moon7) First probe to return data from surface of Mars (short-lived)8) First automated sample return from moon9) First photo from surface of another planet (Venus)

ah a sad result in a slav child&#39;s formulative years of delaying the transition to solid food and vodka

NASA still has lots of &quot;firsts&quot; . Unfortunately they all relate to DEI now.Until NASA&#39;s critics come anywhere remotely close to catching up to what NASA achieved in 1969, their nitpicking is not very compelling to me.

We need 3 ark space-ships. One for the MAGAs, one for the wokes,  and the rest of us will be along shortly.

IMHO, the greatest Soviet achievement in space was the Venera program, which managed to gather and transmit data from the harshest rocky environment in the Solar System by a large margin.Venera 9 - Took the first photo on the surface of a planet other than earth, in 1975. It survived on the surface for 53 minutes. Amazing.

First animals back alive from orbit.First woman in space.First space station, and in fact all the early space stations.Many firsts for long duration missions in space.

Their moon rocket design has proven to be the right track in the long term, having multiple small engines similar to Starship. They just didn&#39;t have the funding or the political will to make it work.

Then we all know exactly what it looked like!

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign seemed to hit a horrifying crescendo in the last month, with chaos in the streets of Minneapolis stretching the city’s populace to a near-breaking point. Unfortunately, the situation is about to get worse. On Friday, two far-right judges greenlit the Trump administration’s radical reinterpretation of federal law that would sweep millions more immigrants into mandatory detention, potentially expanding the mass deportation machinery in new and horrifying ways. Their 2–1 decision for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would transform the entire United States into a permanent border zone where unauthorized immigrants can be jailed indefinitely without bond, even years after they arrived. It supercharges the administration’s push to build an archipelago of mass detention centers larger than any existing jail or prison in the country. These mega-warehouses—which are not designed for human habitation—will hold up to 10,000 immigrants each, with little oversight and little recourse for detainees whose rights are violated. Even as public outrage over Trump’s mass deportation campaign intensifies, the legal and physical infrastructure of the plan are rapidly falling into place.

The 5th Circuit’s Friday decision gives new legal muscle to the Stephen Miller–orchestrated mass deportation campaign by endorsing the administration’s audacious rereading of a 1996 immigration law governing the detention of unauthorized migrants. For nearly 30 years, both the executive branch and the federal judiciary have understood this statute to draw a sharp line between migrants “seeking admission” at the border and those already in the country. The former are subject to mandatory detention without bond (with a few narrow exceptions). The latter, by contrast, can seek release on bond. If that request is denied, they can demand a bond hearing before an immigration judge. Most of the roughly 11 million immigrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. today fall into this second, bond-eligible group.

In July, the Trump administration collapsed the long-standing distinction between new arrivals and everyone else. It announced that it had “revisited” its view of the law and concluded that unauthorized immigrants already present in the United States are subject to mandatory detention, just like migrants encountered at the border. To reach that result, the government asserted that anyone who was never legally admitted to the country must, by definition, be “seeking admission” today. Under its theory, an immigrant who has lived here for decades is subject to the same harsh rules as someone who tried to cross the border yesterday. This shift empowered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain exponentially more immigrants without bond, prompting a flood of habeas petitions from those detainees challenging their confinement. Indeed, according to ProPublica, noncitizens have filed more of these petitions in the last 13 months than in the last three administrations combined.

Although the Trump-stacked Board of Immigration Appeals swiftly adopted the administration’s distortion of the statute, federal judges have overwhelmingly rejected it and freed detainees in habeas proceedings. As Kyle Cheney reported in Politico, at least 360 judges have spurned the government’s reasoning in more than 3,000 cases. They’ve done so in increasingly alarmed terms. Last week, Judge Thomas E. Johnston, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote: “It is appalling that the government insists that this Court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” deriding the administration’s theory as “dystopian absurdity.”

The problem, as these judges have explained, is that an unauthorized immigrant who’s already present in the country is not “seeking admission” at all; they are seeking to remain here. Yet ICE is detaining them under a statute reserved for new arrivals. By doing so, the agency is flagrantly breaking the law. So judges keep ordering ICE to release detainees—orders the agency has repeatedly flouted, prompting scathing judicial rebukes around the country.

On Friday, however, the administration finally caught a break at the 5th Circuit, the nation’s most reactionary appeals court. Justice Department officials maneuvered to ensure that the court would take up the question as quickly as possible, evidently hoping to notch a win. Two far-right judges, Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, were happy to oblige: They embraced the administration’s reinterpretation on an expedited schedule, over a furious dissent by Judge Dana Douglas, who warned: “The border is now everywhere.” With this decision in hand, ICE can enforce the mandatory detention policy in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the three states covered by the circuit. (The agency had been funneling migrants from other jurisdictions into these states already, perhaps in anticipation of such a ruling.)

Jones and Duncan’s rush to bless this mandatory detention policy smooths the path for another component of Trump’s mass deportation push: The use of mega-warehouses to detain up to 10,000 noncitizens each and supplement the much smaller facilities that currently house detainees. ICE has been buying up these warehouses over the last few months—reportedly above market value to speed up the transactions—and converting them into makeshift detention camps. More than a quarter of the proposed sites fall within the 5th Circuit. As the American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick has pointed out, these detention facilities will house far more people than any jail or prison in the U.S. today.

Reichlin-Melnick told me on Tuesday that the mandatory detention policy now supported by the 5th Circuit is “a key part of the plan to fill these warehouses.” To achieve “the broader project of mass deportation,” Reichlin-Melnick said, “you need both the legal authority and physical space.” The government’s draconian rereading of immigration law “provides the legal authority. Warehouses provide the physical spaces.”

The overarching goal is to condemn as many noncitizens as possible to these sites, then hold them there without bond until they are so desperate and miserable that they agree to be deported. ICE already subjects its detainees to horrific, degrading, and inhumane conditions while blocking attempts at meaningful oversight. The situation may grow even more dire once the agency begins locking hundreds of thousands of noncitizens—many of whom may have lived here for years with pending legal claims to resolve their status—in industrial buildings that were never designed to hold human beings. Those subject to abuse at the hands of ICE officers will have no real mechanism for redress.

Even before the mandatory detention policy, noncitizens faced an uphill battle when seeking bond before an immigration judge. Trump purged many of these judges (who lack tenure) for alleged leniency, replacing them with ideologically aligned substitutes. But release on bond was still a real possibility for those who could show that they did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Now the government has shut off that safety valve, and—at least in the 5th Circuit—the machinery of detention can run at full speed. A series of Supreme Court decisions have closed off the possibility of a nationwide injunction or class action that could put a stop to this regime all at once. Immigrants’ only hope is that SCOTUS will swiftly and definitively shoot down the government’s contortion of the statute.

There is some reason for optimism that it will. Just eight years ago, the conservative justices appeared to foreclose the conflation of new arrivals and longer-term residents, acknowledging that the latter group is eligible for bond. But this Supreme Court has repeatedly twisted the law for Trump, particularly in his quest to immiserate noncitizens, and there’s no guarantee it will resist this act of legal vandalism. The administration is proceeding as if it already has the justices in its pocket. Unless and until they intervene, each new warehouse moves the country one step closer to the president’s vision of an American gulag.

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just months after Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad, researchers have found the feature can be abused to achieve remote code execution (RCE).

Tracked as CVE-2026-20841 (8.8), the vulnerability was addressed in the Windows maker&#39;s most recent Patch Tuesday fixes.

The flaw misses out on the top severity scores as it requires a little social engineering in order to get it working, but from there it&#39;s plain sailing for an attacker.

When we say &quot;social engineering,&quot; it&#39;s not the super sophisticated stuff like the dark art practised by Scattered Spider. It&#39;s more just tricking people into opening untrusted links.

There are ample email security protections available to organizations, yet phishing remains the most effective initial access vector for cybercriminals, and with Notepad installed as standard on most Windows PCs, it means CVE-2026-20841 could affect quite a few machines.

Attacker needs only to get an unwitting user to open a Markdown file in Notepad and click a malicious link embedded inside.

According to Microsoft&#39;s explanation, a hacker can exploit the vulnerability to launch &quot;unverified protocols&quot; that load and execute files with the user&#39;s permissions.

The Windows giant also confirmedthere are no known cases of the flaw being exploited in the wild.

Microsoft began rolling out Markdown functionality in Notepad in May 2025 as part of a WordPad-ish update before going GA.

The move was divisive: while some welcomed the new feature, many thought Notepad should have been left alone.

Critics argued that making Notepad more like WordPad, which Microsoft killed in 2024, betrayed the app&#39;s core ethos as a lightweight, fast, no-frills program.

Then came the AI. In September, Windows Insiders were treated to AI-assisted writing, rewriting, and summarization features — provided they were running a Copilot+ PC.

All of this, including Markdown support, can be toggled off in Notepad&#39;s settings, but ships as default.

While not affiliated with Microsoft, the disclosure of CVE-2026-20841 comes just days after the Notepad++ team confirmed major security issues.

Earlier this month, it announced fixes and version upgrades after state-sponsored cybercrims compromised its update service as early as June, leading to targeted attacks on organizations with interests in East Asia. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/ai_datacenters_bcs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Only 20 percent of datacenters are considered AI-ready across Europe and the Middle East, despite the growing demand for infrastructure to accelerate AI processing.

A report published by datacenter consultancy BCS says that AI-ready capacity in the region is limited, and there are a number of challenges facing the commercial property developers that want to build more, the biggest of which is a shortage of the right skills.

While the report expects AI-ready facilities to rise to around 70 percent by 2030, demand may still outpace available infrastructure.

These figures are drawn from more than 3,000 industry respondents across 41 countries, BCS says, in a bid to capture the constraints that are currently facing the delivery of new-build facilities across Europe.

The core issue? Most operational sites were designed for traditional enterprise or cloud workloads. Racks of power-hungry GPU servers demand far higher power densities, more robust cooling solutions, and greater operational resilience than these facilities were built to provide, BCS says.

This means that while many sites may have sufficient overall capacity on paper, they lack the ability to deliver power at rack level or manage the sustained heat loads AI infrastructure generates.

The 20 percent figure doesn&#39;t signal industry failure, BCS says, but reflects how high the bar for AI-ready infrastructure has become, and how much of the existing estate was built for an earlier generation of demand..

The major headache for bit barn developers is the confluence of a number of well-known datacenter construction issues that increasingly occur simultaneously on the same projects.

Across much of Europe, there&#39;s a shortage of available land to locate facilities, a dearth of materials and heavy equipment, difficulties getting connected to the energy grid, and a lack of skilled staff.

These are no longer isolated issues, but are increasingly felt together, BCS chief James Hart writes in the intro to the report. As a result, the industry is entering a new phase, where growth in the market is still expected, but the ability to deliver on that ambition is ever more constrained.

According to BCS figures, the vast majority of industry professionals polled (93 percent) expect to see rising demand for datacenter capacity over the next twelve months, yet available supply is forecast to shrink.

This ought to be a good position, but 95 percent of respondents expect the shortage of skilled professionals to worsen over the same period, and 86 percent report that supply chain volatility has become a structural feature of the industry rather than a temporary hitch.

BCS says half of developers have missed deadlines or client objectives due to skills shortages, and 53 percent indicate that supply chain issues will directly influence future site selection.

Firms that emerge strongest will be better organized, BCS believes those able to manage collaboration across teams, disciplines, and partners that don&#39;t traditionally work closely together, and to navigate trade-offs under pressure.

However, despite the warnings, BCS says the UK market still has a potential pipeline for more than 10 GW of new capacity over the next ten years, while Germany, Austria, and Switzerland are tipped for more dramatic expansion this year.

London may even lose its place as the top European datacenter hub to Frankfurt by 2031, according to a separate report. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FOSDEM 2026 Isaac Freund&#39;s River compositor brings a little old-fashioned modularity and customizability to the brave new Wayland world.

One of the great joys of the FOSDEM conference is catching program items that introduce radical ideas you&#39;d never considered might be possible. Almost by accident, The Reg FOSS desk found itself in one of these – a talk titled &quot;Separating the Wayland Compositor and Window Manager.&quot;

In it, Freund introduced his River project, which he describes as &quot;a non-monolithic Wayland compositor.&quot; River brings to Wayland the idea of a window manager as a separate program, and it already supports a list of ten different WMs that can work with it.

Freund is a member of the core team of the Zig programming language, also the basis of the Phoenix X11 server we mentioned last month, and he also works on wlroots, a set of modules for building Wayland compositors. He explained that with River, he &quot;plans to change the Wayland architecture to make it more easy to experiment.&quot;

Currently, a Wayland compositor combines three primary functions into one. It must act as a display server, it must manage windows, and it must composite those windows together to be displayed on screen. The River project, which is about three years old now, splits this up. It&#39;s a display server and it&#39;s a compositor, but it doesn&#39;t do window management. Instead, it offers a documented window management protocol so that another, separate program can do the window management.

He says that in the month and a half after he published the protocol, &quot;at least nine independent WMs were written.&quot;

As the accompanying slides [PDF] explain, the core of the program is a fairly simple state machine, and the window manager&#39;s job is letting you arrange them and decorate them as you wish. It&#39;s not involved in displaying them, so it&#39;s very fast. As he noted with a grin, this offers you the freedom of choice in X11-style &quot;decorations&quot; (title bars, buttons, and so on), compared to GNOME and its &quot;client side decorations.&quot;

It&#39;s important to note that River needs its own window managers. It won&#39;t let old X11 window managers run on Wayland – that&#39;s not what it&#39;s aimed at. For that, take a look at the Wayback project we covered last year – it&#39;s moved to hosting on GitLab and is up to version 0.3 by now.

Forestalling some obvious questions, he included a section headed simply &quot;Why?&quot; The points he called out were that writing window managers is much easier than before. They can be developed in high-level languages with no increase in latency, and the user can restart or even switch to a different window manager without losing their session. He expressed the hope that this will help to promote diversity in the Wayland ecosystem, noting that even today there are still lots more X11 window managers than there are Wayland compositors.

There was also a &quot;Why not?&quot; section, which noted that this was not for non-traditional environments like virtual-reality headsets and so on. River doesn&#39;t change how the contents of windows are displayed, so it can&#39;t offer things like wobbly windows and other special effects. The protocol, he said, is stable: &quot;We do not break window managers,&quot; an intentional nod to one of the rules set by kernel supremo Linus Torvalds concerning Linux&#39;s kernel/userland split.

In the Q&A section at the end, he called out one advantage of his approach. One of the River window managers is his own, and he says that it&#39;s written in a &quot;very high-level language&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s slow and totally unoptimized – but it&#39;s fast and stable.&quot; This is because there are no round trips between the window manager and the River server-cum-compositor. Indeed, there are &quot;no calls at all, unless windows are moved or something. Otherwise, it stays out of the way.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FOSDEM 2026 Michal Pleban knows his old kit inside out, and his talk on the CIDCO MailStation was one of the most interesting of FOSDEM for us – as well as the funniest.

Pleban&#39;s talk, &quot;Hacking the last Z80 computer ever made,&quot; was more than just a dive into retro computing. It also explored some of the many strange decisions involved in launching a new range of hardware based on the eight-bit Zilog Z80 chip in 1999 – when the 16-bit computer era was largely over, and just a couple of years before 32-bit x86 chips would be replaced by x86-64.

A couple of years ago, Zilog discontinued the standalone Z80 processor, bringing a nostalgic tear to the eyes of many a senior geek, including The Register&#39;s Rupert Goodwins. If there were pub quizzes aimed specifically at graying techies, a good question might be &quot;what was the last ever Z80 computer?&quot;

The CIDCO MailStation, also sold in the US as Earthlink&#39;s Mivo 100, is a strong contender. Launched in 1999, Time Magazine reported on the final model, the cordless Mivo 350 – which is still listed on Amazon. While writing this, we found units for sale on eBay US for under $26 – or less than $12 if you don&#39;t mind an untested one.

As Pleban put it, it&#39;s a late-1990s &quot;internet appliance,&quot; sold under the tagline of &quot;Email made easy.&quot; That slogan might have proved a tad ambitious as the slogan was replaced on later models&#39; packaging by &quot;Email without the PC.&quot;

Its specifications are good for an eight-bit machine. It&#39;s a self-contained unit, with a 320 x 128 mono LCD, a 12 MHz Z80 with 128 KB of RAM, and a bit over a megabyte of flash. Aside from its dial-up modem, the only way to get anything in or out of it was over a Laplink cable attached to its bidirectional parallel printer port.

But it is an internet appliance, only really intended for sending and receiving email. So the $64 question (we really wouldn&#39;t pay more) is: is it a computer? It has a keyboard, a screen, some storage, some communications, and it can run apps (if you allow a generous definition). Pleban&#39;s most telling point, though, is that you can hack it.

He proceeded to detail how. The first method he explored was via the Yahoo! icon on the home screen. This shows, or rather showed, headline news stories. What&#39;s remarkable is how it shows the formatted news stories. There&#39;s no markup format to handle bold, italics, fonts, and so on. The machine arguably doesn&#39;t have the resources.

No, each page of news is a bitmap rendered by a tiny program. Every day, the service emailed you a new app. This is a daily email with an executable attachment and it&#39;s opened for you directly; it never hits your inbox. This innovative way of updating a remote device is even patented. The email attachment is encrypted with the SDES algorithm. Originally intended as a teaching tool rather than for real-world security, this uses a ten-bit key – so to decrypt something, just generate all 1,024 possible keys and try them. Yours will be in there.

This would be ridiculously easy to exploit, but there&#39;s a snag. You need to activate an account via a telephone call to the United State to a service that was shut down in 2011.

So Pleban moved on to the second method. It&#39;s possible to dump the device&#39;s firmware, which reveals text strings relating to software updates. That means that it can be updated. It&#39;s even documented, and the documentation only runs to about ten pages. It uses a Centronics Laplink cable – not the modern Laplink cables, which are much faster. The slight snag here is that very few computers have Centronics ports any more. (Before you ask, no, a USB adapter won&#39;t work.)

Then he moved on to the third method. The device has a diagnostics menu, accessed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+T while turning it on. Press Shift+5 and you get a hexadecimal viewer of the ROM code. Another keystroke makes it into a hex editor, so you could manually rewrite firmware. If you have a very steady hand anyway.

Inspection of the ROM reveals that there&#39;s a 64-byte loader that accepts new ROM code over the parallel port. With that, it&#39;s time to do one&#39;s best Matthew Broderick impersonation and say &quot;we&#39;re in!&quot;.

One of the chief snags with this approach is that there are no checks or validation steps when uploading a new ROM. One error and the machine is bricked. There is no recovery procedure to get back from bad firmware. During the Q&A session, an audience member asked Pleban how many MailStations he had killed in the process of researching the talk. He reluctantly admitted that he now had three dead ones but that was OK – he had another eight spares. He also brought two boxed units to the talk, and gave one of them away at the end.

This is an interesting little machine for those who enjoy low-level hacking, and he estimates the companies sold hundreds of thousands of them. Pleban himself offers various resources for aspiring MailStation hackers: an emulator for testing your code, a host application to transfer software to the MailStation, and hardware documentation.

The Reg FOSS desk is quite interested in this sort of thing, and we hadn&#39;t heard of this device before. However, other people have been hacking on them for some years now and we found quite a bit of resources and information, from the Fybertech page about it to Josh Stein&#39;s page about using it as a Z80 development platform. He&#39;s even built a Wi-Fi interface for the thing. &quot;Dr Francintosh&quot; is working on giving it a Raspberry Pi brain transplant. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legacy IT issues are hampering key technical measures designed to prevent highly sensitive data leaks, UK government officials say.

On Tuesday, Parliament&#39;s Science, Innovation and Technology Committee grilled senior ministers on the progress made to prevent a repeat of the incident involving the Ministry of Defence (MoD) accidentally exposing data that put Afghan informants&#39; lives at risk.

The hearing was scheduled to discuss the government&#39;s response following its Information Security Review, which, among other things, recommended that it implement the technical means to share information directly from the source, and not via email.

Considered one of the most sensitive leaks of data in recent British history, the MoD twice exposed the details of Afghans who assisted British forces during the Taliban conflict. Around 19,000 applicants for the UK&#39;s resettlement scheme had their details compromised via the classic CC-not-BCC email blunder.

Among the 14 data security recommendations in the review - compiled in 2023 but not published until August 2025 - was developing methods for cross-government information sharing that don&#39;t rely on email.

The aim was to eliminate human error causing accidental data leaks, a pain point the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office previously highlighted and was trying to fix through cultural change.

Ian Murray, minister for digital government and data, said &quot;cultural change happens through practice,&quot; and the idea of technical solutions blocking civil servants from attaching documents to emails is one of the ways to enact this.

Asked whether it is being rolled out across government, Murray confirmed it would be &quot;where appropriate,&quot; but Aimee Smith, the government&#39;s chief data officer, warned of the challenges.

&quot;Where you have departments operating on various different legacy systems, emailing an attachment internally may actually be the only way that you can take information from one system to another,&quot; she said.

&quot;That&#39;s the complicated nature of what we&#39;re looking at across all of the departments and the arm&#39;s-length bodies. So, in principle, we would be setting out how we want people to operate, but there&#39;s going to need to be some considered support and focus and investment for departments to get there.&quot;

Smith also said &quot;there is more than enough capability&quot; across government departments, regardless of whether they run Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, to share documents without releasing them.

It is easier for government departments to share documents in this way internally than it is to give them to external recipients, such as arm&#39;s-length bodies, which may run different legacy kit.

&quot;We have got standards about the kind of email - what you can and can&#39;t email - that are put out to departments, and how they should be configuring their system,&quot; Smith said.

Cross-departmental sharing with external recipients poses greater difficulties due to differing legacy IT systems, she said. However, the necessary tools exist, and recent year-end guidance has been issued asking departments to comply.

The meeting did not start well for the ministers in attendance. Committee member Kit Malthouse admonished an apologetic Dan Jarvis, the UK&#39;s security minister, for not arriving prepared to discuss an earlier topic of rising phone thefts in London, despite the committee&#39;s requests.

Soon after, Murray was questioned about his previous comments relating to government data security, in his words, being &quot;pretty good.&quot; The committee was not happy with the wording and sought assurances about what this meant.

Murray said he reserved stronger wording &quot;because you could never say with great certainty that you could secure every bit of data,&quot; since human error invariably is a factor that can&#39;t always be accounted for.

He said, given the volume of data involved - billions of transactions per day - the vast majority is processed securely, but acknowledged the seriousness of such cases that aren&#39;t, however rare they might be.

Committee chair Dame Chi Onwurah questioned whether the government is holding itself to a high enough standard, especially against the backdrop of an incoming digital ID program and sprawling eVisa system issues.

&quot;It&#39;s important that any data breach is a huge issue, and government has to get it right all the time, particularly if we&#39;re rolling out digital ID, which is going to be the basis of government services and delivery,&quot; she said. &quot;Government has to get it right all the time.&quot;

Jarvis jumped to the government&#39;s defense, saying: &quot;That&#39;s where we want to get, but I think the point that Minister Murray was making entirely reasonably is that there is human error, which accounts for some of these losses and incidents.

&quot;And whilst you can put in all of the processes that you like and you can have the right culture and the right leadership, there will be mistakes that will be made. What we have to do is to minimize the risk of people making those mistakes, and where mistakes have been made, we have to ensure that we&#39;ve got the right procedures to sweep up after them.

&quot;But please don&#39;t take away anything other than our absolute determination to achieve the best outcome. That&#39;s what we&#39;re all working to achieve.&quot;

The committee further probed for information about any assessments made of government systems, and asked if the relevant data could be publicized.

Among the details sought by the committee were specific Red-Amber-Green (RAG) ratings of each government system relating to data security.

Murray said he wouldn&#39;t object to sharing details about the overall percentage of legacy systems across government privately with the committee, but must confer with colleagues before committing to anything.

Vincent Devine, head of UK government security, said an &quot;assurance exercise&quot; was carried out in October 2025, which found a 90 percent compliance rate with data security standards across government departments.

There are plans to include this data in future annual reviews, but he couldn&#39;t say how much would be reported this year.

Devine noted that departments receive annual RAG ratings on various security measures, with an overall organizational rating also assigned. However, this data remains confidential to avoid providing intelligence to potential attackers.

Dame Chi emphasized the committee would welcome access to any available data, noting that such measurable metrics are essential for tracking departmental progress.

The committee chair also led calls in August, following the security review&#39;s publication, for more transparency around progress the government was making toward meeting the report&#39;s 14 recommendations.

She said at the time: &quot;The government still has questions to answer about the review. Why have only 12 of the 14 recommendations been implemented? And why has it kept the very existence of this review a secret for so long, even after the 2022 Afghan Breach became public?

&quot;I have asked Minister Pat McFadden and Information Commissioner John Edwards to appear before my committee to explain the circumstances around this review and how far its recommendations have been implemented. Proper scrutiny on this is desperately needed, and it&#39;s crucial we have a better understanding of how the government plans to stop these dangerous data breaches.&quot;

Murray said that 13.5 of the 14 recommendations have been implemented.

&quot;13.5, I would say, if not all 14 on the basis that there are still some technical meetings to take place with regard to the governance structures, but, in the sense of those recommendations, all of them have been implemented, and actually we&#39;ve gone further in some areas.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As OpenAI walks the advertising tightrope to balance revenue gains against credibility and safety, ad kingpin Google is roaring ahead to use AI to improve its advertising products.

Forrester vice president and principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told The Register &quot;the jury is out&quot; on whether consumers will bite on ads in chatbots, like the ones OpenAI introduced in its lowest ChatGPT tiers on Monday.

&quot;Answer engines have earned high trust among consumers partly because of the conversational fluidity of the experiences and partly because of their prescriptive and often authoritative personality,&quot; he said, using a neologism for AI chatbots. &quot;Throwing advertising into the mix muddies the waters and detracts from the credibility of the experience. There is likely to be a backlash in the short term, and Anthropic is already using the Super Bowl to stir those murky waters,&quot; he noted, referring to the anti-advertising ads OpenAI&#39;s main competitor aired on TV during the game on Sunday.

One thing working in advertising&#39;s favor is a jaded public that expects to have a quid pro quo relationship with technology services, whether it is Netflix, LinkedIn, or Google, Chatterjee said.

&quot;The truth is that despite protestations, consumers have progressively become comfortable with a give-and-take model, be that exchanging information for value received, or suffering advertising for pricing relief,&quot; he said. &quot;Streamers have already proven that ad-supported pricing tiers are very effective at price discriminating among consumer segments. The future of consumer-facing AI models will likely be one that is interrupted with advertising, except for those who pay to spare themselves that interruption.&quot;

Google is taking a slightly different approach. While it is not planning to integrate ads directly into Gemini results, Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler told investors during its fourth quarter earnings call last week that the company saw three areas where AI could be &quot;transformational&quot; for its ad revenue: ad quality, advertiser tools, and new AI user experiences.

And thanks to the questions users have willingly fed into Gemini, Schindler said Google has improved its output of relevant, high-quality ads, and it plans to use that knowledge across its ad offerings.

&quot;Gemini’s understanding of intent has increased our ability to deliver ads on longer, more complex searches that were previously challenging to monetize,” Schindler said. &quot;Gemini models also have a significant impact on query understanding in non-English languages, expanding opportunities for businesses to scale globally.&quot;

Google is already experimenting with ads that appear near the AI-generated answers at the top of search results when searchers are in &quot;AI Mode,&quot; Schindler said.

&quot;We have significantly increased our focus on AI Mode and are in the early stages of experimenting with AI Mode monetization, like testing ads below the AI response, with more underway,” Schindler said. “For example, we announced Direct Offers, a new Google Ads pilot, which will allow advertisers to show exclusive offers for shoppers who are ready to buy, directly in AI Mode. This new type of sponsored content uses AI to match the right offer provided by the retailer to the right user... Soon, people can use a new checkout experience to buy directly in AI Mode and Gemini from select merchants.”

A Google spokesperson reiterated that there are currently no ads in its Gemini app or in the Gemini browser experience, and told us &quot;All ads in AI Mode will be marked as &#39;sponsored content&#39;; anything that doesn&#39;t have that label is going to be organic from the model.”

&quot;Even if users are able to purchase items inside Gemini, it will currently only be possible if the items are surfaced through an organic search,” the spokesperson added.

During the quarter ended Dec. 31, Google generated $82.3 billion in ad revenue: $63.1 billion from search and other Google sites, $11.4 billion from YouTube, and $7.8 billion from third-party websites, apps, and platforms that use Google&#39;s ad services.

Meanwhile, the day after Claude dinged Altman’s company with Super Bowl spots depicting humorous scenarios of AI ads gone wrong, OpenAI revealed what those ads would look like in reality.

The House of Altman said the company is testing ads, and only to logged-in users of the free and lowest-tier Go subscription plans. Users in other tiers such as Plus, Pro, Enterprise, and Education will have ad-free experiences for now.

&quot;Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks. We’re starting with a test to learn, listen, and make sure we get the experience right,&quot; according to an OpenAI blog post.

Several safeguards are also in place, OpenAI said, including age restrictions that limit ads to accounts where the user is over 18 years of age. Ads will also not appear around the sensitive topics of health, mental wellbeing, or politics. Additionally, the ads will not influence ChatGPT’s answers and will be clearly labeled.

Chatterjee said OpenAI hopes its ads defray costs and provide the company with some economic relief, rather than becoming a significant contributor to revenue. The analyst believes that could change in the future, as Forrester data indicates a majority of consumers use AI model-driven answer engines in their discovery process, rather than relying on classic search engines alone.

“Not only is adoption growing rapidly, but those who use these tools have experiences comparable in quality to traditional searches and, in many instances, trust the outcomes of these answer engines more,” he said. “A future in which AI models are the preeminent mode of consumer discovery threatens traditional media channels.” ®

Keep your head down. Compartmentalize. Don’t make trouble.

That’s what many tech workers are taking their CEOs’ strategic silence to mean, amid an immigration crackdown across the US by the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security. Widespread violence by federal agents has sparked protests in Minneapolis and across the country. One month after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, and two weeks after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, the majority of tech CEOs have remained tight-lipped. Internally, workers from several companies describe a culture of silence and fear — and trepidation over what kind of future they’re helping to build.

The Verge spoke with tech workers at giants like Microsoft, YouTube, and Google, as well as tech companies in specific industries, like biometric verification firm CLEAR and medical device / healthcare company Abbott. Most described the same feeling of being told to stick to the corporate mission, whether outright or not, and feeling fearful for their jobs if they were to stick a toe out of line. Microsoft, Google, and Abbott did not provide a comment. CLEAR’s chief privacy officer, Lynn Haaland, told The Verge in a statement, “We do not work with ICE and never have, full stop.”

Many also described an eerie lack of acknowledgment in town hall meetings and public messaging from their companies. Internal forums and messaging platforms at the companies were also often devoid of mentions, besides a number of posts viewed by The Verge on Microsoft’s internal forum, Viva Engage. Some of the posts in a political discussion channel mentioned the intensifying protests in Minneapolis, ICE’s actions and victims, and Donald Trump’s administration. Posts in a different channel asked for actionable guidance on what to do in case of ICE detention and which documents the company recommends people perpetually carry on their person.

“The dissent I’ve seen is like a whisper,” said one employee who works on Azure at Microsoft, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, adding that people are afraid to speak out publicly and not sure who to trust internally. “It’s a fear-based culture right now.”

Although federal agents have killed at least eight people so far in 2026 and public protests are intensifying, chief executives at companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, AWS, and OpenAI have stayed radio silent in terms of public statements. Privately, Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly sent internal memos to staff about the situation, both calling for deescalation and expressing their beliefs that President Trump would rise to the occasion. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei briefly spoke publicly, mentioning in a NBC interview that the company does not have contracts with ICE, and he posted on X about “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota” and “the importance of preserving democratic values and rights at home.”

It’s a far cry from resistance efforts in Big Tech years back. In 2018, Microsoft workers presented leadership with a petition protesting the company’s ICE contracts, signed by about 500 Microsoft employees. That same year, thousands of Google workers successfully protested the company’s “Project Maven” partnership with the Pentagon, including about 4,000 Googler signatures on a petition. Tech companies’ responses (or lack thereof) to ICE’s recent actions are also a significant departure from their statements in 2018, and from their statements and financial commitments to the Black Lives Matter movement after George Floyd’s murder in 2020.

Meanwhile, most tech leaders have attempted to ingratiate themselves with Trump since he resumed office, donating to his inauguration fund or the main pro-Trump super PAC, dining with him at the White House, and putting out public statements praising the administration’s views on tech and AI. Many of them have also significantly increased their collaborations with the government, either putting out products specifically designed for use by military, defense, and intelligence agencies — like Anthropic’s Claude Gov or OpenAI’s ChatGPT Gov — or continuing or expanding their contracts with DHS, ICE, and other agencies focused on the immigration crackdown, such as Palantir. A grassroots movement aiming to send a signal to the Trump administration over anti-immigrant actions calls for consumers to boycott Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and more.

An employee at YouTube, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said, “I am personally frustrated that companies have cozied up to Trump, told their workers to just kind of shut up and focus on the mission, and not make any distinctions about what the company actually stands for at this moment in time. Are you on the side of democracy? Are you on the side of terrorizing our populace? Are you on the side of ripping people from their families, arbitrary deportations, arbitrary detentions, multiple deaths at the hands of ICE now? Are you in favor of that? Where do you stand?”

A recent petition signed by more than 1,000 Google employees dictates demands for leadership to acknowledge and “publicly call for urgent government responses to this crisis,” for the company to host an “emergency Q&A session for workers” regarding Google’s DHS, CBP, and military contracts, and to take steps to protect workers, whether they be cafeteria workers or data center employees.

Another petition that began circulating after Good’s death — created by the organization ICEout.tech and titled “Tech demands ICE out of our cities” — highlights the fact that when Trump wanted to send the national guard to San Francisco in October, tech industry leaders reportedly pressured him into backing off. Petition signatories are calling for tech CEOs to do the same thing now. The three demands: “Call the White House and demand that ICE leave our cities,” “cancel all company contracts with ICE,” and “speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.” The petition has garnered more than 2,000 public signatures to date, listing employees at Palantir, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, AWS, Apple, Anthropic, OpenAI, Salesforce, LinkedIn, TikTok, Spotify, Figma, Adobe, Mozilla, Stripe, Block, and more.

“There has been a very perceptible shift in how people are talking about what’s happening,” Lisa Conn, one of the organizers of the ICEout.tech petition, said in an interview with The Verge, detailing tech workers’ concerns about ICE tactics and discrepancies. She said the petition started being shared in Signal groups and WhatsApp chats and has spread quickly in recent weeks, with even business leaders expressing their concerns about a potential economic crisis stemming from ICE’s actions. “When the government starts killing people on the streets, it’s really bad for business,” she said, adding, “This is not hypothetical. This is how economies hollow out.”

The overall lack of tech CEO statements and public action didn’t stop some non-C-suite leaders and staffers from speaking out: Google’s chief scientist and Gemini lead Jeff Dean posted on X that Pretti’s killing was “absolutely shameful” and that “every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.” OpenAI’s head of global business, James Dyett, posted on X, “There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets. Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”

“Internally, people are really hush-hush,” the YouTube employee said. “They’ve gotten the point that leaders don’t want them to be bringing in the outside world. They want [them] to focus on their narrow definition of the job.” He added, “Is it still okay to be an employee in technology right now? Is the future we’re building towards bright, or is it dystopian?” He also said that the message he’d heard “loud and clear” from YouTube leadership was that staffers should remain focused on the company mission.

Another Google employee said that she feels that the state of the world has been acknowledged in some of the meetings she’s attended and that she was heartened to see Dean’s public statement. “We’re also a company that’s made up of a lot of immigrants with various statuses,” she said. “I can imagine being somebody that is here on one of those H-1B visas feeling very vulnerable about talking too much because it’s like we’ve got secret police, it feels like, out in the world.”

The Microsoft Azure employee said she and many colleagues had openly discussed their anti-ICE stance in person and that Microsoft’s stated mission — “to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more” — was completely at odds with the company’s actions. It was also at odds, she said, with why she and her colleagues had joined Microsoft in the first place.

“I’ve hit my limit of what I’m willing to tolerate,” the Microsoft Azure employee said. “I already knew that I was uncomfortable with what was happening — I know Microsoft works with ICE, I know GitHub has contracts with ICE and they’ve had those for a long time, and I’ve never been okay with that — but I still try to believe that the good that I’m doing is greater than the horrors that are a part of this. But there’s a limit to what we can put up with. And I’ve hit my limit.”

A second Microsoft employee told The Verge that internal portals she had combed through had zero acknowledgment of the situation, and that all updates seem to be focused on the company’s AI priorities for the year or new chips. She said within her team and her branch of the organization, there’s been no mention of what’s going on, even in town halls, and that “it feels like there’s no space to talk about it.”

“I’m not surprised, I’m just wildly disappointed,” the Microsoft employee said. “I haven’t been able to think about work very well.” She brought up the fact that some employees must be located in, or have ties to, Minneapolis. “To not hear anything about how we’re supporting those people, even just a nod to it like, ‘Hey, we have … resources you can reach out to in case of mental health’ … It really has been nothing.”

An employee at medtech giant Abbott who works out of one of the company’s offices near Minneapolis said she’s felt supported by her direct manager, but higher up the chain, there’s been no acknowledgement of what’s going on, including by CEO Robert B. Ford. She said staff received a generic HR email about mental health resources with no acknowledgment of the situation, and that there’s been no stated protocol for how to proceed if ICE shows up at the office or at their home. Like other tech workers, she described in-person office conversations with coworkers she trusts as the main form of resistance at the moment. She described a constant state of hypervigilance and “keeping your head on a swivel,” since ICE vehicles are “everywhere” within the community.

“Based on my experiences here in Minneapolis, I think basically every building, no matter what kind of building you are … should have a plan in place for if ICE is spotted on your property,” the Abbott employee said. “I’ve been pretty shocked that there’s not been any communications about, ‘This is our plan on what to do.’ And we have plenty of workers in the building that are people of color, and the experience we know here is they’ll grab US citizens too, so it doesn’t really matter what your citizen status is.”

An employee at CLEAR, which works closely in tandem with the Transportation Security Administration at airports, described the company as being “very fear-based” with “a lot of intimidation” and calls to “fall in line and accept and say yes to everything and not really question too much.”

“I don’t necessarily trust that the technology that we have, that the resources we have, will be used for something good,” the employee said. “I just don’t really believe that having people’s biometrics and access to personal information based off of the way their body moves — I don’t trust that that wouldn’t be used for immigration verification.”

Like the other workers The Verge spoke with, the CLEAR employee was fearful of ruffling feathers — but felt leadership’s affinity for the Trump administration and lack of response was not just tone-deaf, but also potentially dangerous.

CLEAR’s Haaland said in her statement that the company “has one mission: to deliver secure, seamless experiences for our members in airports and beyond. We do that by making data security the highest priority and ensuring our members always maintain complete control of their information.”

“I work at Google; it’s the forefront of AI,” the YouTube employee said. “I grew up with the internet being this information superhighway, this tool of empowerment, and this amazing equalizer. Things have been nuanced and not exactly all a utopia, but I continue to believe that technology is empowering. But I see what’s happening with the administration, and all the coziness between tech companies and the administration, and I wonder, ‘What future are we building towards now?’ People are scared about what AI is going to become. The association with Trump — does that mean AI is going to become a tool of state repression? What are we really working on? What is the future that tech is shaping right now?”

The Microsoft Azure employee said she feels like a lot of tech workers are wearing a mask, smiling and going along with the protocol, but that in person, they can be more honest with those that they trust in the office. She said she found a Post-it note — which was viewed by The Verge — hidden in a meeting room that read, “I feel completely useless here, how ’bout you?”

“I think that speaks to the culture of at least Microsoft, but I think it’s happening at all of the tech companies right now,” she said.</div>

            <div id="article-text">A familiar nameplate with a new powertrain aimed directly at one of the most lucrative vehicle segments? Let’s go.

A familiar nameplate with a new powertrain aimed directly at one of the most lucrative vehicle segments? Let’s go.

Toyota unveiled the new 2027 Highlander, a fully redesigned midsize SUV that marks the brand’s first three-row electric vehicle for the US market and the first Toyota EV assembled in America. It’s a familiar name — Toyota has been selling gas Highlanders for over 20 years — with an all-new powertrain aimed directly at one of the most popular vehicle segments in the market today. To say this is Toyota’s best chance to best its EV rivals would be an understatement.

The announcement comes at a tumultuous time for the world’s best-selling automaker. Toyota’s strategy of emphasizing hybrid vehicles over pure battery-electric ones seems to have been vindicated, as global EV sales slow down and the company’s rivals report huge losses related to their EV investments. But Toyota also has a new CEO, finance chief Kenta Kon, a close ally and former secretary of current chairman Akio Toyoda. Kon’s ascension is seen as an acknowledgement that Toyota, under his financial stewardship, has successfully weathered the chaos around Chinese EVs, global tariffs, and the expensive and extended shift to EVs.

The Toyota Highlander is an acknowledgement of some of those challenges. It’s going to be built at Toyota’s factory in Kentucky, at a time when domestic manufacturing is the best way to avoid Donald Trump’s tariffs. It’s a three-row, midsize SUV, which is the most popular vehicle segment in America right now. And it’s using a familiar name plate, acknowledging that most customers didn’t know what “bZ” stood for (it’s “beyond zero”) and weren’t exactly interested in learning.

The Toyota Highlander is an acknowledgement of some of those challenges.

The new Highlander will only come with two trims: XLE and Limited. The XLE is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, while the Limited comes standard with AWD. Battery options include a 77kWh pack and a larger 95.8kWh pack, depending on the configuration. And the AWD models with the larger battery will get up to 320 miles of estimated range, as well as 338 horsepower and 323lb-ft of torque. (FWD trims will offer 221hp and 198lb-ft of torque).

It will come with an updated infotainment setup, much like the one found in the new C-HR and bZ Woodland electric SUVs. That includes a 14-inch central touchscreen, a 12.3-inch gauge cluster, customizable ambient lighting, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and extensive charging options for devices in all three rows. And when you look up, you’ll see a fixed panoramic glass roof — the largest ever offered by Toyota.

The Highlander’s new infotainment system, powered by AT&T 5G connectivity, offers a customizable homescreen, enhanced voice recognition with “Hey Toyota” commands, dual Bluetooth phone connectivity, and integrated streaming services such as Spotify and SiriusXM.

The new Highlander seats seven, with a third row able to accommodate two passengers. When additional cargo space is needed, that third row folds flat to create more than 45 cubic feet of rear storage. And there’s a raft of additional features, like wireless charging trays, multiple USB-C ports across all three rows, rear HVAC controls, optional rear window shades, and a hands-free power liftgate.

The Highlander EV will come equipped with a NACS port for Tesla Supercharger access. Under the right conditions, the battery can charge from 10-80 percent in approximately 30 minutes using DC fast charging. Battery preconditioning, in which the battery is prepared for optimal charging, comes standard, and can be activated manually or automatically through a Drive Connect subscription (which is about $15 per month). The Highlander can also slow charge with Level 1 or 2 chargers, and will come with a dual-voltage 120V/240V charging cable.

It will also be Toyota’s first EV with vehicle-to-load capabilities, allowing it to function as a mobile power bank. Toyota says the Highlander can even serve as a backup power source during a blackout when equipped with optional bidirectional accessories. Toyota says it will have more announcements about this new feature in the future.

Size-wise, the new Highlander will go toe-to-toe with other three-row electric SUVs on the road. It will be 198.8 inches long, 78.3 inches wide, and 67.3 inches tall, with a wheelbase of 120.1 inches. That’s similar to Toyota’s current gas-powered Grand Highlander and comparable to other EVs, like the Rivian R1S, Kia EV9, and Hyundai Ioniq 9, among others.

Toyota says it will release the price of the new Highlander later this year, when it goes into production. But the automaker is certainly having a bit of a moment in the EV world. The recently revamped bZ (formerly bZ4x) has been a surprise hit for Toyota, coming in fourth in overall EV sales in the US in January, ahead of Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E. And there’s more to come, with both the C-HR hatchback and bZ Woodland expected to go on sale in the US later this year.

Toyota has a chance to make up for its lackluster effort in EV production with all these new vehicles. We’ll see if it seizes the moment.

A new AI-powered Search Party feature can scan footage from neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs. Critics worry it could be used to search for people.

Ring’s new Search Party feature has once again drawn backlash for the company. A 30-second ad that aired during Sunday’s Super Bowl showed Ring cameras “surveilling” neighborhoods to locate a lost dog. In the current political climate, a prime-time ad celebrating neighborhood surveillance struck a nerve.

People voiced concerns across social media that the AI-powered technology Ring uses to identify dogs could soon be used to search for humans. Combined with Ring’s recent rollout of its new facial recognition capability, it feels like a short leap for a pet-finding feature to be turned into a tool for state surveillance.

Privacy expert Chris Gilliard told 404 Media that the ad was “a clumsy attempt by Ring to put a cuddly face on a rather dystopian reality: widespread networked surveillance by a company that has cozy relationships with law enforcement and other equally invasive surveillance companies.”

“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance”

The fears center on the Amazon-owned Ring’s partnership with Flock Safety, a surveillance technology company that has contracts with law enforcement to use its automated license plate readers, video surveillance systems, and other technologies.

The partnership connects Ring’s massive residential camera network with an organization that has reportedly allowed ICE to access data from its own nationwide camera network.

“This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) posted on X. A vocal critic of Ring’s ties to law enforcement, Markey has pressed for greater transparency into Ring’s connections with law enforcement, along with stronger privacy protections for consumers.

Comments on the YouTube video of the ad ranged from “This is a huge problem disguised as a solution,” to “Smart way to gaslight people in mass surveillance.” Video: Ring

Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels told The Verge that Search Party is designed to match images of dogs and is “not capable of processing human biometrics.” Additionally, she maintains that the Familiar Faces facial recognition feature is separate from Search Party. It operates on the individual account level, she said, and there’s no communal sharing as there is with Search Party.

While Familiar Faces is opt-in for each user, Search Party is enabled by default on any outdoor camera enrolled in Ring’s subscription plan. It works by using AI to scan footage in the cloud for the missing dog once the owner uploads a picture to Ring’s Neighbors app. If a match is found, Ring alerts the camera’s owner, who can then choose to share the video or notify the owner through the app.

“These are not tools for mass surveillance.”

“These are not tools for mass surveillance,” Daniels said. “We build the right guardrails, and we’re super transparent about them.”

While that may be the case today, I asked whether Ring cameras could one day be used to specifically search for people. “The way these features are built, they are not capable of that today,” she said. “We don’t comment on feature road maps, but I have no knowledge or indication that we’re building features like that at this point.”

Ring users can currently share footage from their cameras with local law enforcement during an active investigation through a feature called Community Requests. Unlike previous Ring police partnerships, Community Request goes through third-party companies — the Taser company Axon and, soon, Flock. “The reason we did that is these third-party evidence management systems offer a much more secure chain of custody,” says Daniels. If a user declines a request, no one will be notified.

The company maintains that neither the government nor law enforcement can access its network, and that footage is shared only by users or in response to a legal request. Daniels reiterated what the company had previously told The Verge, that it has no partnerships with ICE or any other federal agency, and said you can see every request agencies have made on its Neighbors app profile.

Additionally, the Flock integration is not currently live, although Daniels had no update on the company’s plans for the partnership following the backlash. She referred me to an earlier response. “As we explore the integration, we will ensure the feature is built for the use of local public safety agencies only — which is what the program is designed for.”

History has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose

The problem is that there’s nothing preventing local agencies from sharing footage with federal ones. And while the Super Bowl ad played up heartwarming images of a girl reunited with her puppy, the leap to this technology that can track people in your neighborhood is still very small. Combined with government overreach, it’s not hard to imagine how a powerful network of AI-enabled cameras goes from finding lost dogs to hunting people.

And Ring has a history of partnering with the police. While it has rolled back some of that in recent years, since founder Jamie Siminoff returned, the company has renewed its focus on using its products to prevent crime.

Siminoff said he came back because of the possibilities AI brings. With this technology, he believes neighborhood cameras could be used to virtually “zero out crime” within a year. Given these stated goals and the new capabilities AI can bring, why wouldn’t Ring be planning to add some form of Search Party for People to its cameras?

Eliminating crime is an admirable goal, but history has shown that tools capable of large-scale surveillance are rarely limited to their original purpose. Ring has a responsibility here to protect its users, which it says it is doing. But ultimately, it comes down to how much you can trust a company – and the company it keeps – to never overstep. If Ring is cloaking its ambitions behind our instinct to protect our furry friends, that trust will be hard to find.

﻿CFO Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO until the company’s board finds a replacement.

Robert Playter, CEO of Boston Dynamics, announced on Tuesday that he is stepping down from his role effective immediately and leaving the company on February 27th, as previously reported by A3. Under Playter’s leadership, Boston Dynamics navigated its way through an acquisition from Softbank that brought it to Hyundai in 2021, and it launched a new all-electric version of its humanoid Atlas robot in 2024. Just a few days ago, the company posted another video of its research Atlas robots attempting tumbling passes and outdoor runs as more enterprise-ready editions start to roll out.

Boston Dynamics announced at CES last month that Atlas robots will begin working in Hyundai’s car plants starting in 2028, as the robotics field has become increasingly crowded by competitors like Tesla and Figure, as well as AI companies with “world model” tech built for robots.

Playter has been at Boston Dynamics for over 30 years and has served as CEO since 2020, replacing the company’s original CEO, Marc Raibert. Boston Dynamics CFO Amanda McMaster will serve as interim CEO while the company’s board of directors searches for Playter’s replacement.

“Boston Dynamics has been the ride of a lifetime. What this place has become has exceeded anything I could have ever imagined all those years ago in our funky lab in the basement of the MIT Media Lab,” Playter said in a letter to employees, which was shared with The Verge. He also highlighted the company’s successes with its Spot, Stretch, and Atlas robots.

“From the earliest days of hopping robots, to the world’s first quadrupeds, to spearheading the entire humanoid industry, Playter made his mark as a pioneer of innovation. He transformed Boston Dynamics from a small research and development lab into a successful business that now proudly calls itself the global leader in mobile robotics,” Nikolas Noel, VP of marketing and communications at Boston Dynamics, said in a statement to The Verge, adding, “He will be sorely missed, but we hope he enjoys some well-deserved time off. Thanks Rob.”

Plus: DC thinks Bezos is a bastard; Newsmax goes to war with Nexstar; and more in this week’s Regulator.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about tech politicking in the age of Trump. If you’re a subscriber, you are dominant and talented, like the Seattle Seahawks. If you’re not a subscriber yet, it’s time to get your act together, like the New England Patriots. (I’m from Boston and I’m allowed to say this.)

The biggest tech story dominating Washington right now is, incidentally, a media story. Last week, shortly after The Washington Post laid off 400 staffers and closed many of its desks, and before its absentee CEO Will Lewis got summarily shoved out, I wrote a column trying to figure out whether there was even a cynical, self-interested reason that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos continued to own the Post: Was it to support journalism, make money, or suck up to Donald Trump?

This weekend I learned of a discussion that would have both saved the Post money and supported several journalists, but never went through: After it was reported in late January that the Post was eyeing the elimination of the sports desk, the Washington City Paper, a renowned newspaper with deep roots in DC, had offered to purchase both the Post’s sports and local sections, thereby keeping those journalists employed.

Sources close to the discussion said Mark Ein, the owner of the City Paper and a part owner of the Washington Commanders, had approached then-CEO Lewis weeks ago with a proposal: They could instead spin sports and local into a separate entity that the City Paper would then invest in and host on its platform. (News organizations selling off sections and IPs is not an unheard-of phenomenon.)

Though Lewis was reportedly receptive, the discussions abruptly ended last Wednesday, when the Post closed those sections altogether and laid off the journalists who staffed them. In the case of the sports’ journalists, they were right in the middle of the Winter Olympics and about to cover the Super Bowl.

That decision hit particularly hard for longtime Washington Post readers: A generation of sports journalists had grown up on the Post’s coverage of local teams, and it was two local beat reporters that ended up breaking the Watergate scandal.

In response to an X post imploring him to hire the newly available Posties “to give this region the coverage it deserves,” Ein said that he was “on it.” The Washington Post did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the weekend, I hit up some more insiders from the worlds of journalism, tech, and the Trump gossip chains, all of whom had worked with Bezos and the Post, looking for answers. It turns out that they were just as confused as I was, and two of them allowed me to print their thoughts.

An executive who’s worked in journalism and philanthropy and worked with Bezos:

“The way I used to describe billionaires who own media properties is that they don’t want to write more checks, meaning they think the subsidy they’re providing is that they’re not asked for the paper to send them a check every year. All their other businesses give them dividends, right? But this one, they’re like, Fine. Just don’t lose money, and just don’t bug me anymore. They’re trying to rationalize the business by making it lose less money.

“So, him trying to make it lose less, that kind of makes sense. It’s just curious as to why he’s doing it at all. And what does it get out of it? Does he love the business? He’s never made a pronouncement so much as loving it. I think there’s part of the equation that isn’t solvable, at some level. And then that’s what people are filling in with, He wants influence with Trump or somehow wants us to have his other businesses. I’ve never heard him say anything like that. I’ve never heard anybody from The Washington Post assert anything like that. I’ve never seen evidence of it. But it’s sort of what you fill in the blank with, when the equation isn’t adding up. What I think is true is, it is irrational for him to own this thing.”

Kara Swisher, the tech journalist and host of Pivot, who put together a very public bid last year to purchase the Post but never heard back from Bezos. (Disclosure: Swisher’s podcast Pivot is produced by Vox Media.) Here’s her response in full:

“I have no idea except in some non botoxed part of his once sharp brain he thinks he is doing what it will take to preserve the Post for the long term. But I suspect, given how feral he has always been from the start, he wants to show fealty to Trump and at the same time smother it slowly to preserve his options to have a possible cudgel at the ready if need be.

This much is true: Bezos has always been about optionality and will do whatever it takes to further his interests. It would be so much better if he sold it and bought Vogue, but since he is 10 times wealthier than when he acquired the Post in 2013, why not have it all? Or maybe, just maybe, he’s just a jerk.”

Hmmm. An underappreciated fact about the layoffs, reported out first by Sara Fischer at Axios: Out of the 400 people laid off, 75 of them came from Arc XP, the Post’s tech publishing arm that was also funded by Bezos.

There’s a new type of growing backlash to Trump on the right, and it’s led by the cable network that had once been deeply loyal to him.

Today, Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the right-wing cable network Newsmax and a major Trump ally, testified in the Senate in opposition of the $6.2 billion Nexstar-Tegna merger, alongside several journalism nonprofits supporting local news. The deal would have required that the Federal Communications Commission, led by Chairman Brendan Carr, lift a regulatory cap that limited companies to only owning 39 percent of the television market. Should the deal go through the Senate, the Nexstar-Tegna entity would own 54 percent.

“It’s insane what they’re [Nexstar-Tegna] claiming,” Ruddy told me on the phone after the hearing. “First of all, they’re claiming that they’re increasing competition by consolidating a massive merger. And then they claim that they’re protecting local news. Local news is going to be decimated, and Nexstar has a history of firing journalists and consolidating newsrooms wherever they can.”

In his opening testimony, Ruddy argued that the merger would create even more corporate media consolidation and prevent independent, local, non-corporate companies from being able to enter the market. “With the collapse of local newspapers and the gutting of local radio due to prior consolidation, television now stands largely alone as the primary source of local news,” he stated, pointing out that even local news stories that go viral on tech platforms originate from local TV news. “When you raise the national ownership cap, you are eﬀectively saying that two or

three corporations should eventually own most or all television stations in America — and by extension, control local news. That is what consolidation truly means.”

Newsmax itself has some battle scars from similar deals: Although it’s the seventh-most-watched cable channel in the country according to Nielsen ratings, it’s also a frequent target of national media companies repeatedly undermining its ability to air across the country. As an example, Ruddy explicitly called out Nexstar for creating a knockoff and selling it for cheap:

“Nexstar also insists that cable operators carry its little-watched cable news channel, NewsNation. Last year, Newsmax delivered at least five times the ratings of NewsNation, yet cable operators were forced not only to carry NewsNation, but to pay license fees significantly higher than those paid to Newsmax. We hear a great deal about the free market. But this is not the free market. This is

market leverage and manipulation used to harm consumers and suppress competition — specifically competition from independent voices like Newsmax.”

In November 2025, Trump, whom Ruddy has donated to since 2016, vehemently blasted the deal on Truth Social, saying that it would “allow the Radical Left Networks to ‘enlarge,’” and therefore give mainstream media a tighter grip on the country: “NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!” But fast forward to last Saturday, and Trump suddenly changed his mind, writing on Truth Social that the merger would actually “help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level.”

So what changed? There’s a specific genre of “sucking up to Trump” that goes back to his first administration, when Trump was frequently mainlining cable news: Special interest groups would buy ads in specific television markets and run them on Fox News in the hopes that Trump was watching. And over the past few months — especially during college and pro football playoff games — I’ve been catching two very specific ads paid for by a group called Keep News Local, which appears to be directly asking Trump to support the Nexstar-Tegna merger. Their argument has a very Trumpian gloss: Over footage of the president, a voice-over claims that the merger would support “independent voices,” would “defeat the fake news media,” and was “crucial for MAGA to survive.” (The cherry on top: “President Trump defeated the fake news monopolies before through independent voices and local news.”)

Punchbowl reported last week that Keep News Local, which also ran a campaign on X, is a right-wing coalition that’s in favor of the merger, and includes Building America’s Future, a group backed by Elon Musk. I’ll weigh in by saying that this may be the least subtle influence campaign ad I’ve ever seen on Washington television. But subtlety hasn’t been part of Nexstar’s Trump strategy writ large; there was, after all, the time last September when they attempted to get Jimmy Kimmel Live! canceled, prompted by Carr attacking the late-night host after he made a joke related to the political fallout from Charlie Kirk’s death. Conversely, a counter-group called Keep It Local Media began pumping out its own ads against the deal.

Ruddy told me that while he was not affiliated with any of the political groups supporting or opposing the merger, he knew that the pro-merger groups were putting “a lot of money” into the campaign. That said, he couldn’t say whether they’d have the desired effect: “I think at the end of the day, Trump makes his own mind. I’m not sure he’s going to be influenced by an ad campaign.”

After several weeks of asking whether the Trump Phone (remember that?) was actually real, our very own Dominic Preston, who has reviewed many a smartphone in his time, managed to get Trump Mobile executives to at least show him the phone over Zoom. It will not, however, be “made in the USA” as promised — instead, the phones will go through “final assembly” in Miami.

TPUSA claims that its Super Bowl halftime show starring Kid Rock — MAGA counterprogramming to the NFL’s official Bad Bunny halftime show — drew 6.1 million concurrent viewers on YouTube TV.

Streaming numbers are still a fudgy art, but one thing’s for sure: That number would have been higher if they’d been able to livestream the show on Musk’s X. Alas, TPUSA had to cancel the X livestream at the last minute, and an insider told The Verge it was due to copyright and music licensing issues. Supposedly, one song was not cleared to be broadcast on the “everything app” due to an old clause grandfathered in from the days when it was Twitter.

My colleagues Charles Pulliam-Moore and Jess Weatherbed waded through the slop of Super Bowl generative AI ads, of which, apparently, there were too many. I would like to add my thoughts to the canon:

See you next week, and send all tips to every way that we list here.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/11/1132714/evs-africa-cost/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

For a few days recently, the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.

            <h2>Allonic is rebuilding robotics from the inside out</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.
