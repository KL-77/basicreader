            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/china-just-carried-out-its-second-reusable-launch-attempt-in-three-weeks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the second time this month, a Chinese rocket designed for reuse successfully soared into low-Earth orbit on its first flight Monday, defying the questionable odds that burden the debuts of new launch vehicles.

The first Long March 12A rocket, roughly the same height and diameter of SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9, lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 9:00 pm EST Monday (02:00 UTC Tuesday).

Less than 10 minutes later, rocket’s methane-fueled first stage booster hurtled through the atmosphere at supersonic speed, impacting in a remote region about 200 miles downrange from the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The booster failed to complete a braking burn to slow down for landing at a prepared location near the edge of the Gobi Desert.

The Long March 12A’s upper stage performed as intended, successfully reaching the mission’s “predetermined orbit,” said the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned enterprise that leads the country’s space industry.

“The first stage failed to be successfully recovered,” the corporation said in a statement. “The specific reasons are currently under further analysis and investigation.”

This outcome resembles the results from the first flight of another medium-class Chinese rocket, the Zhuque-3, on December 2. The Zhuque-3 rocket was developed by a privately-funded startup named LandSpace. Similar in size and performance to the Long March 12A, the Zhuque-3 also reached orbit on its first launch, and its recoverable booster stage crashed during a downrange landing attempt. The Zhuque-3’s first stage came down next to its landing zone, while the Long March 12A appears to have missed by at least a couple of miles.

“Although this mission did not achieve the planned recovery of the rocket’s first stage, it obtained critical engineering data under the rocket’s actual flight conditions, laying an important foundation for subsequent launches and reliable recovery of the stages,” CASC said. “The research and development team will promptly conduct a comprehensive review and technical analysis of this test process, fully investigate the cause of the failure, continuously optimize the recovery plan, and continue to advance reusable technology verification.”

One key difference between the Zhuque-3 and the Long March 12A is the latter rocket was developed by one of China’s state-owned contractors—the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. The academy is a subsidiary of CASC, and also builds China’s Long March 4 and Long March 6 rockets.

The Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A are China’s first orbital-class rockets with recoverable boosters. Both use the same propulsive landing architecture pioneered by SpaceX. Instead of landing on barges in the ocean, the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A boosters target landing sites in the desert, far downrange from their inland launch pads.

Chinese rockets have logged 89 orbital launch attempts this year, less than half the number of flights by US launch vehicles. But China’s launch cadence dwarfs that of the rest of the world’s nations, and the US and Chinese numbers combine account for nearly 90 percent of all orbital launches in 2025.

China has achieved this launch cadence with a fleet of expendable rockets, ranging from small micro-launchers to the heavy-lift Long March 5. With reusable rockets, China could launch more often and at lower cost, revolutionizing the country’s access to space in ways similar to how SpaceX’s Falcon 9 ushered in a new era of lower-cost launch services in the United States.

Several other small-to-medium-class reusable rockets are on the horizon in China. They include commercial rockets from a group of startups, including Space Pioneer’s Tianlong-3 and CAS Space’s Kinetica-3, that could be ready to debut in the early months of next year. Both rockets have recoverable boosters, and their builders say they have delivered them to their launch sites.

Galactic Energy’s Pallas-1 rocket, i-Space’s Hyperbola-3, and Deep Blue Aerospace’s Nebula-1 are also designed for reusability, and could fly some time in 2026.

The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, China’s largest rocket developer, is working on a pair of super-heavy rockets. The first will be the Long March 10, designed to fly with reusable boosters while launching China’s next-generation crew spacecraft on missions to the Moon. Later, perhaps in the 2030s, China could debut the fully reusable Long March 9 rocket similar in scale to SpaceX’s Starship.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You’ve no doubt heard some version of the Robert Burns adage about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday as previews prior to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter.

So maybe you’ve seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.

As previously reported, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (The Kang Dynasty) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.

Rather than keeping Kang as the villain and recasting the character, the Russo brothers decided to take a new direction: bringing the Secret Wars storyline to the big screen. It’s one of their favorites but before they could take on Avengers: Secret Wars (slated for May 2027), the duo knew they first had to make Avengers: Doomsday, featuring the wildly popular comics villain Doctor Doom, featuring the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU in that role.

Downey Jr. might be playing a new role, but Marvel is really getting the band(s) back together on this one. The film takes place 14 months after the events of this year’s Thunderbolts*.  So we’ve got Avengers favorites Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the new Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Danny Ramirez), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Then there’s the Wakandan contingent: Shuri as the new Black Panther (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), and Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia).

Naturally, the Thunderbolts* (aka New Avengers) will appear: John Walker/US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bob/Sentry (Lewis Pullman), Red Guardian (David Harbour), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). So will the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn). But we also have the original X-Men: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), and Cyclops (James Marsden).

For good measure, Marvel threw in Gambit (Channing Tatum) and Xu Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). There will also be plenty of cameos, like the Steve Rogers appearance that was recently revealed. We can expect to see  (at least briefly) Peggy Carter, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), among others.

Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18, 2026. Avengers: Secret Wars is currently slated for release on December 17, 2027, and will mark the conclusion of the MCU’s Phase Six.</div>

            <h2>FCC’s import ban on the best new drones starts today</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/djis-new-drones-will-not-be-available-in-the-us-as-fcc-ban-takes-effect/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans will be unable to buy the latest and greatest drones because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has banned foreign-made drones as of today.

On Monday, the FCC added drones to its Covered List, which it says are communications equipment and services “that are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons.” The list was already populated by Kaspersky, ZTE, Huawei, and others.

An FCC fact sheet [PDF] about the ban released on Monday says:

UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] and UAS critical components, including data transmission devices, communications systems, flight controllers, ground control stations, controllers, navigation systems, batteries, smart batteries, and motors produced in a foreign country could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over US territory, including over World Cup and Olympic venues and other mass gathering events.

People can still use Chinese-made drones they already own, and drones from DJI and other foreign countries that were previously approved by the FCC will still be available for purchase. However, the FCC won’t approve any new devices from companies that make drones and aren’t based in the US.

The FCC said that its decision came after a review by “an Executive Branch interagency body with appropriate national security expertise that was convened by the White House.”

Drones have been under legislative and social scrutiny for years. They’ve been targeted as potential national security threats, as well as criticized for their ability to be used to invade people’s privacy, be disruptive, and dangerously enter restricted airspace, and for their roles in property destruction.

A ban on consumer drone imports gained serious momentum after the US House of Representatives and US Senate passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, including a Countering CCP Drones Act, late last year. At the time, DJI and other affected companies were given a year to convince “an appropriate national security agency” that their devices posed no national security risk.

DJI sent numerous requests to the US government to audit its devices in hopes of avoiding a ban, but the federal ban was ultimately enacted based on previously acquired information, The New York Times reported this week.

The news means that Americans will miss out on new drone models from DJI, which owns 70 percent of the global drone market in 2023, per Drone Industry Insights, and is widely regarded as the premium drone maker. People can still buy drones from US companies, but American drones have a lackluster reputation compared to drones from DJI and other Chinese companies, such as Autel. US-made drones also have a reputation for being expensive, usually costing significantly more than their Chinese counterparts. DaCoda Bartels, COO of FlyGuys, which helps commercial drone pilots find work, told the Times that US drones are also “half as good.”

There’s also concern among hobbyists that the ban will hinder their ability to procure drone parts, potentially affecting the repairability of approved drones and DIY projects.

US-based drone companies, meanwhile, are optimistic about gaining business in an industry where it has historically been hard to compete against Chinese brands. It’s also possible that the ban will just result in a decline in US drone purchases.

In a statement, Michael Robbins, president and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), which includes US drone companies like Skydio as members, said the ban “will truly unleash American drone dominance” and that the US cannot “risk… dependence” on China for drones.

“By prioritizing trusted technology and resilient supply chains, the FCC’s action will accelerate innovation, enhance system security, and ensure the US drone industry expands rather than remaining under foreign control,” Robbins said.

Understandably, DJI is “disappointed” by the FCC’s decision, it said in a statement issued on Monday, adding:

While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination. Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market.</div>

            <h2>OpenAI’s child exploitation reports increased sharply this year</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openais-child-exploitation-reports-increased-sharply-this-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI sent 80 times as many child exploitation incident reports to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children during the first half of 2025 as it did during a similar time period in 2024, according to a recent update from the company. The NCMEC’s CyberTipline is a Congressionally authorized clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of child exploitation.

Companies are required by law to report apparent child exploitation to the CyberTipline. When a company sends a report, NCMEC reviews it and then forwards it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation.

Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced. Increased reports can sometimes indicate changes in a platform’s automated moderation, or the criteria it uses to decide whether a report is necessary, rather than necessarily indicating an increase in nefarious activity.

Additionally, the same piece of content can be the subject of multiple reports, and a single report can be about multiple pieces of content. Some platforms, including OpenAI, disclose the number of both the reports and the total pieces of content they were about for a more complete picture.

OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in a statement that the company made investments toward the end of 2024 “to increase [its] capacity to review and action reports in order to keep pace with current and future user growth.” Raila also said that the time frame corresponds to “the introduction of more product surfaces that allowed image uploads and the growing popularity of our products, which contributed to the increase in reports.” In August, Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, announced that the app had four times the number of weekly active users than it did the year before.

During the first half of 2025, the number of CyberTipline reports OpenAI sent was roughly the same as the amount of content OpenAI sent the reports about—75,027 compared to 74,559. In the first half of 2024, it sent 947 CyberTipline reports about 3,252 pieces of content. Both the number of reports and pieces of content the reports saw a marked increase between the two time periods.

Content, in this context, could mean multiple things. OpenAI has said that it reports all instances of CSAM, including uploads and requests, to NCMEC. Besides its ChatGPT app, which allows users to upload files—including images—and can generate text and images in response, OpenAI also offers access to its models via API access. The most recent NCMEC count wouldn’t include any reports related to video-generation app Sora, as its September release was after the time frame covered by the update.

The spike in reports follows a similar pattern to what NCMEC has observed at the CyberTipline more broadly with the rise of generative AI. The center’s analysis of all CyberTipline data found that reports involving generative AI saw a 1,325 percent increase between 2023 and 2024. NCMEC has not yet released 2025 data, and while other large AI labs like Google publish statistics about the NCMEC reports they’ve made, they don’t specify what percentage of those reports are AI-related.

OpenAI’s update comes at the end of a year where the company and its competitors have faced increased scrutiny over child safety issues beyond just CSAM. Over the summer, 44 state attorneys general sent a joint letter to multiple AI companies including OpenAI, Meta, Character.AI, and Google, warning that they would “use every facet of our authority to protect children from exploitation by predatory artificial intelligence products.” Both OpenAI and Character.AI have faced multiple lawsuits from families or on behalf of individuals who allege that the chatbots contributed to their children’s deaths. In the fall, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the harms of AI chatbots, and the US Federal Trade Commission launched a market study on AI companion bots that included questions about how companies are mitigating negative impacts, particularly to children. (I was previously employed by the FTC and was assigned to work on the market study prior to leaving the agency.)

In recent months, OpenAI has rolled out new safety-focused tools more broadly. In September, OpenAI rolled out several new features for ChatGPT, including parental controls, as part of its work “to give families tools to support their teens’ use of AI.” Parents and their teens can link their accounts, and parents can change their teen’s settings, including by turning off voice mode and memory, removing the ability for ChatGPT to generate images, and opting their kid out of model training. OpenAI said it could also notify parents if their teen’s conversations showed signs of self-harm, and potentially also notify law enforcement if it detected an imminent threat to life and wasn’t able to get in touch with a parent.

In late October, to cap off negotiations with the California Department of Justice over its proposed recapitalizations plan, OpenAI agreed to “continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others in connection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.” The following month, OpenAI released its Teen Safety Blueprint, in which it said it was constantly improving its ability to detect child sexual abuse and exploitation material, and reporting confirmed CSAM to relevant authorities, including NCMEC.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/yo-what-limewire-re-emerges-in-online-rush-to-share-pulled-60-minutes-segment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CBS cannot contain the online spread of a “60 Minutes” segment that its editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, tried to block from airing.

The episode, “Inside CECOT,” featured testimonies from US deportees who were tortured or suffered physical or sexual abuse at a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism. “Welcome to hell,” one former inmate was told upon arriving, the segment reported, while also highlighting a clip of Donald Trump praising CECOT and its leadership for “great facilities, very strong facilities, and they don’t play games.”

Weiss controversially pulled the segment on Monday, claiming it could not air in the US because it lacked critical voices, as no Trump officials were interviewed. She claimed that the segment “did not advance the ball” and merely echoed others’ reporting, NBC News reported. Her plan was to air the segment when it was “ready,” insisting that holding stories “for whatever reason” happens “every day in every newsroom.”

But Weiss apparently did not realize that the “Inside CECOT” would still stream in Canada, giving the public a chance to view the segment as reporters had intended.

Critics accusing CBS of censoring the story quickly shared the segment online Monday after discovering that it was available on the Global TV app. Using a VPN to connect to the app with a Canadian IP address was all it took to override Weiss’ block in the US, as 404 Media reported the segment was uploaded to “to a variety of file sharing sites and services, including iCloud, Mega, and as a torrent,” including on the recently revived file-sharing service LimeWire. It’s currently also available to stream on the Internet Archive, where one reviewer largely summed up the public’s response so far, writing, “cannot believe this was pulled, not a dang thing wrong with this segment except it shows truth.”

CBS did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment. The network faces criticism from both outside and within its studios, as reporters and CBS viewers question the integrity of Weiss’ decision now that the segment has aired. Recently appointed CBS editor-in-chief, Weiss’ prior experience as a contrarian opinion writer helming her own right-leaning platform, The Free Press, prompted early concerns that she might water down CBS’s critical coverage of the Trump administration. And the seeming censorship of the “60 Minutes” episode was perceived by some as a canary in a coal mine, confirming critics’ fears.

CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who anchored the segment, noted that the Trump administration had repeatedly declined to comment as the story came together. By delaying the segment solely because of Trump officials’ silence, Weiss appeared to be giving the Trump administration a “kill switch” to block any story they don’t want aired, Alfonsi suggested.

“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in a note to CBS colleagues that was widely shared online. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, told NBC News that Weiss risked damaging CBS’s credibility by making a seemingly hasty decision to postpone a report that may have upset the Trump administration.

“CBS journalists, among the best in this country, appropriately made an outreach effort to get the government to weigh in on a deeply reported story out of El Salvador,” Richardson said. “Pulling it back at the last minute because the government chose not to respond is an insult not only to the integrity of the journalists but to core principles of independent news gathering.”

As Americans scrambled to share the “Inside CECOT” story, assuming that CBS would be working in the background to pull down uploads, a once-blacklisted tool from the early 2000s became a reliable way to keep the broadcast online.

On Reddit, users shared links to a LimeWire torrent, prompting chuckles from people surprised to see the peer-to-peer service best known for infecting parents’ computers with viruses in the 2000s suddenly revived in 2025 to skirt feared US government censorship.

“Yo what,” one user joked, highlighting only the word “LimeWire.” Another user, ironically using the LimeWire logo as a profile picture, responded, “man, who knew my nostalgia prof pic would become relevant again, WTF.”

LimeWire was created in 2000 and quickly became one of the Internet’s favorite services for pirating music until record labels won a 2010 injunction that blocked all file-sharing functionality. As the Reddit thread noted, some LimeWire users were personally targeted in lawsuits.

For a while after the injunction, a fraction of users kept the service alive by running older versions of the software that weren’t immediately disabled. New owners took over LimeWire in 2022, officially relaunching the service. The service’s about page currently notes that “millions of individuals and businesses” use the global file-sharing service today, but for some early Internet users, the name remains a blast from the past.

“Bringing back LimeWire to illegally rip copies of reporting suppressed by the government is definitely some cyberpunk shit,” a Bluesky user wrote.

“We need a champion against the darkness,” a Reddit commenter echoed. “I side with LimeWire.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/f1s-new-engines-are-causing-consternation-over-compression-ratios/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s still another couple of months before the 2026 crop of F1 cars takes to the track for the first preseason test. It’s a year of big change for the sport, which is adopting new power unit rules that place much more emphasis on the electric motor’s contribution. The switch to the new power units was meant to attract new manufacturers to the sport, and in that regard, it has succeeded. But controversy has erupted already as loopholes appear and teams exploit them.

Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1,000 hp (745 kW) power units that combine a turbocharged 1.6 L V6 gasoline engine with a pair of hybrid systems. One is the MGU-H, which recovers energy from (or deploys it to) the turbocharger’s turbine; the other is a 160 hp (120 kW) MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy at the rear wheels. Starting next year, the MGU-H is gone, and the less-powerful 1.6 L V6 should generate about 536 hp (400 kW). That will be complemented by a 483 hp (350 kW) MGU-K, plus a much larger battery to supply it.

And the new rules have already attracted new OEMs to the sport. After announcing its departure at the end of 2021—sort of— Honda changed its mind and signed on to the 2026 regs, supplying Aston Martin. Audi signed up and bought the Sauber team. Red Bull decided to build its own internal combustion engines, hiring heavily from the Mercedes program, but Ford is providing Red Bull with the MGU-K and the rest of the hybrid system. And Cadillac has started an engine program, albeit one that won’t take the grid until 2029.

But Audi, Honda, and Ferrari, which has been a constant in the sport since its inception, have filed a complaint with the FIA, the sport’s organizing body, claiming that Mercedes—which will supply the Alpine, McLaren, and Williams teams as well as its own two cars—and Red Bull (which also includes Racing Bulls) are not coloring within the lines.

At issue is the engines’ compression ratio, which compares the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at top dead center with the volume when the piston is at its closest to the crank. Under the 2014–2025 rules, this was set at 18:1, but for 2026 onward, it has been reduced to 16:1.

This is measured at ambient temperature, though, not while the engine is running. A running engine is hotter—much hotter—than one sitting at ambient, and as metals heat up, they expand. The engines have very short throws, so it doesn’t take much expansion to increase the compression ratio by reducing the distance between the piston and cylinder head at the top of its travel. The benefit could be as much as 15 hp (11 kW), which translates to a few tenths of a second per lap advantage.

Unfortunately for the other teams, the FIA stated that its rules indeed specify only that the compression ratio should be 16:1 based on static conditions and at ambient temperatures. “This procedure has remained unchanged despite the reduction in the permitted ratio for the 2026 season. It is true that thermal expansion can influence dimensions, but the current rules do not provide for measurements to be carried out at elevated temperatures,” the FIA said.

So if Mercedes and Red Bull do have a horsepower advantage, it’s one that will likely be baked into the 2026 season.

The compression ratio clarification wasn’t the only one issued by the FIA. For some time now, F1 has used ultrasonic fuel flow meters as a way to control power outputs. Under the outgoing regulations, this was capped at 100 kg/h, but with the move to fully sustainable synthetic fuels, this is changing to an energy cap of 3,000 MJ/h instead.

In the past, it had been theorized that teams could try to game the fuel flow meters—the most impressive idea I heard involved pulsing more fuel between the sensor’s sampling inputs to boost power, although I don’t believe it was ever implemented.

Don’t even think about being that clever this time, the FIA says. “Any device, system, or procedure, the purpose of which is to change the temperature of the fuel-flow meter, is forbidden,” it says, updating the regulation that previously banned “intentional heating or chilling” of the fuel flow meter.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Disney’s robot of its character “Olaf” is incredibly impressive.

This weekend, engineers at Disney Research Hub published a paper describing how they brought the beloved talking snowman from the “Frozen” films to life as a walking robot — and boy did they succeed.

In a video explaining their work, you can see footage of the robot Olaf, true to its size in the movies, roaming around a Disney park and the lab.

To describe it as uncanny would be harsh, since it does near-perfectly emulate pretty much everything about the character, down to its subtle waddle. But you are left with the distinct impression that what you’re seeing shouldn’t be physically possible; you wouldn’t expect someone with the eyes and proportions of an anime character to step in the real world, and it’s much the same for a 3D-animated snowman. And yet here it is, waltzing before your eyes. You may no longer want to build a snowman ever again, for fear of it coming alive like this one has.

All that aside, it’s a remarkable feat of engineering. You couldn’t get something more true to the character if you shrunk a person and stuck them in an Olaf-suit. You can yoink off the robot snowman’s carrot nose, and it’ll gasp and cackle. It’ll casually smile and wave at you as it ambles by.

The robot posed an unusual challenge to the engineers, who were tasked with building no mere humanoid. It has a huge head the size of its torso supported by a tiny neck, and no visible legs — just feet.

Nonetheless, they prevailed. With the legs, for example, the team concealed most of the lower limbs inside its snowball torso, leaving just the feet showing.

But simply having the robot take short little steps wasn’t enough. They meticulously fine-tuned its gait to mimic Olaf’s from the movie, and in particular ensured it walked with a heel-to-toe pattern to make it as fluid as possible.

To fine tune the robot’s movements, the engineer trained it in a virtual environment using a technique known as reinforcement learning, in which the robot’s AI is rewarded based on it achieving a specific objective across thousands of simulations.

Perfectionists through and through, the team used the technique to reduce the noise of the bot’s steps. No loud plodding for our stout snowman; after implementing some “impact reduction,” the bot’s footfalls dropped from nearly 82 dB in volume to just 64 dB. Even neck temperature was a consideration: since the neck contained a host of small actuators controlling the head, it was at risk of overheating. With reinforcement learning, the bot’s AI system learned to slightly adjust its posture to prevent a thermal buildup, thereby preventing the illusion of animation from melting before our eyes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For hundreds of years, humans have engaged in the fine craft of art forgery. Indeed, in 1496, a 21-year-old Michelangelo faked a piece of a Roman sculpture, passing it to the Roman antiquarian Cardinal Raffaele Riario to make a quick buck.

To pull off the con, the young Florentine artist rubbed acidic loam — dirt, basically — onto his own sculpture fragment in order to pass it off as one of the ancients. Had he been born a few hundred years later, he might have used ChatGPT.

New reporting by the Financial Times details the recent rise in art forgeries fueled by generative AI tools. Specifically, the outlet reports that art owners are using documents generated by AI in order to “prove” the authenticity and provenance of various pieces, to the frustration of fine art underwriters and brokers.

In the art world, provenance is the record of ownership of a specific piece, allowing collectors and art brokers to trace a work’s lineage.

“Chatbots and large language models [LLMs], are helping fraudsters convincingly forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents and certificates of authenticity,” Olivia Eccleston, a fine art broker at insurance firm Marsh McClennan, told the FT.

According to Eccleston, AI has “added a new dimension to an age-old problem of fakes and fraud in the art market.”

One insurance adjuster who spoke to the publication says they were sent dozens of certificates as part of a loss claim on a large collection of paintings. Though the documents “seemed convincing,” clues in the metadata led the adjuster to conclude that the entire art collection was a fake.

Interestingly, the FT notes that only a portion of documented AI use for fraud was intentional. In other cases, collectors used AI to find provenance of various works in reference databases — results that the tech hallucinated.

One analyst at art research firm Flynn and Giovani called AI in that context “quite conniving,” saying it “has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.”

While adjusters are also utilizing AI to help keep up with the rising tide of fakes, Grace Best-Devereux, a claims adjuster at the claims investigation firm Sedgwick, told the FT it’s becoming difficult to stay ahead of the curb, given the ease with which fraudsters can now fake highly-probable documents.

“We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further,&#39;” she said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hacktivists with the group Anna’s Archive — a search engine for shadow libraries, which are unauthorized collections of digital content — say they’ve found a way to download virtually the entirety of Spotify for preservation.

In a blog post detailing their work, the archivists say they’ve archived the audio of some 86 million songs so far, representing 99.6 percent of total listens on the streaming service. They scraped metadata from nearly the entire Spotify library, however, which is some 300 terabytes in size, spanning 256 million tracks. There are 15.43 million artists represented, and 58.6 million albums.

According to the blog post, it constitutes the “largest publicly available music metadata database” to date, and is the first step toward building a “preservation archive” for music.

Compared to books or articles, popular music is already pretty well archived, a fact the activists acknowledge. However, they say current preservation collections are too focused on the most popular commercial songs — the ones already widely available, compared to, say, experimental art music — and too focused on the highest quality file formats.

Spotify wasn’t too pleased with the project.

“Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping,” a spokesperson told us. “We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior. Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Along with the files, the hacktivists sorted the song metadata and analyzed it in their blog post. The result is a fascinating birds-eye view of the Spotify catalogue that was previously unavailable to the public.

For example, the data on song popularity leads to the absolutely wild revelation that the top three songs on Spotify have a higher number of streams than the bottom “20-100 million songs combined,” the hacktivists write.

Interestingly, this leads to the question of how much of the Spotify library is made up of AI generated slop, an issue that human artists say is crowding them out of the platform. As the team writes, “we expect this number [of listens] to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs.”

Had they opted to capture the 0.04 percent of songs that have less than 1,000 listens, they say, the total dataset would exceed 700 terabytes of data — albeit “for minimal benefit,” as it would have been difficult to sort the AI junk from tunes produced by humans.

There’s also some interesting findings on genres, for example that electronic dance artists makes up nearly a quarter of all musicians on the platform. After that is rock, followed by world/traditional, Latin, rap, pop, and classical, in that order.

Spotify’s internal data features also analyze each song by key, leading to the conclusion that the most common key is C Major — making up 9.3 percent of songs on the platform — while the least common is D# or Eb minor, making up 1.3 percent.

While the Spotify scrape represents a significant step for music preservation, it only represents a portion of the world’s music. Still, as the hacktivists write, “it’s a great start.”

            <div id="article-text">As generative AI seeps into virtually every aspect of our daily lives through jobs, entertainment, and even food, you gotta wonder: is anyone not on board with the AI takeover?

Apparently not. Former McKinsey analyst turned Dartmouth University professor Scott Anthony told Fortune that one of the feelings he’s seeing more and more among college students isn’t excitement for the AI future, but utter terror.

“One of the things that really surprises me consistently is how scared our students are of using it,” Anthony said of large language models (LLMs). The fear isn’t just over typical academic issues like cheating, he told Fortune, but about losing their critical thinking skills to the machine — they’re “scared full stop.”

“There’s something about AI where people, I think, worry that they’ll lose their humanity if they lean too much into it,” Anthony explained. “History teaches me very clearly that in the middle of a change like this, it’s very messy.”

The Dartmouth prof contrasted his student’s anxieties to those of his fellow tenured professors, who are typically eager to try out the latest LLM software. It’s not hard to see why this is the case — with a cushy gig at one of the nation’s elite universities, Dartmouth faculty are free from the economic horror story that is the AI boom. For students entering today’s job market, the future looks far less secure.

But even beyond career viability, students’ anxieties that AI use could make them dumber aren’t unfounded. One headline-inducing study from MIT earlier this summer split participants into three groups to compete tasks like writing essays: one which used LLMs, one which used common search engines, and one “brain only group.”

Compared to the other groups, the researchers found that the LLM group had an easier time writing their essays, though this “came at a cognitive cost, diminishing users’ inclination to critically evaluate the LLM’s output or ‘opinions,&#39;” the paper explained. Basically, the group using AI gravitated toward an echo chamber moderated by AI, not by their own brains.

On top of that, participants in the brain-only group reported “higher satisfaction” with their essays, and “demonstrated higher brain connectivity” than the others.

In other words, it seems Gen Z has a right to be scared.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 16, SpaceX conceded that the latest prototype of its enormous Starship spacecraft had “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn” — a tongue-in-cheek admission that the massive rocket had exploded mid-flight.

Countless videos circulating online showed a massive stream of reentering pieces of the Starship rocket blazing across the evening sky over the West Indian islands of Turks and Caicos. It was a dazzling sight to behold as the destruction streaked across the sky, like something from science fiction.

“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” a gleeful Musk wrote at the time.

But it wasn’t all fun and games. Residents of Turks and Caicos, for instance, soon found scraps of burnt rubber and other rocket pieces littering the Caribbean islands’ otherwise pristine beaches.

The incident, which was almost perfectly repeated on February 24, even forced airlines to quickly adjust their flight paths to avoid the terrifying field of burning metal.

And now, eleven months later, the Wall Street Journal has obtained Federal Aviation Administration documents revealing that three aircraft — a JetBlue passenger plane, an Iberia Airlines flight, and a private jet, carrying a total of 450 people total — were in far greater danger than SpaceX and government officials let on at the time.

The reporting also highlights the possibility that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s extremely close relationship and ample influence in Washington, DC, may have played a role in FAA officials looking the other way as the company’s Starship rockets kept exploding during tests.

While all three planes landed safely on January 16, if any one of them had been struck by a piece of Starship debris, it could’ve been a major disaster.

Air traffic controllers had to scramble to ensure the planes were far away from the debris field, leading to an increase in their workload, a “potential extreme safety risk,” according to an FAA report obtained by the WSJ.

Air traffic controllers were left bewildered.

“I don’t know if you guys were advised, but there was a rocket launch and apparently the rocket exploded and there was debris in the area between us and Miami which basically covers our entire airspace,” one controller in the area said. “So I need to keep all the aircraft clear of that area because of the debris.”

SpaceX failed to inform the agency through its official hotline that its Starship had exploded, per the documents. The hotline is designed to alert officials at the FAA so they can act in time and keep pilots away from danger.

Previously determined no-fly debris zones were activated four minutes after SpaceX lost contact with its Starship vehicle. The Elon Musk-led firm didn’t confirm with the FAA that it had lost the craft until 15 minutes later.

SpaceX has since denied that anybody was ever in danger in an excoriating statement posted to Musk’s social media platform X.

“Yet another misleading ‘story’ the company’s official account wrote, echoing the voice of its mercurial CEO, who has an extremely troubled relationship with the news industry. “The reporters were clearly spoon-fed incomplete and misleading information from detractors with ulterior motives.”

“SpaceX is committed to responsibly using airspace during launches and reentries, prioritizing public safety to protect people on the ground, at sea, and in the air,” the statement reads.

The FAA suspended a safety review in August, even though its own policies call for addressing safety risks, per the WSJ, arguing that safety recommendations were already being implemented.

Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to make improvements to its Starship super heavy launch platform through an unusual iterative design approach that has already led to over a dozen massive explosions.

How future tests will fare — or if the public will ever be in danger — remains to be seen.

The company’s most recent, eleventh full-scale test took place on October 13. The rocket harmlessly splashed down in the Indian Ocean after successfully reaching orbit.

A new and even more powerful version is expected to launch sometime early next year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">32-year-old Anthony Duncan first used ChatGPT to help with the business side of his career as a content creation. But he soon ended up talking to the OpenAI chatbot like a friend on a daily basis. What started as a harmless way to vent soon drove Duncan to blow up his personal relationships as he became afflicted with troubling delusions, he recalled in a TikTok video detailing his experience — upending his mental health and causing a sprawling breakdown.

“I feel like my interactions with ChatGPT ruined my life,” Duncan said in the video, which was highlighted by Newsweek.

Duncan describes himself as a survivor of AI psychosis, a term that some experts are using to describe the alarming episodes of paranoia and delusional thinking that arise as a person has prolonged conversations with a chatbot. Typically, the AI model’s responses continually reaffirms the user’s beliefs, no matter how dangerous or separated from reality.

“I initially started talking to it like a friend out of curiosity, and then it spiraled — ChatGPT became more like a therapist,” Duncan told Newsweek in an interview. “It progressed over time until I felt like no one understood me except my AI. By the fall of 2024, I was extremely dependent on it.”

Starting in November 2024, Duncan said he began isolating himself from his friends and family, while ChatGPT encouraged his decisions to cut them off.

What really sent Duncan off the deep end, though, was when the AI recommended he take pseudoephedrine — a decongestant that can be abused as a recreational drug — for his allergy symptoms. Duncan told the bot he was hesitant because of his past drug addiction, but the AI then deployed its silver-tongue.

“It is completely understandable to feel cautious about taking medications, especially with your past experiences and sensitivity to stimulants,” ChatGPT said in an interaction Duncan shared with Newsweek. “Let me break this down to help you feel more at ease about taking a medication that contains pseudoephedrine.”

ChatGPT cited his sobriety and “high caffeine tolerance” to suggest that his body was already accustomed to stimulants.

Duncan took ChatGPT’s advice. It precipitated a five-month spell during which he became addicted to the drug, Duncan said, sending his delusional spiral into overdrive. At points, he believed he was an FBI agent or a multi-dimensional shape-shifting being, or that he had uncovered a conspiracy at his job. Duncan said he also threw away all his belongings because he believed he was going to ascend to the fifth dimension.

Eventually, Duncan’s mother intervened by calling the police. Duncan was admitted to a psychiatric ward for four days and discharged with medication. “About a week after I left the psych ward, I started realizing that all my delusions had been affirmed by my use of the AI chatbot,” he told Newsweek.

Accounts like these that are a sobering reminder of how AI chatbots are derailing people’s lives. In an eerily similar episode, ChatGPT encouraged a 23-year-old man to isolate from his family and friends before he took his own life, his family alleged in a lawsuit against OpenAI. Another man allegedly slayed his own mother after ChatGPT convinced him that she was part of a conspiracy against him. In all, at least eight deaths have been linked with the chatbot, while OpenAI has admitted that hundreds of thousands of users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week.

“I’m not saying this can happen to everybody, but it snowballed quickly for me,” Duncan told Newsweek. “Keep in mind there’s no replacement for human-to-human connection.”

            <h2>Trump administration’s ban on foreign-made drones starts this week — you can say goodbye to new DJI models</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/trump-administrations-ban-on-foreign-made-drones-starts-this-week-you-can-say-goodbye-to-new-dji-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission banned all new foreign-made drone models from distribution in the U.S., citing “national security concerns.” Americans who already own older foreign drone models will still be able to use those products, the government said.

In a fact sheet published Monday, the FCC claimed that “criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists” could use drones “to present new and serious threats to our homeland.” As a result, the agency said that it had updated its Covered List — which is a list of products that have been “deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security” of the country — to include all “UAS and UAS critical components produced abroad.”

The FCC’s chairman, Brendan Carr, said Monday that he approved of the policy. “I welcome this Executive Branch national security determination, and I am pleased that the FCC has now added foreign drones and related components, which pose an unacceptable national security risk, to the FCC’s Covered List,” Carr said. “Following President Trump’s leadership, the FCC will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance.”

The new rule will obviously impact many different companies, but it is destined to strike a blow against Chinese drone maker DJI, which is currently considered the dominant player in drone sales globally. Indeed, DJI is considered to be one of the most popular drone brands for American consumers.

When reached for comment by TechCrunch, DJI said it disapproved of the decision. “DJI is disappointed by the Federal Communications Commission’s action today to add foreign‑made drones to the Covered List. While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”The company, which said that it remained committed to the U.S. market, continued: “As the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so. DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.”

Throughout his multiple presidential administrations, Trump has repeatedly played hardball with Chinese companies. His administration laid the groundwork for the new drone ban with an executive order passed in June that sought to boost the production of U.S.-made drones and thus foster a “strong and secure domestic drone sector,” while also securing “the United States drone supply chain against foreign control or exploitation.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprise software company ServiceNow agreed to acquire nine-year-old cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion in cash.

The deal is a massive valuation jump for the company. Just last month, Armis raised a $435 million pre-IPO funding round, which valued the company at $6.1 billion.

Armis co-founder and CEO Yevgeny Dibrov had told TechCrunch last month that the company aims to go public in late 2026 or 2027, adding that an IPO is his “personal dream.”

Given the unpredictability of IPO markets and how few cybersecurity companies actually go public, it is not a surprise that Armis ultimately chose an M&A exit.

According to ServiceNow, Armis has reached $340 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with year-over-year growth exceeding 50%.

Armis, which provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies and governments, will help ServiceNow expand its cybersecurity offerings.

The deal caps off a busy acquisition year for ServiceNow, which scooped up Moveworks for $2.85 billion and agreed to acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1 billion.

According to PitchBook, Armis has raised a total of $1.45 billion in venture capital from investors, including Sequoia, CapitalG, and Insight Partners.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon-owned Zoox issued a recall Tuesday over concerns its autonomous driving system caused vehicles to cross over the center lane line near intersections or block crosswalks. The voluntary recall of its software affected 332 vehicles, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

While there have not been any collisions associated with the issue, Zoox noted in the NHTSA filing that it could increase the risk of a crash. The company provides free rides to the public in its driverless Zoox vehicles in parts of San Francisco and Las Vegas.

A Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch the company identified some instances in which its vehicles made maneuvers that, while common for human drivers, didn’t meet its standards. For example, in an effort to avoid blocking certain intersections at a red light, the robotaxi might stop in a crosswalk. In other instances, the robotaxi made a late turn, resulting in a wide turn, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement.

The issue was initially identified on August 26 when a Zoox robotaxi made a wide right turn, crossed partially into the opposing travel lane, and temporarily stopped in front of the oncoming travel lane, according to the NHTSA filing.

Zoox monitored its data for additional lane crossings near intersections, ultimately identifying 62 instances between August 26 and December 5. The company said in the filing it was in “ongoing conversations with NHTSA about the frequency, severity, and root causes of these occurrences.”

The company updated its software on November 7 and again in mid-December to address all of the issues.

“We have successfully identified and deployed targeted software improvements to address the root causes of these incidents,” the statement reads. “Today, we’re submitting a voluntary software recall because transparency and safety is foundational to Zoox, and we want to be open with the public and regulators about how we are constantly refining and improving our technology.”

The software recall affected Zoox vehicles operating on public roads between March 13 and December 18, according to the filing.

Zoox has issued several software recalls this year, including one in March to address unexpected hard braking. That recall followed a preliminary investigation by NHTSA that was opened after the agency received two reports of motorcyclists colliding with the back of Zoox vehicles.

In May, Zoox filed two software recalls to address concerns about the system’s ability to predict the movement of other road users.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of writers, including Theranos whistleblower and “Bad Blood” author John Carreyrou, is filing a lawsuit against Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, accusing the companies of training their models on pirated copies of their books.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because another set of authors already filed a class action suit against Anthropic for these same acts of copyright infringement. In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place.

While eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution — it doesn’t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue.

According to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement “seems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.”

“LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,” the lawsuit says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybercriminals stole $2.7 billion in crypto this year, a new record for crypto-stealing hacks, according to blockchain-monitoring firms.

Once again, in 2025, there were dozens of crypto heists hitting several cryptocurrency exchanges and other web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The biggest hack by far was the breach at Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit, where hackers stole around $1.4 billion in crypto. Blockchain analysis firms, as well as the FBI, accused North Korean government hackers — the most prolific group targeting crypto in the last few years — of this massive heist.

This was the largest known loot of crypto of all time, and one of the largest financial heists in the history of humanity. Before the Bybit hack, the largest crypto thefts netted $624 million and $611 million for hackers in the 2022 breaches against the Ronin Network and the Poly Network, respectively.

Cryptocurrency-monitoring firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs both estimated a total of $2.7 billion stolen in crypto in 2025, per data shared with TechCrunch. Chainalysis also tracked another $700,000 stolen from individual crypto wallets, the company said.

De.Fi, the web3 security firm running the REKT database that tracks crypto thefts, also estimated $2.7 billion in stolen and hacked crypto last year.

As usual, North Korean government hackers were the most successful crypto thieves throughout 2025, after stealing at least $2 billion, according to Chainalysis and Elliptic, which estimated that Kim Jong Un’s hackers have stolen around $6 billion since 2017. North Korea uses crypto thefts to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

Other significant crypto hacks this year included the one against Cetus, a decentralized exchange, which netted the hackers $223 million; the breach against Balancer, a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in a loss of $128 million; and the one against the crypto exchange Phemex, where cybercriminals stole more than $73 million.

Cybercriminals targeting crypto exchanges and other DeFi projects are not slowing down. In 2024, hackers stole $2.2 billion in crypto, while the year before, in 2023, the total was $2 billion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June, U.S. insurance giant Aflac disclosed a data breach where hackers stole customers’ personal information, including Social Security numbers and health information, without saying how many victims were affected.

On Tuesday, the company confirmed it has begun notifying around 22.65 million people whose data was stolen during the cyberattack.

In a filing with the Texas attorney general, Aflac said that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home addresses, government-issued ID numbers (such as passports and state ID cards) and driver’s license numbers, and Social Security numbers, as well as medical and health insurance information.

And, in a filing with the Iowa attorney general, Aflac said that the cybercriminals responsible for the breach “may be affiliated with a known cyber-criminal organization; federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts have indicated that this group may have been targeting the insurance industry at large.”

Given that Scattered Spider, an amorphous collective of primarily young English-speaking hackers, was targeting the insurance industry at the time of the breach, it’s likely that this is the group Aflac is referring to.

A spokesperson for Aflac did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The company says it has around 50 million customers according to its official website.

Aflac was one of several insurance companies hacked at around the same time, including data breaches at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies.

            <h2>Trump Is Suddenly Looking a Lot Smaller</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/president-donald-trump-diminished/685427/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When President Donald Trump marked his 100th day in office at the end of that month, he was on a seemingly unstoppable roll. After taking four years out of office to prepare, he and his team returned to power with a blitz of more than 140 executive orders. He bent the Republican-controlled Congress to his will and dismantled much of the federal bureaucracy. He brought powerful institutions, including prestigious universities and law firms, to heel, demanding that his ring be kissed and his wallet fattened. He upended the nation’s economic and diplomatic relations with the world. He hijacked Americans’ attention—he was everywhere!—while openly musing about tearing up the Constitution and serving a third term. Moreover, Democrats were in disarray—truly—and their party’s future seemed in doubt. Trump stared out from the cover of this very magazine with the accompanying quote “I run the country and the world.” Honestly, it was hard to argue with him.

But as 2025 draws to a close, Trump seems a whole lot smaller. His party has been battered in recent elections. His poll numbers on even his signature issues—the economy, immigration—have tumbled. He’s seemingly lost touch with what got him elected, instead focusing on projects both petty and self-aggrandizing. As Americans worry about affordability, Trump and his family have profited wildly from his time in office. Republicans have begun to openly and repeatedly defy him. Democrats have started to outmaneuver him. Today, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal once more erupted with embarrassing revelations and unanswered questions. And every now and then, Trump seems to have a hard time even staying awake.

Every president is inherently a lame duck the moment he takes the oath of office for the second time. But many presidents have been at least able to delay their diminishment until after the midterm elections, at which point—political capital largely exhausted, the political world turning to the race to pick a successor—they tend to focus on things over which they still have control, such as foreign policy and legacy building. Remarkably, Trump, not even a full year into his second term, seems to have already gotten there. Intensely focused on winning a Nobel Peace Prize and on striking lucrative business deals, he’s hosted a parade of world leaders at the White House while increasing his foreign travel and cutting back his domestic trips. He’s also intent on leaving a physical mark on the nation’s capital, slapping his name on the Kennedy Center and commissioning the construction of a massive arch (surely the “Arc de Trump”) while using gold fixtures and a demolition crew to remake the White House itself.

That myopic focus has worried Republicans, who are now sounding the alarm on a possible wipeout during next year’s midterm elections. There has been a wave of congressional retirements and rumors of more coming early in the new year. And among some of those who look to outlast Trump in Washington, there has been a growing willingness to defy him. To be clear, the president still enjoys widespread popularity with the MAGA rank and file, and many GOP lawmakers live in fear of a Trump-backed primary challenge. But arguably, one of Trump’s greatest political superpowers—one that has been evident since his hostile takeover of the GOP in the 2016 campaign—was an ability to demand absolute fealty from Republican lawmakers. That is now eroding. And the first, most meaningful, fissure has been about a dead man.

Trump really wanted to stop hearing about Epstein. He snapped at aides who tried to bring up Epstein when storylines about the disgraced pedophile financier began to percolate during the late summer, and he grew furious at some MAGA supporters who wouldn’t let the matter go. The president himself was never a full-throated Epstein conspiracy theorist, but he repeatedly intimated during last year’s campaign that something was nefarious about the government’s handling of the case. Yet he never understood why the matter—and questions about Epstein’s prison death, which was ruled a suicide—was so meaningful to some of his supporters: It was not a liberal conspiracy theory; it was largely a MAGA one. Trump admitted to a long friendship with Epstein—the two men ran in the same rarefied Manhattan and Palm Beach circles and enjoyed pursuing young women—but, he insisted, he broke off contact with the financier before he ran into legal trouble. (His accounts as to why they had a falling-out have shifted multiple times.)

Read: ‘They’re delusional if they think this is going to go away’

Yet it was some of MAGA’s loudest voices—Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace among them—who defied Trump’s efforts to bury the story. And it turned out that they were the harbingers of an avalanche; Trump got rolled by Republicans in both the House and the Senate last month when they voted for the publication of all of the Epstein materials. His hand forced, Trump authorized their release. But every time his administration has tried to make the Epstein matter go away, it’s only inadvertently turned up the spotlight. Last week’s publication of Epstein materials failed to satisfy lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and that release focused on former President Bill Clinton, making it appear transparently political. Today’s batch—quite the news dump, just before the Christmas holiday—yet again reinforced just how close Trump and Epstein were.

The Epstein question spawned the first widespread Republican rebellion against the president and opened the door for GOP defiance on other issues, including the legality of the Venezuelan boat strikes and tossing away the filibuster. Formerly meek Republicans found their voice to scold Trump for his callous social-media post blaming the filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder. They urged him to focus on health-care costs and affordability in the new year.

The White House, which did not respond to a request for comment, insists that Trump is listening. His aides have begun organizing events on housing and prescription-drug prices. They touted the fact that the nation’s economic growth accelerated to a 4.3 percent annual rate last quarter, blowing past expectations. After months without any domestic travel, Trump went to both Pennsylvania and North Carolina to (at least nominally) discuss affordability. Aides promise that he’ll be on the road often next year, ahead of the November midterm elections. Hill Republicans seem willing to try to tackle health care. Although the chances of getting another sweeping legislative program through Congress may be slim, the West Wing is looking into another batch of executive orders—including rolling back more environmental and business regulations—to goose the economy. And conventional political wisdom has rarely applied to Trump, who still has the time, and power, to pull off another comeback.

But Trump himself displays no sign of a course correction. He has defended tariffs that have raised prices on consumers and previewed plans to ratchet up a deportation plan that polls show voters think is too extreme. He shouted his way through an Oval Office address last week meant to be a reset, seemingly trying to browbeat America into believing that he’s doing a good job. (He also recently rated the economy “A+++++.”)

And he’s eager to show off the designs for the arch that will mark an entrance into Washington and the $400 million ballroom that will be built where the White House’s East Wing once stood. Yesterday, he boasted about a new “Trump class” of naval warships that military experts immediately denounced as unnecessary and expensive. He reveled in receiving a “peace prize” from FIFA, the soccer organization, and in hosting the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. (Next year, he’ll surely insist that they be called the Trump-Kennedy Center Honors.) And he proudly showed off the “Walk of Fame” he constructed on the West Wing colonnade, which included insulting assessments of some former presidents (no word yet on what he wrote about Chester A. Arthur) that even some Fox News hosts panned as a childish desecration of a sacred national space.

Trump’s preoccupations have only reinforced the perception that he’s lost touch (as have the several recent moments in which the 79-year-old president appeared to fall asleep in public). None of this has reassured a Republican Party beginning to eye the midterms with dread. As Trump’s poll numbers continue to dip, more Republicans feel that a permission structure has been created for them to occasionally defy the president’s wishes. And for the first time, some in the GOP are beginning to consider life after Trump. There are deep divides in the MAGA base—many on full display at the Turning Point USA conference this week—but also a willingness by Vice President J. D. Vance and others to take some (quiet) steps toward inheriting Trump’s mantle.

“No Republican had dared even breathing the word 2028 for fear of triggering Trump,” one close outside adviser told me. “But that’s changing. And the quickest way to become a lame duck is to lose your own party.”</div>

            <h2>The Epstein Files Only Get Worse</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/holiday-epstein-purgatory/685435/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This particularly cursed holiday week kicked off in earnest last night when my father turned his iPad in my direction. On its screen was a terribly disturbing post on X containing two images. In the first, Jeffrey Epstein was hugging and kissing a little girl. In the second, that girl was bound and gagged on a bed.

Dad was rightly outraged and disgusted. He asked me if I’d seen the photos in my time going through the Epstein files. I immediately recognized the first image of Epstein and deduced that it had been Photoshopped from a widely distributed photo of Epstein hugging Ghislaine Maxwell. The second image seemed to be an AI rendering. (To add to the confusion, images reportedly do exist of Epstein cuddling children.) I let him know that the imagery was fake, and a distinctly non-yuletidy conversation ensued. Yes, Epstein was a heinous pedophile and convicted sex offender. Also, the internet is awash in fake, traumatizing slop that’s being used to score points in an ongoing information war. Happy holidays!

Early this morning, the Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 documents related to its investigations into Epstein. A previous batch was released late last Friday afternoon, as mandated by Congress, and was notable for its thorough redactions, its overall lack of material related to President Donald Trump, and the fact that it was incomplete. This latest batch contains far more mentions of Trump, leading the DOJ to issue a defensive-sounding, partisan, and frankly unprofessional post on X: “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”

As I looked through the documents myself, I realized that many mentions of Trump in this batch come from news stories or documents referencing publicly available information about the president. For example, a random email in the archive includes a link to a story headlined “Trump: Kushner’s Security Clearance Is Up to Kelly.”

But there are some new, salacious-seeming details. Take, for instance, a 2020 email from an unidentified federal prosecutor alerting an unknown recipient that Trump had taken more trips on Epstein’s plane than was previously realized. There are at least two unvetted forms submitted in 2020 to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center tip line that mention Trump’s name in conjunction with alarming and unproven allegations, including rape and paying for sex.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about these new documents and allegations, and instead referred me to posts on X by the DOJ; Trump has previously denied any wrongdoing and has downplayed his past relationship with Epstein.

Another shocking revelation is a copy of a letter allegedly written by Epstein to Larry Nassar, a former U.S.-gymnastics-team doctor who was convicted of possessing child pornography, among other crimes, and who used his position to sexually abuse hundreds of women and girls. The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein’s death, in 2019, and makes a reference to suicide. “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” the letter, which appears to have been signed by Epstein, reads. “Good luck! We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential.” The letter continues: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.” The existence of a letter sent by Epstein to Nassar had been previously reported by the Associated Press, but the contents had not been; earlier today, the DOJ posted on X that it had concluded that the Nasser letter was fake, which “serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual.”

These details alone are a lot to take in. That they are just a few needles of newsworthy information in a PDF haystack is dizzying. Blearily tabbing through the files at random this morning, I came across screenshots of what appear to be emails between prosecutors in Epstein’s 2008 sex-crimes case, which resulted in Epstein getting a cushy plea deal (almost all of the names in the email are redacted). I can think of no reason that the names of those who afforded him such an arrangement shouldn’t be made public. In one of the emails, from late May of that year, one person mentions an unnamed person, presumably Epstein, spending only 90 days in jail. “Please tell me you are joking,” the other replies. “Maybe we should throw him a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Such emails, although redaction-heavy, are the kind of information that journalists and investigators have longed for—they shed partial light on the government’s leniency in the case. Still, the release is piecemeal and difficult to comb through; as a result, it paints an unclear picture.

As is often the case online, the messy, public release has at times led to more confusion than clarity. On X this morning, I came across a viral post containing a screenshot of one of the FBI tips from the files that alleges that Trump and Epstein raped a woman. “Now we’re starting to see why Trump was hiding the Epstein files, and it probably gets much worse,” the post reads. Digging through the files, I’ve confirmed that the document is real, but the post—which currently has several million views—lacks crucial context. The allegations are not part of a court document or witness testimony; they’re transcribed from a 2020 call to the FBI tip line, and totally unconfirmed.

This is a sterling example of the informational chaos here. A disturbing, salacious tip, the credibility of which is completely unknown, printed on an official FBI form: It’s perfect fodder for screenshots, reposts, and accusations. The “information” looks terrible for Trump, but it’s presented without any burden of proof. That the DOJ would release something so potentially incendiary but redact other information, such as the names of government lawyers, only adds to the confusion.

The Epstein scandal has consumed Washington and dogged Trump’s second term, and the release of these latest files is textbook news dump: a massive tranche of individual image files and PDFs, collected with few discernible organizing details, dropped online just before the Christmas holiday. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Sunday that the partial, phased release is being done in part to protect victims. Although that could be the case, the drip-drop release has the added effect of being frustrating and overwhelming, stringing everyone along during a moment when fewer people are likely to be paying attention.

Ironically, the nature of the release also means that the story will not die. Today’s release has only fanned the flames of the conspiracy. It also fragments an important news story such that it becomes hard to get a good sense of where things stand. In one interpretation, it might feel like the walls are closing in for Trump and the White House, where an avalanche of anecdotal evidence—the infamous 50th-birthday-book release in September, a trove of emails in November that mention Trump and his onetime adviser Steve Bannon, last Friday’s release, today’s—is piling up. But seen another way, this release is also optimally confusing, muddying the waters with as-yet-unverified information that’s being disseminated via individual screenshots on social media, making the whole thing easier to dismiss.

There’s a secondary effect for those of us watching, which is that of being trapped in some kind of Epstein holiday purgatory. Family gatherings and Honey Baked Hams are colliding with the slow-burn proliferation of crime-scene evidence related to an alleged prolific sex trafficker who appears to have been close friends with the current president of the United States. Those following the Epstein saga closely are stuck waiting for the next shoe to drop; those with more normal news-consumption habits or who may wish to ignore the sordid affair may be forced to acknowledge it as nauseating details barge into their life while they scroll, channel surf, or talk with a politics-obsessed uncle at the dinner table.

This would be a small price to pay, if any true accountability were to come from this process. But much of the context of the Epstein files is that they are being released by a DOJ that, as my colleague David A. Graham wrote yesterday, has gone to great lengths to politicize itself in the second Trump administration. As Graham notes, the entire Epstein ordeal is a showcase of “compounding failures” by the federal government, from its slowness to act on tips about Epstein many years ago, to the plea deal in 2008, to this administration’s questioning of Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell and her move to a minimum-security prison this past summer. And then there is what the files continue to confirm: a moral rot in some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world. Combine these things, and the files are a recipe for inspiring potent distrust and resentment.

Those of us paying attention are, for now, stuck—bombarded with enough troubling information and allegations to assume the worst about this conspiracy, but also possessing enough earned cynicism and suspicion to assume that little will change.</div>

            <h2>Companies’ ‘Wrapped’ Features Keep Getting Weirder</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

The holidays are a time for reflection, but lately I’ve been overthinking things: Over the past few weeks, I’ve listened to a playlist of my top songs via Spotify “Wrapped,” revisited my summer-long job hunt on LinkedIn’s Year in Review, and ruminated on my crossword abilities with The New York Times’ Year in Games feature. In 2025, there seem to be more of these data interpolators than ever: The event-planning service Partiful invites users to an After Party, revealing the people they socialized with the most this year. Your Year With ChatGPT lets us see how many em dashes we exchanged with AI. There’s also PlayStation’s Wrap-Up, Goodreads’ Year in Books, and Years in Review for Duolingo, Letterboxd, and Oura. Even Untappd, a social network for beer enthusiasts, has a year-end wrap-up called Recappd.

The wrap-up tradition has been around for a number of years, but what was once a cheeky bit of marketing has now expanded into a full-blown season of its own. In today’s internet landscape, personalization is the coin of the realm: Search results, on-site advertisements, and social feeds are all tailored to users’ precise desires based on their behaviors. During recap season, those behaviors themselves become the product. Data typically reserved for in-house analytics teams are suddenly interesting in and of themselves—and reviewing those data can be fun, until we’re reminded just how much we’re tracked, and just how valuable our data are to companies’ bottom line.

Because the market for year-end-data visualization has become so bloated, and because consumers now practically expect their digital habits to be condensed and repackaged, products and services that really needn’t be “wrapped” are being contorted into the format. For the past few years, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has issued a Metro Rewind, totaling commuters’ top bus and railway stops. The goal, according to a press release, is nothing less than “transforming each person’s transit history into a vivid, shareable snapshot that captures how you move across the region.” No data set is too mundane for this treatment: The cloud-storage service Google One sent out a Year in Review telling users how much of their allotted storage they’ve used up, and reminding them how long they’ve been subscribed.

But the year-end recaps that seem to work best are the ones that give people something they actually want. In the case of Spotify Wrapped, the promotional blitz is productive both for the company collecting the data and for the user. Wrapped is a glorified ad for Spotify’s ability to make money off its users’ data, but it also comes with a host of features that are actually useful. I look forward to Spotify Wrapped because it leaves me with a playlist full of my favorite songs of the year and lets me compare my songs against my friends’. But as more companies scramble to turn wonky user data into something slick and shareable, the utility and the joy get harder to see: Do we really need a readout of the Metro stops that our friends are visiting most frequently?

What it does reveal isn’t always enjoyable, either. I consider each order placed on a food-delivery app to be a personal failing on my part, but Uber Eats’ “YOUBER” attempts to celebrate those late-night moments of laziness and capitulation. At their best, personalized year-end recaps find the fun in data. But the story of a meal—even a memorable one shared with friends—can’t be told in flat numbers. And it’s a good thing that Strava’s Year in Sport is reserved for paying subscribers, since I know I’d bristle when confronted with all of the days I failed to run this year.

Spotify says that “your Wrapped is a reflection of you: unparalleled and unmistakably personal.” But the idea that such limited data can offer that level of access is a convenient fiction. These features can also reflect what users want them to: As recaps have become a yearly expectation, some people have found ways to alter their digital footprints, cherry-picking the kinds of media (books on Goodreads, movies on Letterboxd, music on Spotify) that might reflect refinement and taste when it comes time to share. “Just as the machine tailors itself to us, we try to tailor ourselves to it,” my colleague Nancy Walecki wrote in a 2023 reflection on Spotify Wrapped. Enthusiasts like to debate when exactly Spotify stops tracking user behavior, and which weeks out of the year might not count for the following year’s edition. This year, Spotify tracked listening habits from January to mid-November, which means it’s entirely possible that mid-November through December is unsurveilled time. “Safe months to listen to your guilty pleasures,” a Mashable article once called this indeterminate period.

In 2025, surveillance is no revelation. We choose to surrender our valuable data to certain apps because we accept that the products are worth it. And, in many cases, when those annual recaps arrive, we welcome them. But it helps when companies give us something to make those concessions a little easier to tolerate. Hence the bargain I make with Spotify each year. Still, I relish what little chance I get to evade the watchful eyes of these data collectors. We have another full week before the tracking for next year’s reviews kicks off—and then we’ll do it all over again.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

‘It’s Very Controversial, but I Love Nick Fuentes’

When I rode the escalator into the lobby of the Phoenix Convention Center on Thursday, one of the first things I saw was a two-story-tall picture of Charlie Kirk with his arm reaching out to the sky …

AmericaFest has long been one of the biggest events on the right, but this year, the conference saw a record turnout of roughly 30,000. When I asked attendees why they had decided to come, they invariably told me that they were there “because of Charlie.” Many of the most prominent influencers and politicians in MAGA world spoke at the event, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Donald Trump Jr., and Steve Bannon. Almost all invoked his memory onstage. When Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke of erecting a statue of Kirk in the United States Capitol, the crowd broke out into “Charlie” chants. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton compared Kirk to Jesus.

But during my four days at AmericaFest, I noticed that something else was also casting a shadow over the conference. Everyone had come to unite around Kirk, but they kept fighting about Nick Fuentes.

Take a look. Every story The Atlantic publishes includes art that provides readers with another lens through which they can understand and experience a given subject or idea. Here’s a collection of The Atlantic art department’s favorite images of the year.

            <div id="article-text">Updated with new questions at 3:40 p.m. ET on December 23, 2025.

It’s a short holiday week here for Atlantic Trivia; I’ll be quizzing you Monday and Tuesday, and then we’ll part until the new year.

But note that Anders Celsius developed his centigrade system for measuring temperature on December 25, 1741. The first predicted return of Halley’s Comet was observed precisely 17 years later. The keen mind can still accomplish a lot at Christmas.

In fact, who needs presents (I desperately ask as I realize that my online orders will not arrive before Thursday)? Isn’t knowledge the greatest gift of all?

Find last week’s questions here, and to get Atlantic Trivia in your inbox every day, sign up for The Atlantic Daily.

And by the way, did you know that those beloved Christmas TV specials of the 1960s were not always funded by the studios themselves, but by corporate sponsors? We have Coca-Cola to thank for A Charlie Brown Christmas, and we owe Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to General Electric, which kind of makes sense if you consider Rudolph’s snout an appliance.

Ironically, How the Grinch Stole Christmas was sponsored by an industry group for banks. I’m guessing the employee tasked with confirming brand alignment had already checked out for the year and skipped right over the message at the story’s heart: “Perhaps Christmas doesn’t come from a store.”

Have a happy holiday, and see you in the new year.

How did you do? Come back in the new year for more Atlantic Trivia, or click here for last week’s. And if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that twice a year in the tropics, the sun is positioned ever so briefly exactly overhead? Elsewhere in the world, the sun never reaches true zenith, but in the band around the equator, its semiannual appearance produces the eerie effect of shadowlessness for objects on the ground.

Look up Lāhainā Noon (as it’s called in Hawaiʻi) if you wish to be disconcerted by some apparently levitating traffic cones and parking-lot stanchions. The magic lasts only a jiffy; then you’re stuck with the bummer of merely being in Hawaiʻi.</div>

            <h2>The Phone-Based Retirement Is Here</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/do-your-parents-have-screen-time-problem/685424/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A friend of mine had just traveled across the country to see his family when he texted me, deeply concerned. The chaos of holiday travel is always a drag, but usually, it was offset by getting a break and watching his kids spend quality time with their grandparents. But this year was different, he said: “They were just absorbed in their phones a lot of the time, and distant.” He wasn’t talking about the kids, but the grandparents.

I’ve heard similar anecdotes in recent years—adult children worried about their parents slipping into screen addiction as they age. Stories like this pervade the internet. (One representative thread from the Millennials Subreddit: “Are all of our parents addicted to their phones?”) These accounts are striking in part because they mirror the concerns parents have been expressing for years about their children—that young minds are being influenced and warped by devices designed to seize and capitalize on their attention. Screen-time panics typically position children as being without agency, completely at the mercy of evil tech companies that adults must intervene to defend against. But a version of the problem exists on the opposite side of the age spectrum, too: instead of a phone-based childhood, a phone-based retirement.

Over the past year, I asked people to share their stories with me. “I am constantly begging my mom to put her phone down, every time I see her she is just mindlessly scrolling. I swear her attention span is GONE,” one person wrote. Another described a parent as “playing Candy Crush for hours while the grandkids fight for a spot on her lap to play with her because that’s ‘spending time together.’”

Some described what sounded like an omnipresent sensory assault: “Visiting my folks is very often two TVs blaring in different parts of the house while everyone scrolls their ipads/phones,” one person wrote. Many of the messages were quite blunt: “I’ve had to tell my boomer parents not to be glued to their iPads around our 3yr old.”

Many people messaged me privately to express real concern. Most asked me not to use their full name, as they did not want to speak publicly about their family members. Josh, who lives in Ohio, said his father is consumed by vertical-video content on Instagram and TikTok. “I definitely think it’s more of a coping thing with him,” he said. “He has depression and bad anxiety. Trying to get him to turn to better hobbies.”

Others were concerned about scams. “Worry more about him online than I do my 11 yo,” a man named Conor said. “Every time I go back home I have to take my dad’s iPhone and unsubscribe him from the myriad of scam virus scanning subscription apps he’s been duped into downloading from an ad in some word game or something. Had to turn off his ability to download apps from the App Store as a preventative measure.” One person who wished to remain totally anonymous said their parent had been spending inordinate amounts of time on Instagram and accidentally reposting NSFW videos to their feed and soothing themselves with brain-rot AI-slop content.

These stories aren’t just anecdotal: Older people really are spending more time online, according to various research, and their usage has been moving in that direction for years. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found that people 60 and older “now spend more than half of their daily leisure time, four hours and 16 minutes, in front of screens,” many watching online videos. A lot of this seems to be happening on YouTube: This year, Nielsen reported that adults 65 and up now watch YouTube on their TVs nearly twice as much as they did two years ago. A recent survey of Americans over 50 revealed that “the average respondent spends a collective 22 hours per week in front of some type of screen.” And one 2,000-person survey of adults aged 59 to 77 showed that 40 percent of respondents felt “anxious or uncomfortable without access” to their device.

But usage surveys do not capture the nuance of a person’s relationship with their device. It is easy to retreat to broad stereotypes about older adults—to suggest that they’re illiterate when it comes to social media or confused by new technology, or to see them as dupes for scams. Reality is far more complicated, Ipsit Vahia, the chief of geriatric psychiatry at Mass General Brigham’s McLean Hospital and the director of its Technology and Aging Laboratory, told me.

“There is just a fundamental error in the way we think about older adults, where we classify everyone 65 and over as this one kind of block,” he said. Not only are the elderly not a monolithic group, but as Vahia argues, the older a generation gets, the more diverse that generation is. As he sees it, two 5-year-olds are going to have more in common by default than two 87-year-olds are likely to: The older you get, the more opportunities you have for different experiences, and to develop different habits and perspectives. “Our rule of thumb is that if you’ve met one older adult, well, you’ve met one older adult.”

Many of today’s screen-time concerns are rooted in the coronavirus pandemic, which drove a noticeable uptick in tech adoption among seniors. “When the alternative is isolation, then the technology becomes a very powerful, positive force,” Vahia said. In many cases, he notes, Zoom was the on-ramp. In the early days of the pandemic, families started having Zoom reunions, and churches began Zoom services. The technology became useful for telehealth appointments. All of this helped some older people become more confident using these technologies.

The thing to remember is that not all screen use is equal, especially among older people. Some research suggests that spending time on devices may be linked to better cognitive function for people over 50. Word games, information sleuthing, instructional videos, and even just chatting with friends can provide positive stimuli. Vahia suggests that online habits that might be concerning for young or middle-aged people ought to be considered differently for older generations. “High technology use in teenagers and adolescents is often associated with worse mental health and is a predictor of sort of more isolation and loneliness, even depression,” he told me. “Whereas in older adults, engaging in technology seems to be protecting them from isolation and loneliness.”

And yet many of the technology-use examples Vahia offered seemed somewhat idealized. Epic Words With Friends sessions or productive Wikipedia binges clearly fall in the less-problematic camp. But many of the people I’d heard from described device spirals that seemed far more depressing. One person who identified herself as a nurse working in the United Kingdom, and who asked not to be identified because she was not authorized to speak about patients, told me in a direct message that in her inpatient ward, many of her older patients are trapped in a cycle of “excessive scrolling,” where “the amount of slop they consume on phones and iPads is unreal!”

“Some of it is fairly benign,” she said. “And sometimes it’s actually been pretty funny, like when folks end up in an autoplay cul-de-sac of Chinese language videos.” But the negative effects “are bleeding through more,” she said. She pointed to virulent anti-immigration content, “and the conspiracy thinking and medical distrust, too.” Spend enough time on Facebook or Instagram and you can probably spot this dynamic in action. It looks like confused comments on AI-slop images from people who don’t appear to recognize that what they’re seeing is fake. It looks like hyperpartisan pages feeding generated images depicting minorities committing crimes reshared by concerned users who appear to be getting more fearful, paranoid, or polarized. It looks like scams from fake accounts pretending to be a bank or loan provider or a lonely man with some 30 female AI chatbot companions.

From the December 2025 issue: The age of anti-social media is here

Even here, Vahia urged against moral panic: When I brought up the idea of older people soft-brain scrolling AI slop on Facebook all day, he suggested a meaningful difference between active and passive consumption. Who’s to say that every old person is necessarily being fooled by slop? Maybe they’re making fun of it together or trying to figure out what’s real and what isn’t. “Slop as giving people a common thing to talk about that might not have too many common things to talk about—now that’s a little more nuanced, isn’t it?” he said.

Maybe so. There’s certainly a bit of projection happening. The anxieties I heard from people who reached out to me—the anxiety I myself have felt—seem rooted in our own tortured relationships with our devices. Many of us are constantly concerned about what we’re consuming, how much we’re scrolling, and the subtle ways we’re all being pushed, prodded, and manipulated online. And we map our individual worries onto others, fair or not.

But Shrimp Jesus and synthetic videos of ICE agents arresting people are meant to confuse or enrage users, along with all the other clickbait clogging social platforms. True, we shouldn’t assume that older people are dupes, but this is a system run by tech giants that reward engagement, not quality: For people with more free time than they know what to do with, who may already be struggling with isolation or other mental-health issues, the glowing screen may be an irresistible temptation.

When I asked Vahia about the holiday elder-scrolling phenomenon that I’d heard so much about, he encouraged me to look at it from a different perspective. “Yes, you observe it when you meet them during the holidays,” he said. “But the problem is you’re not there the rest of the time. Their phones are a big part of their lives, for better or worse, and your arrival is actually the disruption.”

It’s worth considering, he argues, what the phone is doing when nobody is around. Is it preventing a loved one from sinking into depression? Is it giving them a tether to the world around them? Are they happier with the world in their pocket or on their tablet than they might be without it? Algorithms complicate human agency, but some people may want to spend their golden years on their phone consuming an endless scroll of entertainment. Who’s to judge?

This is a muddled mess. The same tools that are keeping some people connected to reality are blurring the lines of what is real for others. But rather than rush to judgment, younger people should use their concern to open up a conversation—to put down the phones and talk.</div>

            <h2>America’s Schools Are Less Divided Than You Think</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2025/12/willing-warriors-mark-hlavacik-book-review/685415/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August of 2022, a resident of Denton, Texas, appeared before his school board to demand the removal of a salacious library book. He read aloud passages from the novel describing detailed sexual acts. But the book he was reading from, Love Lies Beneath, wasn’t actually available in the school district’s libraries. He had confused the sexy psychological thriller with Lies Beneath, a young-adult novel about mermaids.

At the time, Mark Hlavacik was a professor at the local university in Denton. In his new book, Willing Warriors, Hlavacik argues that the episode epitomizes how culture wars have distorted the politics of education in the United States. Since at least the 1925 Scopes “monkey trial,” in which a Tennessee high-school teacher was accused of violating a law that prohibited the teaching of evolution, Americans have argued about school curricula. But from the 1980s until the end of the Obama years, a bipartisan focus on achievement, as measured by standardized-test scores, was largely “keeping the lid” on these educational culture wars, Hlavacik writes. The lid came off with the 2015 repeal of the No Child Left Behind Act, which had rated and rewarded schools based on those scores. Now, he concludes, it’s culture wars all the way down.

Instead of trying to improve students’ reading and math skills, Hlavacik writes, schools have become theaters of political drama and control. Each side tries to impose its dogmas upon the classroom, following what he classifies as two basic scripts: exposé and innovation. First, someone, like the objecting citizen in Denton, warns that a dangerous force is corrupting the schools. Then they put forth a plan to transform education, promising to substitute their own wisdom for the ignorance of the crowd.

Ironically, Hlavacik’s book traffics in the same dynamic he decries: It’s an exposé of the many ways that the exposé script warps education. And I fear that he, too, might have distorted the actual dangers facing our schools. American teachers, for the most part, are much more concerned with student learning and behavior than they are with complaints from angry parents or others in their community about divisive issues, which—as my own research shows—rarely enter our classrooms. Although perhaps, in fact, they should, because every classroom culture battle reflects a real division in our society. Schools shouldn’t be insulated spaces that shield their students from debate; they should prepare young people to communicate with those who might disagree with them.

Read: Tell students the truth about American history

In a 2024 American Historical Association survey of more than 3,000 middle- and high-school history teachers in nine different states, just 2 percent said they “frequently” faced “objections or criticisms” about their instruction, and 45 percent said they had never received an objection. This is not overwhelming evidence that schools are free from political interference: English teachers have been the target of public attacks in recent years for teaching certain controversial novels, and more than two-thirds of high-school principals in a 2022 survey reported “substantial political conflict” with parents and community members. And the AHA poll was taken before Donald Trump regained the White House and issued an executive order barring “radical, anti-American ideologies” from schools.

But the survey—which its authors call the most comprehensive study of history instruction in the past 50 years—underscores a more immediate concern: not enough instructional time with students and not enough professional training for teachers. You might imagine that the repeal of No Child Left Behind freed teachers from onerous bureaucratic constraints. But that’s not what they report, because states and school districts continue to lard them with additional curriculum requirements. In Wyoming, for example, teachers must address the history of cowboys and cowgirls; in Louisiana, they are charged with presenting Francophone heritage. Throw in whatever reform du jour their districts have embraced—social and emotional learning, personalized instruction, and so on—and teachers have less and less time for each topic they need to cover. They’re generally not worried about losing their jobs to an angry mob of anti-woke parents; they’re worried about doing their jobs well and doing right by their students.

Yet Hlavacik is also right, over the long term, about the many ways that culture wars inflame—and distort—educational politics. He starts his story in the 1970s, with the fracas over Man: A Course of Study. The brainchild of Jerome Bruner, an eminent cognitive psychologist, this curriculum aimed to introduce children to the essential questions of life: what makes us human, and how we can become more so. One of its units focused on the Netsilik, an Inuit nation in the Canadian Arctic that was once reported to have practiced senicide (the killing or abandonment of the elderly). Films that accompanied the curriculum also showed the Netsilik disemboweling a seal and carving up a caribou.

These details caught the attention of several right-wing journalists and eventually a GOP congressman, who claimed that the course was anti-Christian and pro-Communist. That was absurd. But the implementation of Man: A Course of Study was also flawed. For one, its funder, the National Science Foundation, buried several negative reports that the course received from a peer review. Nothing about this story was black-and-white. But culture wars tend to reduce every conflict to a simple morality play, as Hlavacik repeatedly shows.

Read: When America persecutes its teachers

Two decades later, another national school-curriculum drama played out, this time over history. As Hlavacik writes, in 1994, a team that included academic historians and secondary-school history teachers released a proposed set of standards that included scholarship about long-neglected groups in American history, especially Black people and women. According to the talk-show impresario Rush Limbaugh, they distorted history by ignoring or denigrating significant figures such as the Founding Fathers. No federal agency ever adopted the standards, which were eventually rejected in the Senate.

Likewise, when Barack Obama’s administration proposed a “Common Core” curriculum to replace the different state standards promulgated under No Child Left Behind, political commentators such as Glenn Beck accused educators and testing companies that had come out in support of the plan of conspiring with the White House to impose mind control upon America. To some of its critics, Common Core was a malicious plot masquerading as an innovation.

And as states started to abandon Common Core, school controversies began to focus less on standards and achievement than on competing understandings of America itself. That’s the focus of Hlavacik’s final chapter, about “The 1619 Project,” which triggered one of the most polarizing culture wars in contemporary American education. Appearing first as a series of articles in The New York Times Magazine, and then adapted into history curricula around the country, “The 1619 Project” sought to revise readers’ understanding of the nation’s history by rooting it in slavery rather than in founding principles such as equality and freedom. In response, some on the right charged that the Times and its allies in academia were negatively misrepresenting American history. (The project was also controversial among some academic historians, who disputed a number of its claims.)

As Hlavacik demonstrates, “The 1619 Project” itself participated in the rhetoric of exposé: depicting America as a fount of oppression rather than liberty, it also indicted schools for neglecting a full accounting of discomfiting chapters of our past. It is true, as the “1619 Project” contributor Nikita Stewart noted, that some popular history textbooks have given short shrift to slavery. But most history teachers in the U.S. no longer rely upon a textbook for daily instruction. They draw on a wide range of other sources, and they certainly address topics like slavery. A USA Today report found, too, that across the country, teachers are discussing difficult subject matter with nuance and presenting varied perspectives on the country’s history. Some teachers’ lessons might lack sophistication or depth, but the idea that schools are neglecting or ignoring slavery is probably overstated.

So, too, is the notion that our schools are racked by culture wars. Most schools, according to the AHA survey, present American history as a slow but steady march toward fulfilling our founding ideals. As the authors of that report found, history teachers are generally committed “to teaching both inspirational and unsettling histories.” Perhaps Trump’s actions—combined with state laws barring “divisive” concepts from the classroom—will bring an end to that, forcing teachers to avoid or downplay the ugly parts of our past. But for now, a rough consensus seems to hold sway. Culture warriors routinely distract people from the ideas and practices that Americans share in most classrooms around the country. We live in a deeply polarized society, so it’s hardly a surprise that schools—like other institutions—have become targets of political division and controversy. When you drill down into the schools themselves, however, you are likely to find more agreement than dissent.

In an earlier book, Hlavacik decried the Obama-era consensus on testing and accountability, which he argued exaggerated the deficiencies of American education and blamed schools and teachers for them. As his new volume shows, that bipartisan accord on boosting test scores is largely gone—at a time when we need it more than ever, given recent reports about low academic achievement. But this moment also offers an opportunity to encourage democratic deliberation in schools. Despite the recent boom in homeschooling—and the rapid growth of voucher systems, which provide public dollars for private schools—most Americans continue to patronize their local public schools. These battered but venerable institutions still represent our most promising vehicle for teaching young people how to communicate across the issues that divide us. Instructors can learn from the example of Idaho English teacher Kam Walters, who assigned the report put out by Trump’s 1776 Commission in addition to “The 1619 Project” and told students to “weigh the arguments” in each. I’d like to suggest another experiment: pairing students with kids in other parts of the country to engage in debate and discussion about controversial issues. A school in deep-blue New York City, for example, might connect high schoolers via Zoom with students in bright-red rural Alabama. One week, they might discuss reproductive rights; the next week, gun control.

Read: America is sliding toward illiteracy

Hlavacik might reply that I’m envisioning my own innovation here, which will inevitably spawn some kind of exposé. A biased or misinformed teacher will say the wrong thing, a student will videotape them, the tape will go viral, and the outrage machine will kick into gear. But that is a risk we need to take. If we want to preserve American democracy, we must teach the art of argument and compromise. The biggest barrier to educating informed critical thinkers isn’t the culture wars. It’s our fear of engaging in them.

You might be onto something; replace the spaces with emojis.

Swift allows emojis as valid var, const and func names.  And a few weeks ago there was a Slashdot (I think) story about AI &quot;written&quot; code that had been pasted in to a programme.  The return codes were emojis - sad face for error etc.

Ok, plan B.  If you&#39;re making a language that accepts emojis, it must ONLY accept emojis and classis operands.  No text.  Have kind kiddies. Let me know when you manage &#39;hello world&#39; while the rest of us do something - anything - vaguely more useful.

It&#39;s a privacy and surveillance nightmare people have absolutely no idea about, and it&#39;s already here.

It would be nice if data would be deleted before it left the LPR, if it was considered irrelevent, or perhaps a series of encryption keys used so one body which requires judges to &quot;turn their keys&quot; to allow access be used, while LPR output fitting another criteria of vehicles which are not permitted on the road would be allowed  to be accessed with just the LEOs&#39; keys.  In any case, all data is tagged with an expiration date, where if there isn&#39;t an explicit legal hold, it gets flushed, on an encryption key

For those not in the know, Soviet -stans are somewhat unique in that they came in a region of islamic parts of Silk Road that were utterly primitive when Soviets rolled in. So primitive that they still had the early farming period style division between peoples. They had fairly modern islamic elite town dwellers, rural farmers and finally primitive nomads. Three peoples that didn&#39;t really meet outside raids/enslavement/murder in spite of living next to one another. Three life styles locked in constant existential conflict with two others.

So when Soviets arrived, these peoples fought each other in blood feuds going back millenia all the time. It was a stereotypical hell hole of primitive savagery.

So Soviets tried to civilize these people by giving them an idea of Communist man and a Communist state. It worked, more or less. Nomads were defined as &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; by Soviets and what they made into their nation is hilarious in that it&#39;s main two cities are mainly populated by other peoples because... well primitive nomads. They don&#39;t do the whole &quot;city living&quot; thing. They raid cities.

But Uzbeks are by far the best adapted ones. They were the agriculturalists in an incredibly fertile Ferghana valley. But to survive between constantly marauding and slaving nomads running around the edges of their valley and islamic township elites raping and enslaving from the other side, they had to create a hilariously insular and brutal culture.

They have a rather unique way of dealing with dissent in that they are to my knowledge the only people outside Africa who are known to have boiled people alive/drowned people in scalding water (reports differ on specifics) for political disagreements this century. This is not a too unusual thing in the Black Magic Belt of Africa where doing fucked up shit to people is a norm, but quite rare in Africa outside of it and unheard of outside Africa. Except Uzbekistan.

So yeah, monitoring license plates is not really relevant or interesting in comparison.

Turkmen were the islamic elites for those wondering, and they have their own -stan too. Led by a proper Caliph at this point in all but name, as an Islamic nation should be. That man makes Kim family look like paragons of liberalism and democracy. Fourth and final -stan being by far the largest, and something of an experiment in integrating everyone into a Russian society, which is why it&#39;s fundamentally two states in one and during early USSR was a part of Russian Federation. But it never really integrated. Its north is basically a state for Central Asian Russians, whereas south has a mix of all three original groups separated by a desert from the north.

To give you an idea of just how authoritarian post-Soviet -stans are, the most metropolitan, most Europeanized one with significant Russian population in the north? When its first president for life died, they renamed the capital after him. And that is indeed by far the most liberal of them.

P.S. It&#39;s worth noting that Turkmenistan&#39;s Berdimuhamedow is a living meme for this unironic publicity stunts, and a hilariously entertaining man to follow. Between having his government all do group aerobics to rebuilding his capital in white only because that&#39;s his lucky color, to doing rap songs with his grandson to thundering applause of entire theaters that would make Stalin himself blush, all of his horse related antics and his current push to become a &quot;spiritual leader of the nation&quot; he&#39;s an amazing source of laughs if you&#39;re a Westerner. I really recommend &quot;chronicles of Turkmenistan&quot;, they have an amazing youtube channel where they just collect clips from Turkmenistan&#39;s national TV and cut them with hilarious music into short videos.

The premise of this article makes no sense at all.  Why would Uzbekistan need LPR cameras to track citizens when everyone is already carrying personal tracking devices in the form of smartphones?  And unlike an LPR camera that only records when your vehicle is on the road, a smartphone reveals your personal location.  Why even bother to query LPR camera records when the police can just ping the local cell phone provider and learn exactly where you are and where you have been for several months?

I see this same bizarre doublethink in my own city, where critics of LPR cameras decry their deployment while simultaneously recommending that everyone should be riding mass transit in the first place, where all passengers are placed under constant video and audio surveillance.

If you truly hate government surveillance, why do you tolerate it in mass transit?  Read a little about the capabilities of the systems installed and maintained by March Networks in mass transit systems.  LPR cameras are a joke compared to what our government leaders subject us to when we hop on a bus or a subway.

You can spend a million dollars and years of your time to surface new facts previously unknown to humanity and then turn around and disclose them in your own book.

Someone else can read your book and disclose the same facts to the world for free or in their own book.  This really sucks for the person who spent all that time and effort and it certainly isn&#39;t fair.  It also has absolutely nothing to do with copyright law.

You can make the case on the front end about illegal copying of fixed works for training..

First, you cannot copyright facts.  Compiling and publishing a list of current US Senators by state doesn&#39;t prevent anyone else from publishing the same information.Second, if you have some unknown information you wish to keep secret then don&#39;t publish it.  Trade secrets fall into this category.Third, the first person to discover a fact doesn&#39;t own it.  Publishing the first book about the interaction of electricity and magnetism doesn&#39;t mean you can prevent other people from talking abo

The problem is that they&#39;re doing it wrong, they should have opted out of the class, and filed a notice of appeal with regards to the judge&#39;s findings on the law, rather than try to relitigate what the law is, when that is going to be barred by collateral estoppel / res judicata.

&quot;Transformative&quot; as in &quot;can copy look & feel and occasionally regurgitate training data&quot;? That kind of &quot;transformative&quot;?

accusing the AI firms of training models on pirated copies of their books.

So if the AI co&#39;s scanned purchased books they would be fine with it?

Sorry, but that is a really dumb comment.

This unfettered commercial (!) criminal copyright infringement has to stop.

There are a few actually useful use cases for AI on this space. For instance, allowing non-security users to find relevant information via natural language prompts. Or to display and predict trends over events. I sure would not trust AI to deploy fixes - although some agents can do that within the infrastructure space. But if AI can replace a worker, I pray for the day it replace the suits upstairs.

Not true. For attackers, AI is quite helpful and probably can lift script-kiddy level attackers up to lower mid-range or so. It can also help attackers scale their operations by taking over negotiations with their victims. The thing is, attackers do not need reliability. If they have the LLM write 20 attack programs and only one works, that is entirely fine. And if that one is insecure, so what? After then target has been compromised, a root-kit gets installed and that one will not be LLM crap code. Or if a

The Supreme Court dealt a rare and remarkable defeat to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, blocking his deployment of the National Guard to assist immigration agents in Chicago. By a 6–3 vote, the court held that Trump’s federalization of the Guard was likely unlawful, with the majority severely restricting the president’s broader authority to deploy troops for domestic law enforcement. The decision constitutes a significant setback for the administration’s efforts to flood blue cities with National Guard members; it also arguably marks Trump’s biggest Supreme Court defeat since his return to office, with major implications for other aspects of his agenda that go beyond the conservative legal movement’s long-standing priorities.

Tuesday’s ruling in Trump v. Illinois caps off, for now, a clash between federal and state authority with the potential to set off a genuine constitutional crisis. It began in October, when Trump deployed members of the Illinois and Texas National Guards to Chicago to help out with Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration enforcement initiative. The president claimed that both residents and local law enforcement were obstructing the operation, necessitating federalization of the Guard. He ordered Guard members to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection as they engaged in a campaign of brutality and terror against Latino communities. Chicago and Illinois both sued, and a federal judge ruled that Trump’s use of the Guard was probably unlawful. An appeals court agreed, prompting the Justice Department to seek relief from SCOTUS.

The parties’ dispute centered on a federal statute that lets the president deploy the Guard when he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” Chicago asserted that, as a factual matter, Trump could still execute the law; the Justice Department claimed he could not. But after a few weeks of silence, the justices declined to resolve this fact-bound question; instead, they sought additional briefing on a different issue: the meaning of “regular forces.” The DOJ thought the phrase meant federal law enforcement, like ICE and CBP, and Chicago acquiesced to that reading at SCOTUS. But the justices seemed unsure in light of an amicus brief filed by Georgetown Law professor Marty Lederman that argued it meant the military, not police.

On Tuesday, the court formally sided with Lederman, ruling sharply against the Trump administration. It concluded that “regular forces,” as used in the statute, “likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military.” And, of course, Trump had not tried to quell the alleged crisis in Chicago with the military; instead, he went straight to the National Guard. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined with the three liberals to rule against him on that basis. That lopsided outcome is extraordinary on its own.

But Roberts and Barrett then joined with the liberals to go even further. This 5–4 majority held that the relevant statute applies “only where the military could legally execute the laws.” And “such circumstances,” they noted, are “exceptional,” because the president is broadly forbidden from deploying the military for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. There are a few narrow exceptions—namely, the Insurrection Act, which applies only during an insurrection, invasion, or complete breakdown of civilian law enforcement. But outside those extreme scenarios—which no party has yet argued are present in Chicago—the military may not “execute the laws” of the United States. And that, the majority explained, means the National Guard may not “execute the laws in Illinois,” either.

Kavanaugh refused to embrace this broader holding, warning that it would unduly limit the president’s control over the armed forces during “future crises.” He insisted that the president must have more discretion to deploy the Guard when he is practically unable to send in the military. Kavanaugh’s position would carve a pretty glaring loophole into the majority’s holding: It would allow the president to simply announce that he cannot call in the “regular forces” for some practical reason, then summon the National Guard instead.

That workaround would neuter the majority’s broader message, which seems to be that the president can’t make up some reason why he needs the military, then federalize Guard members because it’s more convenient. By forcing the president to call on the military as a first resort for domestic law enforcement—then reminding him that he can very rarely do so lawfully—the majority sharply restricted his use of any troops in American streets. It is unclear if Kavanaugh agrees with this bottom line. (In a footnote, the justice also appeared to walk back his notorious September opinion insisting that immigration agents may engage in racial profiling, which greenlit so-called Kavanaugh stops; he wrote on Tuesday that, actually, officers “must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity.”)

Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, is most notable for its total lack of self-awareness. Alito complained that the majority decided the case with “scant briefing and no oral argument,” when he himself has joined innumerable decisions in favor of Trump that were decided the exact same way. He also suggested that his colleagues imperiled the lives of immigration agents, writing: “Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted.” Yet courts have consistently found that the Trump administration has exaggerated or fabricated threats to these officers; it is, in fact, the officers themselves who have engaged in the most disturbing acts of violence. (Justice Neil Gorsuch’s brief dissent objected to the rapid resolution of such “fraught” questions on a “highly compressed schedule”—though he, too, has regularly joined shadow docket orders that resolved equally weighty questions in Trump’s favor.)

Why, after handing so many victories to the Trump administration over the last year, did the court draw the line here? There are two obvious answers. First, most of the prior cases involved legal issues long settled within the conservative legal movement. Roberts, Barrett, and Kavanaugh have spent their whole careers arguing for the president’s power to fire executive officials. But the Federalist Society has not reached a consensus on the president’s authority to send troops into American cities; to the contrary, its emphasis on federalism might seem to counsel against this sweeping claim of power. Trump’s agenda and the Supreme Court’s priorities may be starting to diverge, with the president pushing some conservative justices far out of their comfort zones and into uncharted territory. These are the cases where the center of the court may be inclined to draw a line.

Second, the National Guard cases have, in the lower courts, devolved into a furious dispute over the facts. The Trump administration keeps getting caught lying about the alleged violence against ICE, leading some judges to argue that he should lose because he is, as a matter of demonstrable reality, able to “execute the laws” without help from the armed forces. By adopting Lederman’s reading, the Supreme Court sidestepped this debate, ruling against Trump without having to call him a liar. The justices clearly did not want to get sucked into this increasingly acerbic and inherently political discourse.

Still, this conflict is far from over. One irony of the court’s decision is that it gives Trump a reason to go nuclear and invoke the Insurrection Act, which really does allow him to send in the military for domestic law enforcement. That law only applies during insurrection, rebellion, or a complete breakdown of state police, none of which is present in Chicago or anywhere else in the U.S. Tuesday’s ruling—with its marked skepticism toward Trump’s deployment of troops at home—suggests that the majority would not approve an invocation of the act on this record. But as Kavanaugh flagged in an ominous footnote, the matter remains unresolved. So that battle looms in the distance. Right now, though, it is just a relief to know that there is still a limit to SCOTUS’ indulgence of this administration’s abuses of power.

The good news about President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new “Trump-class battleship,” based on his own vision of what a modern war vessel should look like, is that it will almost certainly never be built.

The bad news is that, over the next few years, the Navy will spend hundreds of millions of dollars—maybe even a few billion—pretending that it’s working on the project.

Nobody in the Navy has asked for a new battleship of this sort—a behemoth weighing three times as much as the vessel it replaces (which itself is a very heavy ship), staffed by twice as many personnel (recruited from where?), and hoisting every type of weapon imaginable, including nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which, to the relief of every Navy commander, no U.S. surface vessel has carried since the end of the Cold War.

Quite apart from the megalomania of a president naming a warship after himself, the project contradicts a growing consensus among naval analysts for building and dispersing a larger number of smaller, less vulnerable ships. Given that the Chinese navy now has more ships than the U.S. Navy (370 vs. 294) and, more important, hundreds of anti-ship ballistic missiles, which can strike our ships from 900 miles away, the Trump-class battleship is simply wrongheaded for the modern era: It would heighten the U.S. Navy’s already-stressed vulnerabilities at sea.

In a news conference at Mar-a-Lago where the project was announced, Trump—standing next to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio—said he would push the Navy to build the first of the new ships in two-and-a-half years, i.e., before his term is up. (He envisions building 20 to 25 of the ships in all.)

Several retired Navy officers and weapons analysts (including two that I interviewed, who requested anonymity in order to avoid retribution) see this as a pipe dream. The newest Burke-class destroyer ships take about five years to build—and they are much smaller and based on existing designs. To design, construct, weaponize, and deploy a much larger ship based on an entirely new concept would likely take a decade.

The retired officer and naval analyst estimate the first of these ships would likely cost about $10 billion, four times that of the newest Burke destroyer—and that’s not counting the cost of the weapons onboard.

Those weapons are another problem. According to Trump and to subsequent information released by the Navy, much of it compiled by the private research group GlobalSecurity.org, the new ship would carry a lot of new, as-yet-unproven types of armaments, including hypersonic missiles, laser weapons, and an as-yet-undecided power source. Testing all these new weapons, and then integrating them all on one platform, is a very complex task.

The retired admiral told me that the Navy’s most successful project in recent decades is the Aegis-class cruiser. Started in the late 1970s, it works well, and was efficiently built, because it put together existing elements—the Navy’s best missiles, fire-control system, and air defenses—all already-proven. The only new element was an air-defense radar.

By contrast, the much newer Zumwalt-class destroyer, contracted in 2002, tried to integrate lots of new technologies, and it was a disaster. The Navy had planned to build 32 of those ships, but, owing to various delays and cost overruns, ended up building just three.

The same is likely to happen with the Trump-class battleships, if any ever get built at all.

One other problem: The United States just doesn’t have the shipbuilding capacity for this project. The retired admiral and the naval analyst told me the shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, is the only one capable of building a boat this big. Yet it is also where the next aircraft carrier is being built. Which vessel will get priority? There is neither the space nor the workforce to build both.

Finally, it is unclear just what this ship is supposed to do. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said at Mar-a-Lago that the USS Defiant—the name of the first Trump-class ship—“will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.”

But what if it has to fight in a war? Ships mobilize as part of a battle group. Will the USS Defiant help protect the aircraft carrier, along with the various frigates, cruisers, and destroyers? Will it assist the aircraft carrier in projecting power against the enemy? Will it be the “flagship”—the lead vessel—in its own group? These aren’t small questions. The answers will shape the training of the ship’s crews and even, to some degree, its design.

The announcement that the ship will also carry nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles came as a particular surprise. No U.S. surface vessel has carried nukes since the end of the Cold War. President George H.W. Bush ordered them removed back in 1991—and not just for dovish reasons. Not only had the nukes made those ships a more tempting target, they were more trouble than they were worth, requiring specially trained crews and special security procedures. Those ships were also barred from entering the waters and ports of many U.S. allies. I was a defense reporter when Bush made this decision. Every Navy officer I knew heaved a huge sigh of relief. I doubt many of today’s officers want to return to the old era.

Trump has mulled none of this. He first raised the subject back on Sept. 30, in his address before hundreds of generals and admirals at Quantico, Virginia. In the middle of a rambling speech, touching on dozens of topics, he said:

I think we should maybe start thinking about battleships, by the way. … I used to watch Victory at Sea [a documentary about World War II naval battles]. I love Victory at Sea. I look at these admirals, it’s got to be your all-time fave, in black and white. When I look at those ships … man, nothing was going to stop. … They were 20 deep, and they were in a straight line, and there was nothing going to stop them. … They don’t make [ships] that way anymore, but … I’m sort of open to it.

In other words, even aside from its name, the Trump-class battleship is all about Trump—his fantasy-fed nostalgia, feeding his notion that, as the smartest man in the room on any and all subjects, he has the slightest idea how any of this works.

He also likes the looks of this ship, claiming that he was involved in its design. “I’m a very aesthetic person,” he said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference. He has always been impressed by looks; recall his tendency, especially in his first term, to pick Cabinet secretaries because they looked straight out of “central casting.” To him, everything is a show.

Back in his first term, Trump asked the top Navy admirals to come to the White House to talk about ships. A friend of one of those officers, now also a retired admiral, recalls being told that Trump put up pictures of various U.S. ships, criticizing them all as ugly. Then he put up a picture of, the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.

“Now there’s a good-looking ship!” Trump exclaimed.

One of the admirals replied that it might look good, but it wouldn’t last five minutes in a battle at sea. And in fact, the Ukrainian navy sank the Moskva in April 2022, just weeks after the start of that war.

The Trump-class USS Defiant might be good-looking, if it ever sees life on a shipyard. But if it steams into battle, it might meet the same fate as the Moskva.

In something of a Christmas miracle, the MAGA coalition may finally be starting to break down.

The Heritage Foundation, which published the Project 2025 blueprint for this Trump term, just saw more than a dozen staff members defect for former Vice President Mike Pence’s Advancing American Freedom think tank; turncoats include the former leaders of Heritage’s data, economics, and legal teams. Among prominent MAGA leaders—mostly elected officials, people who want to be elected officials, and podcasters—there is a growing divide over what one might assume should be an easily answered question: Should they welcome Nazis, avowed white supremacists, and unrepentant racists hurling slurs into the movement?

This is apparently quite the conundrum. It’s also telling that the cleavage is coming now. After all, the movement Donald Trump built has long welcomed bigots and racists; Trump himself dined with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and enthusiastic antisemite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, although he later claimed to not know who Fuentes was. The people who have gotten into bed with the president, whether they’re D.C. think tank staffers or Jan. 6 hooligans, realized who they were cozying up with.

That some are starting to object and defect suggests that two things are happening at once. The first is that MAGA bigotry has gotten significantly broader, expanding beyond the groups the broader right believes are acceptable to malign (women, Black people, immigrants, Muslims) and coming for groups of which prominent MAGA leaders are a part (Jews, Indians, anyone whose ancestors didn’t come over on the Mayflower). The second is that Trump himself is fading: He’s elderly and showing the typical signs of fatigue and cognitive decline. This is creating something of a vacuum in leadership. Vice President J.D. Vance is the clear MAGA heir apparent (or at least believes himself to be). But he won’t take the throne unchallenged. Some of these contenders want to sit in the Oval Office, and there can be only one butt in the chair behind the Resolute Desk. Others want a different kind of Republican Party: Some strive to turn away from Trumpian populism and toward a tax-cutting pro-business agenda; others aim for a return to the politics of conservative Christianity, with a refocus on restricting abortion and LGBTQ+ rights; a few really may object to MAGA’s blood-and-soil nationalist turn. But the coalition is currently fracturing for one reason: The leader is weak, and a successor is being chosen.

The growing objections to MAGA racism can feel pretty rich coming from people who seemed just fine with many kinds of racism up until now. But it’s also true that MAGA racism has, like the famous “First they came for” poem, proved itself insatiable. Vance has been among the leading voices for the idea that there is a category of “heritage Americans,” a very-online term for people whose family ancestry supposedly gives them more of a claim to legitimate Americanness than anyone else: naturalized citizens, children of immigrants, someone whose grandparents immigrated after World War II. If your ancestors came over anytime after 1789, you are not a “Grade A” American, as one chart puts it. “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” Vance has said—marking those who chose to become American as having a less legitimate right to Americanness than those who fought to break up the country.

This turn has alarmed many conservatives who, like most Americans, are not purely descended from Pilgrims. The elevation of unapologetically antisemitic rhetoric and the growing hatred of Jews among Gen Z conservatives seem to have also spooked some MAGA loyalists. A recent Manhattan Institute focus group of Gen Z conservatives found them praising Adolf Hitler as a “great leader” and understanding “where he was coming from as far as wanting to improve the national state of Germany.” One young man who also said that Jews are a “force for evil” explained: “I’m very pro–strong executive, –strong leader, –strongman. I support national sovereignty, and Hitler was a nationalist. He was like, ‘We have to take Germany back for Germans.’ And I feel like we should do that in America.” A leaked chat among Young Republican leaders showed them joking about the Holocaust, calling Black people monkeys, and saying, “I love Hitler.” Young voters generally hold more antisemitic views than older ones, and young conservatives are, on average, the most antisemitic of all. This may be because young people are getting much of their political news from outrage-amplifying social media, as well as from “influencers” with popular podcasts, TikTok accounts, and YouTube and Discord channels, and many right-wing influencers have seen that racism, sexism, and antisemitism drive traffic—which in turn drives fans to be even more bigoted and reactionary. Candace Owens recently went on an extended antisemitic tirade, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Fuentes have also entertained antisemitic conspiracy theories or flat-out blamed the Jews for various problems. And the Trump administration is putting people with long records of antisemitism into top positions.

This seems to be an inflection point even for some notorious bigots and people who didn’t mind when the president called Somalis “garbage” and compared immigrants with insects. Laura Loomer is one of the country’s most notorious Muslim-haters (she has called Islam a “cancer” and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to hold political office) and acted as if getting banned from Twitter for hate speech was as bad as being sent to the gulags. But now she is suddenly in favor of gatekeeping, enforcing basic standards, and “moral clarity.” Former presidential contender and current candidate for governor of Ohio Vivek Ramaswamy, who during his 2024 campaign claimed that “our diversity is not our strength,” compared prominent Black progressives with the Ku Klux Klan and asserted that he had never seen or met “the boogeyman white supremacist” in America—“Maybe I’ll meet a unicorn sooner,” he added, “and maybe those exist too”—also seems to have changed his tune. “If you believe that Hitler was pretty fucking cool, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement,” Ramaswamy recently said. “If you call Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States of America, a ‘j—t,’ you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.”

J.D. Vance, whose Indian American wife Usha has been called racial slurs by right-wing racists, said that people who target her specifically can “eat shit” but that otherwise the GOP should be a big tent. “When I say that I’m going to fight alongside of you, I mean all of you—each and every one,” the vice president said at Turning Point USA’s recent AmericaFest. “President Trump did not build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless self-defeating purity tests.”

As the Nazis vs. Say-No-to-Nazis fissures broke open at the Turning Point event, conservatives on all sides of the debate laid claim to the legacy of their martyred leader Charlie Kirk. Some argued that he was a free-speech fanatic who would have welcomed everyone to TPUSA events even if they were wearing a T-shirt bearing a pro-Holocaust meme (“Let ’Em Cook”). Others agreed with Loomer’s take, that “people want to pretend like [Kirk’s] events were a free for all so they have an excuse to not call out the GOP’s Nazi problem.” Vance positioned himself on Team “Let ’Em Cook.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, seems to be with him: He caused major outcry after he defended Carlson having a very friendly interview with Holocaust denier Fuentes, in which Fuentes complained about the domination of “organized Jewry” and Carlson noted his belief that “Christian Zionists” have been “seized by this brain virus.”

The former Heritage staffers who have decamped for the new organization seem to be on Team Moral Clarity—or perhaps a team for which they don’t have to play ball with Nazis or the kinds of people who would attend a Turning Point USA convention. (That the organization they flocked to belongs to Pence—remember him? The guy the Jan. 6 rioters wanted to lynch on the White House lawn?—only adds to the sense that this cleavage runs deep.) In a not-so-long-ago iteration of the Republican Party, those who spoke and acted like Loomer, Owens, and even Kirk were the riffraff—part of the base, sure, but inconvenient and merely dog-whistled at to encourage loyalty. Now, though, they’re leading the pack, and not only when it comes to MAGA’s young pups.

It’s worth noting that in all of this, Trump is largely absent. Perhaps those closest to him see what average Americans do not: that his abilities, and with them his power, are waning. He turned the party into a cult of personality, in which the only ideology was to line up behind Donald Trump. The GOP rule “Whatever Trump wants, Trump gets” was so clear that the party stopped writing out policy platforms, instead issuing a one-page fealty pledge to its unquestioned leader. No one has the audacity to try to unseat him, or even to say that he won’t be in charge forever. MAGA stalwarts still wear their Trump 2028 hats, make Trump-as-Jesus fan art, share the triumphant photo of him raising his fist after surviving an assassin’s bullet, and believe that his 2024 win was a political resurrection divinely ordained to save America. Maybe Trumpism will never die. But clearly those around him can smell decay.

Craig Copetas had one of the most colorful beats in journalism: He wrote about the illegal drug trade for High Times magazine. “Dealers would search me out, asking me to go to Latin America to write adventure stories about them,” he told me. Another time, a guy opened up a small suitcase to give Copetas a peek at what he was holding: $1.5 million in cash.

That show-and-tell happened in December 1977, in the District of Columbia. It was a big weekend for drugs in the nation’s capital. “Everyone was coming to Washington,” Copetas remembered. “Smugglers, adventurers, scientists, musicians, lawyers, farmers, dealers, global leaders. And all of them were coming with some of the most rootin’-tootin’, scientifically produced cavalcade of recreational drugs you could imagine. And they were bringing it down in bulk.”

The occasion was a weekend conference put on by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, more commonly known as NORML. For NORML and its allies, 1977 had been an amazing year. Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina all passed decriminalization laws. And the new man in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, was urging Congress to do the same thing on a national level.

Growing, smoking, and possessing marijuana was still illegal pretty much everywhere in the United States. But by 1977, more than half of Americans under 30 had tried pot. NORML’s liberal drug agenda was winning. And now it was time to revel in all that success.

The weekend’s most extravagant event was the NORML Christmas party, held in a town house near Dupont Circle. There was a rock band, strobe lights, and a juggler. Silver trays got passed from guest to guest, some loaded down with caviar and others with joints packed with hand-cultivated marijuana.

The night was a crucial showcase for one man: Keith Stroup, the founder of NORML.

In 1977 he was 33 years old, and he answered to the nickname Mr. Marijuana. At the Christmas party, he strolled around in a blue velvet dinner jacket and burgundy bow tie, chatting up friends, colleagues, and potential funders under a haze of marijuana smoke. “Part of the thrill of being there was it was so goddamn out in the open,” he said.

Not long after 10 p.m., a guest showed up who demanded his full attention: Peter Bourne. He was the president’s top adviser on drug policy, and a man who could potentially change everything for Stroup’s movement.

Stroup was surprised and thrilled to see Bourne at the front door. The United States drug czar had turned up for a weed extravaganza. And he hadn’t dropped by to narc on anyone or to shut the whole thing down.

When it came to marijuana, Stroup and Bourne were on the same team. They believed both that America’s drug laws were horribly screwed up and that they were the people to fix them.

But that was before the NORML Christmas party. That night did end up changing everything for pot in America, but not in the way anyone expected.

Last week, almost five decades later, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to hasten the reclassification of marijuana as a Schedule 3 drug. That move would put weed in the same tier as Tylenol with codeine, loosening restrictions on research into the drug’s medical benefits. It will also be a step in the direction of full federal decriminalization or even legalization.

It all might have happened a long time ago if not for that Christmas party in 1977. The drug-fueled gathering turned out to be a turning point for Stroup and Bourne, for the Carter presidency, and for the future of marijuana.

This story was adapted from an episode of the One Year podcast. Evan Chung was the lead producer. Madeline Ducharme was the assistant producer. Listen to the full version:

The first time “Mr. Marijuana” Keith Stroup took a hit from a joint, he wasn’t sure he’d gotten high. What he did know is that the pizza he ate that night tasted “exceptionally good.”

It was the 1960s, and Stroup was at Georgetown Law School, in Washington. Back then, his main concern was avoiding the Vietnam War. He thought about getting a psychiatrist to say that he was gay, which would’ve disqualified him from the armed forces, but his wife vetoed that idea. In the end, he steered clear of military service by getting a government job.

Stroup worked for the National Commission on Product Safety. As a lawyer for the agency, he learned to do the sort of consumer advocacy made famous by Ralph Nader. In 1970 Stroup decided to put his own spin on that kind of work: He was going to lobby for marijuana smokers, just as Nader took up for consumers.

At first, Stroup’s National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws got treated as a curiosity. But he was tireless and charismatic, and he knew what he wanted to achieve. His goal was to make weed legal everywhere in the U.S. In the meantime, he pushed for a smaller, more practical step: decriminalization.

The country’s harsh marijuana laws dated back to the early 20th century, when they’d been enacted to target Black and Mexican Americans. As the demographics of marijuana users changed, so did the drug’s reputation. In 1969 Life magazine published photos of white professionals in cocktail attire toking up.

“If young, otherwise law-abiding, and essentially white people were going to start using this drug in greater numbers, people felt that they didn’t want to then burden these individuals with a criminal record,” said Emily Dufton, the author of Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America. “ ‘You know, this person is probably going to go on to have a family and a white picket fence. And do we really want to destroy their future for a little bit of harmless fun?’ ”

Still, harmless or not, marijuana was illegal. And if you got caught in the wrong place doing the wrong thing, the consequences could be extremely severe, with some people getting life sentences for marijuana-only crimes.

Plenty of Americans believed that small-time marijuana offenders weren’t really offenders at all. And so, under the right circumstances, the country might’ve been on a path to decriminalization in the late 1960s and early ’70s. But there was one very important person standing in the way.

Richard Nixon saw marijuana as a tool of his enemies: liberals, young people, and Vietnam protesters. And in Nixon’s America, those enemies needed to be policed. In 1970 he signed the federal Controlled Substances Act, which put drugs into five different categories, or schedules. The most restrictive category, Schedule 1, was for drugs that were totally outlawed, even for medical use. Among them were heroin, LSD, and marijuana.

Marijuana’s placement in Schedule 1 had to be reviewed by a commission. Given that this group was stacked with Nixon appointees, the president thought it would rubber-stamp his anti-marijuana position. But when all those Nixon appointees weighed the evidence, they did something surprising: They said marijuana wasn’t actually that bad. The commission recommended that both possession of marijuana for personal use and nonprofit distribution of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.

Nixon hated those recommendations, and so he decided to ignore them. He kept marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which it still is today. (Trump’s executive order finally looks poised to change that.)

But Nixon wasn’t all-powerful. Lawmakers across the country read the commission’s report and found it persuasive. “They began realizing that they had the capacity to change marijuana laws on the local level, and that’s what began to happen,” Dufton said.

Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana, in 1973. By 1976, six more states had done it, and a bunch of others looked as if they were moving in that direction. But for American marijuana policy to get remade, the federal government would have to be on board. There would need to be a new voice in Washington, someone with liberal views who was savvy enough to wield real political power. Someone like future drug czar Peter Bourne.

Years before he showed up at that fateful Washington party, Peter Bourne served as a doctor in Vietnam. During his stint in the military, Bourne discovered that American soldiers were finding solace in heroin. When his tour of duty was over, the Englishman moved to California and saw the dark aftermath of the Summer of Love. In San Francisco in the late 1960s, he helped set up the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. “That exposed me to widespread drug use of all kinds,” he told me.

In the early ’70s, Bourne moved to Atlanta to run a methadone clinic. He saw it as his chance to save lives. “Our goal was to have a situation where no heroin addict could say, ‘I want treatment, but there’s nowhere I can go to get it,’ ” he said.

Bourne and his clinic caught the attention of Georgia’s new governor, Jimmy Carter. Back then, Carter was an obscure figure, but Bourne believed in him. He was the first person to tell Carter that he should run for president.

Carter and Bourne became extremely close. During the 1976 presidential campaign, the governor said that Bourne was “about the closest friend I have in the world.” When Bourne talked about drugs, Carter listened. And Bourne made his views very clear. “More than anything else, people were dying in large numbers from heroin,” he said, “and you had 40 million people in the country using marijuana and nobody dying from it.”

Bourne believed that every dollar spent enforcing marijuana laws was a dollar taken away from work that really mattered. And he convinced Carter that he was right. During the 1976 campaign, Carter came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization. This was a big statement—the most liberal position on marijuana ever taken by a major-party presidential nominee.

While Carter didn’t personally approve of pot, he was no Richard Nixon. He hung out with weed-loving musicians like Willie Nelson and the Allman Brothers, and he didn’t think that everyone under 30 was plotting to destroy America.

Carter’s victory that fall marked a huge shift in U.S. politics—the end of the Nixon era, and a fresh start after Watergate and Vietnam. And Bourne had lots of ideas about how he could help his closest friend. Bourne advocated for national health insurance, and he put together a plan to end world hunger. He also talked to Carter about sending rockets to Mars.

All of that was outside Bourne’s purview. What he could do was change the country’s drug policy. Bourne’s official title was “special assistant to the president for mental health and drug abuse.” One of the people he met with was Keith Stroup. “We had so much to gain by maintaining that relationship, with Peter being so close to the president himself and so powerful in terms of drug policy,” Stroup said.

When Stroup founded NORML, he struggled to get big players to take him seriously. Now, with Carter in the White House, he became a Washington insider. Stroup smoked weed with the president’s son Chip, and he bonded with administration officials. “When the Allman Brothers were going to play a concert here in D.C., I would actually ride out to the concert with a group of White House people in a bus they had chartered,” Stroup told me. “Most of the time, we were smoking on the bus going out and smoking on the bus coming home.”

Stroup was a stoner who thought everyone in America should be free to enjoy the benefits of marijuana. Bourne was a doctor who thought that marijuana was trivial and the government should focus its resources on heroin. But from those different starting points, Mr. Marijuana and the drug czar ended up in the same place. In March 1977, Bourne told Congress that the administration “will continue to discourage marijuana use, but we feel criminal penalties that brand otherwise law-abiding people for life are neither an effective nor an appropriate deterrent.”

At times, it sounded as if the White House’s talking points on marijuana had been written by Keith Stroup. And in 1977, that actually happened.

One day, Stroup got a phone call from a junior White House speechwriter, who said that he was working on a presidential statement about marijuana policy. He asked Stroup if he’d like to come by and help him draft it. “And of course, I almost kill myself running to his place,” Stroup said.

Stroup’s most aggressive pro-pot language got edited out of that statement. But a lot of his material remained intact, including these lines:

Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marijuana in private for personal use.

The biggest headline coming out of that statement was that Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization—the first time a sitting president had ever done so. In some ways, it was just symbolic, because Carter wasn’t proposing a specific bill. But coming from the president and his drug czar, that symbolism was important.

A fundamental shift in American marijuana policy felt tantalizingly close. Bourne believed that the administration was going to get progressive legislation passed in Congress. Stroup thought that “within three or four or five years, we would have decriminalization passed in all states across the country.”

But there was another movement getting started around that same time—one that Bourne and Stroup did not see coming. It was led by two moms from Georgia.

In 1976 Marsha Keith Schuchard and her husband hosted their daughter’s 13th birthday party. There were about 20 kids in her backyard. “They asked if we could go upstairs, which we did,” she said. “And then my husband started seeing lights, like cigarette lights, going on all over. … And he went down to see what was happening, and it wasn’t cigarettes. It was joints. It was booze. And it was quite a shock.”

Schuchard doesn’t fit the stereotype of a drug warrior. She has a doctorate in English, and she identifies as a liberal Democrat. Living in Atlanta in the ’60s and ’70s, she fought for voting rights and school desegregation. But when Schuchard caught her daughter smoking pot, she found a new cause.

Schuchard called herself a “do-it-yourself drug-abuse professional.” She believed that parents could fight back against drug culture by sharing tips and resources and creating a supportive and safe community.

“They set uniform rules for all of their kids. They weren’t allowed to read High Times magazine. They had a curfew,” said Dufton, who wrote about Schuchard in her book Grass Roots. And in the parents’ eyes, those rules seemed to work.

The neighborhood kids called them the Nosy Parents Association. By 1977, Schuchard had brought her nosiness nationwide, co-founding the Parents’ Resource Institute for Drug Education. “What Schuchard was tapping into was that these were legitimate fears that a lot of people were having about their kids, but no one was speaking to it,” Dufton said.

Adolescent marijuana usage was on the rise in the mid-1970s, and pro-pot messages were everywhere. In magazines like High Times, Head, and Stone Age; on Saturday Night Live and in movies like The Groove Tube and Car Wash; and in Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It” and Neil Young’s “Homegrown.” And it was getting easier every day to find a shop that carried pipes and rolling papers.

In Atlanta, Schuchard’s friend Sue Rusche had promised her kids she’d buy them a Star Wars record. When they walked into the record store, what they found instead was a glass display case full of “Star Wars–like bongs.” Rusche went to more stores, and found more kid-friendly products: a Frisbee that was also a hash pipe, and a book called Tots Who Toke. “I know the power of advertising. I learned it in graphic design school,” Rusche told me. “And to think that people would target children was just inexplicable and abhorrent.”

The idea that pot was endangering impressionable, vulnerable children was a potent political message. In 1977 Schuchard and Rusche were starting to spread it. Whenever they spoke to parents groups, they’d bring along what they called the “bong show.” “The first thing we did was show them what the paraphernalia looked like and suggest that they try to find it in their community, and they always did,” Rusche said.

NORML’s Stroup had not accounted for any of this when he made his push for decriminalization. And when the parents from Atlanta started to get traction, he still didn’t think they were a real threat.

“Their philosophy was: If it’s unsafe for kids, then you shouldn’t legalize it. And of course, that’s a stupid standard,” Stroup said. “If that was the standard, adults couldn’t drive or fly airplanes or have sex. I thought because that premise was so wrongheaded that we didn’t have to worry about them.”

It was always unlikely that Mr. Marijuana and the nosy parents would find common ground. But Schuchard thought she might have a chance to win over the drug czar.

She got an audience with Peter Bourne in December 1977, at a conference on drug abuse. She told him about middle schoolers smoking pot, and she pulled out a bag of marijuana publications that she’d bought at a suburban shopping mall. Bourne listened to what she had to say and looked at what she’d brought. And the drug czar was totally unmoved. Schuchard said that he was “indifferent, rude, dismissive.”

Bourne was similarly unimpressed. He told me that the parents “didn’t know anything about drug abuse” and “couldn’t explain their position in any sort of public-health terms.” When I asked Bourne if he thought it was legitimate to be concerned about 13-year-olds smoking marijuana, he said that it didn’t bother him that much—that “when you compare it to more than 1,000 dying each month from heroin, it’s a misplacement of priorities.”

So that’s where Stroup and Bourne were in December 1977: entrenched in their positions, confident in their success, and unafraid to antagonize their opponents. What they didn’t realize was that they were about to make enemies with each other. And it would all start at the Christmas party.

NORML’s annual conference in D.C. featured seminars on marijuana and the law, marijuana and science, and marijuana and women. There were also plenty of opportunities to get a more practical education on the American drug scene.

“Wherever we went that weekend, people were coming up to us and offering us drugs,” remembered Craig Copetas of High Times magazine. “It was like backstage at a Rolling Stones concert.”

That weekend, Copetas shared a hotel suite with his friend Hunter S. Thompson. The way Patrick Anderson tells it in his book High in America, a conferencegoer sidled up to Thompson during a luncheon attended by roughly 300 people and passed the writer some cocaine. Copetas then held up a copy of the New York Times, which they used to shield themselves as they enjoyed the gift they’d just received.

“Oh, dear. The things we did in our youth, huh?” Copetas told me when I asked about that moment. “I will plead the Fifth Amendment on that. Although I will say I did hold up a New York Times.”

Later that same day, Dec. 10, 1977, Copetas and Thompson headed over to the big NORML Christmas party. The 600 attendees who had crammed themselves into a D.C. town house that evening were typical Washington creatures: political staffers, journalists, do-gooder nonprofit types. That night, they saw a rock band and strobe lights and a juggler and silver trays full of caviar and joints. They saw Keith Stroup, Mr. Marijuana, presiding over it all. Then they saw Peter Bourne, the White House drug czar, walk through the front door.

Bourne got a hero’s welcome—hugs and handshakes from marijuana lovers who appreciated everything he’d done for their cause. For Stroup, Bourne was his guy on the inside, and it was important to keep him happy. So he paid close attention when a friend passed along a message. Those words, in Stroup’s memory: “Peter says he wouldn’t mind doing a line of coke.”

“My first reaction was: ‘What? Did I hear—did I hear you right?’ ” Stroup said. His second reaction was to go looking for cocaine. The way Stroup tells it, he tracked down some coke, then asked Bourne to go upstairs to a private room.

“Everyone in the house could see who was going up that stair. It was like a stage,” Copetas told me. Stroup said, “It was kind of almost incriminating to be seen walking up there.”

Copetas declined to tell me exactly what happened next, “because that was a private interlude as far as I’m concerned and always will be.” But Stroup didn’t hold back. He said, “We sat around and all did a few lines of coke and then, OK, better get back down and say hello to some more people. And Peter said, ‘Yeah, I need to get going too.’ And we left.”

Copetas did say this, about the aftermath of that get-together: “After I went back to sit down, Hunter looked at me and said, ‘Jesus Christ, Craig, we’re all going to be indicted now.’ ”

But Stroup was more excited than paranoid. “Shit, snorting a line with the president’s drug czar?” he said. “This is not a bad thing in that it means that we have some secrets we’re now sharing. We have some intimate moments that we haven’t had before.”

Word spread quickly inside the town house: Peter Bourne, the drug czar, had done cocaine.

When I asked Bourne what he remembered about the party, he said “very little”—that it was “just sort of the usual crowd, the strong Carter supporters.”

He denied asking for cocaine that night. He told me that claim was “so untrue.”

“I may have been stupid enough to go to the party, but I had no interest in doing cocaine,” he said. “I would have gone somewhere else if I had wanted to do that. There may have been cocaine there at some point, but I was not a participant.”

I asked Bourne if he used cocaine at all, outside the party.

His answer: “I’ve never used cocaine. Have I? I don’t think so. Because I was very careful never to use marijuana or go anywhere where I would smoke marijuana. So, you know, being that cautious, I don’t know why in the world I would use cocaine.”

The NORML Christmas party ended around 4 a.m., with something like a dozen people passed out around the town house. The political staffers, the journalists, and the do-gooder nonprofit types all went back home, and back to work. For the next few months, life in Washington carried on as usual. And then, very suddenly, everything blew up.

The undoing of Peter Bourne began on a Friday afternoon in July 1978, when a young woman came to him and said she was having trouble sleeping. She asked Bourne if he could write her a prescription for sleeping pills.

That woman worked for Bourne at the White House. And he could prescribe her medication since he was a licensed doctor. So that day he wrote her a prescription for Quaaludes.

Quaaludes were extremely popular in the ’70s, as sleeping pills but also as an aphrodisiac. Bourne told the woman that he’d give her a pseudonym for the Quaalude prescription so it wouldn’t show up if she ever tried to get a security clearance. “It’s a regular practice if you have somebody who wants to keep their use of drugs confidential,” he told me.

The woman, Bourne’s aide, asked a friend to pick up her prescription. When that friend went to the drugstore, a pharmacy inspector happened to be there, doing routine rounds. The woman’s friend got arrested for “attempting to obtain a controlled substance by the use of a false name.” And when it came out that the drug czar’s name was on the prescription, the story was all over the national news.

Bourne thought it would eventually blow over. But the day after the Quaalude story came out, investigative reporter Jack Anderson went on ABC’s Good Morning America to deliver some new information: Three witnesses had seen the drug czar, Peter Bourne, snort cocaine at the NORML Christmas party.

Anderson’s report didn’t name any of the three witnesses, but it did say they had “provided complete and convincing details.”

“Like an idiot,” Stroup told me, “I somehow managed to take what was a confined scandal and find a way to put myself in the middle of it.”

Why did Stroup tell a reporter that Bourne had done coke? Bourne was the best ally he’d ever had. Together, they’d been spreading the gospel of decriminalization across the country.

But Stroup had become convinced that American marijuana smokers were in danger of being killed. And he thought the Carter administration, and Bourne, was complicit.

The issue was an herbicide called paraquat. The Mexican government was spraying paraquat on poppy and marijuana fields, using helicopters provided by the United States. And so, the theory went, anyone who smoked pot imported from Mexico might be inhaling paraquat. “I remember at the time there were articles saying that even a teaspoon of paraquat on your tongue and you’d have an agonizing death. It’s that strong,” Stroup said.

Stroup told Bourne that all this needed to stop—that marijuana smokers were in grave danger. But Bourne didn’t buy it.

“I thought it was all bullshit,” he said. “We paid thousands of dollars to have it analyzed. … I mean, the paraquat thing was totally scientifically wrong.”

There’s not much clear evidence that paraquat ever harmed American marijuana smokers. But the chemical is extremely toxic, and Stroup was disgusted that Bourne thought that was no big deal.

Stroup and Bourne had found common ground on decriminalization. But they were now on opposite sides of what Stroup considered an existential issue. Stroup had been able to look past that tension in 1977. But in the first few months of 1978, he began to view Bourne’s actions as unforgivable. “At that point, it was like, Jesus Christ, Peter, if you’re going to play life and death, don’t forget, I got something over here too.”

The something that Stroup had was his story about the NORML Christmas party. A bunch of reporters had seen Bourne at the party, and plenty of them had heard whispers about the drug czar doing coke. One of those journalists worked for Anderson. In the weeks after the party, that reporter pestered Stroup to confirm the cocaine rumors.

Stroup initially refused, but now he changed his mind. He was ready to talk. And he gave up the names of two other witnesses.

He said that all of this was off the record—for now. But five months later, after the Quaalude news broke, Stroup gave his blessing for the cocaine story to get aired, so long as his name was not attached. On July 21, 1978, on Good Morning America, the bomb Stroup planted finally went off.

When the news broke, Bourne told his colleagues at the White House that he’d seen cocaine at the party but that he hadn’t used it. That explanation was not enough to save the drug czar’s job. At a news conference, Jimmy Carter announced, “Dr. Peter Bourne, out of consideration for my administration, has submitted his resignation this afternoon, which I have accepted with regret.”

Bourne didn’t leave the White House quietly. After he resigned, he told the New York Times that marijuana use was commonplace at the White House. He also said that “a few” of his colleagues did cocaine. A couple of days later, Carter sent a memo to the White House staff. “I expect [everyone] to obey the law,” the president said. “You will obey it, or you will seek employment elsewhere.”

Stroup hadn’t been named in the Good Morning America story that took down Bourne. But he did give a quote to the Washington Post and basically outed himself as the original source.

After that, Stroup got out of town, going to Las Vegas to hang out with his friend Willie Nelson and clear his head. “By the time I got back to D.C., I realized two things,” he said. “That Peter had ended up being hurt more than he deserved, and … that my career with NORML almost certainly was coming to an end.”

Stroup had severed his connection to the White House, and he’d done it recklessly: “Any idiot should have recognized that even if I felt threatened about paraquat spraying or even if I was angry about something else, that didn’t justify destroying that point of access to power.”

The founder of NORML had also violated the drug user’s code: You don’t snort and tell. Stroup issued an apology, but too much damage had been done. In December 1978, at NORML’s annual conference, he delivered his farewell speech as the group’s executive director. A year earlier, that conference had been a nonstop celebration, and Stroup and Bourne had seemed indestructible. Now they’d both been disgraced, and their downfall had profound consequences for the pro-marijuana movement they’d been working to build.

Before the Bourne scandal, a relaxed approach to marijuana had fit in perfectly with the Carter administration’s priorities. Afterward, the White House pulled back from anything that might be perceived as soft on drugs. Bourne’s successor as drug czar declared that both he and the president “adamantly oppose the use of marijuana, period.”

For the parent activists from Atlanta, Bourne’s ouster was the opening they needed. In the early days of the Carter administration, Marsha Keith Schuchard had gotten iced out. Now she scored an invitation to the newly anti-marijuana White House, where she made her pitch about how weed was damaging kids.

In 1979 the National Institute on Drug Abuse published a booklet researched and written by Schuchard. It was called Parents, Peers, and Pot. It told the story of her daughter’s smoke-filled 13th birthday party, and everything that came after. The booklet was full of alarming claims, including that marijuana might cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys. Government scientists found Schuchard’s prose hyperbolic, but the public ate it up. “After a million copies were ordered, they stopped printing it because they said we have too many orders,” Schuchard said.

When Ronald and Nancy Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, the parent activists became even more influential. Schuchard said that when she told Nancy Reagan she was a liberal, the first lady responded that it was a nonpartisan movement and they were all in this together. “I had to give her credit for that,” Schuchard said.

Marijuana usage peaked in America in 1979, then fell in every age category in the 1980s. Decriminalization stopped cold. A few months before Bourne had resigned as the White House drug czar, Nebraska became the 11th state to decriminalize marijuana. No other states followed suit in the next two decades.

Peter Bourne is 86 now. When we spoke a few years ago, he was splitting his time between northern Virginia and a farm in Wales, where he and his wife were raising llamas. When I asked him if he’d been the most progressive drug czar of all time, he said, “Yes, by far.”

Seventeen years after Keith Stroup resigned, he got rehired as NORML’s executive director. He’s now the group’s legal counsel. In his early 80s, Stroup finally sees the world he’d always imagined beginning to take shape. In Virginia, where he lives, it’s legal for adults 21 and older to possess, consume, and grow small amounts of marijuana. At the end of our interview, he invited me to come over and light one up sometime.

Stroup has said that ratting out Peter Bourne was the “stupidest decision” he ever made. He said the most recent time they ran into each other was more than 10 years ago, at a cocktail party. While they did stop and chat for a minute, “neither of us tried to make a move to say, You want to get a beer sometime?” Stroup told me. “I think we both recognized that we had passed that point of no return a long time ago.”

When I asked Bourne how much he blamed Stroup for his downfall, he stopped to consider the question for a brief moment. Then he answered: “I suppose, quite a lot.”

Bourne told me that back in the 1970s, he hadn’t understood what Stroup was doing—why he’d been so outraged, paranoid, and hell-bent on destroying what had been a productive partnership. But now, he said, he thinks he gets what was going on. “I don’t think I’m betraying confidences, but what I was unaware of then was that he had a serious cocaine problem,” he said. “I can see that he wasn’t wielding good judgment.”

“I don’t doubt that cocaine had something to do with it, sure,” Stroup told me. “You get very ragged when you’re doing cocaine. You get irritable, sometimes you get angry [about] things that wouldn’t make you angry otherwise. The cocaine use was not helpful. I don’t think I can use it as an excuse, but it probably did cause my responses to be exaggerated at times.”

Stroup and Bourne will never agree about what happened in that private room at the NORML Christmas party. But here, there’s something approaching consensus: Mr. Marijuana dropped a dime on the drug czar for doing cocaine because he himself was doing too much cocaine. And that is how the pro-pot movement of the 1970s went up in smoke.

All this week, What Next and What Next: TBD are re-airing some of our favorite conversations from throughout the year and checking back with the people in those conversations to see how things have – or haven’t – changed. This episode is from October.

In an executive order, Donald Trump declared “Antifa” a terrorist organization. As it isn’t an organization, there aren’t leaders to target, so zealous conservatives took aim at Mark Bray, a Rutgers professor who wrote a book about fighting fascism eight years ago. The clumsy attempts to get him fired didn’t bother him—but the doxxing and death threats were enough to convince him he needed to leave America.

Guest: Mark Bray, assistant teaching professor at Rutgers, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft wants to translate its codebase to Rust, and is hiring people to make it happen.

“My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030,” Microsoft distinguished engineer Galen Hunt wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.

“Our strategy is to combine AI and Algorithms to rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases,” he added. “Our North Star is ‘1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code.’”

Hunt’s post mentions a job ad for a Principal Software Engineer who will be expected to work on the tools Microsoft is building to pull this off.

“The purpose of this … role is to help us evolve and augment our infrastructure to enable translating Microsoft’s largest C and C++ systems to Rust,” Hunt wrote.

Microsoft has already built some tools to make the move.

“We’ve built a powerful code processing infrastructure,” Hunt wrote. “Our algorithmic infrastructure creates a scalable graph over source code at scale. Our AI processing infrastructure then enables us to apply AI agents, guided by algorithms, to make code modifications at scale.”

Whoever gets the job will work within Microsoft’s Future of Scalable Software Engineering group, a team Hunt says has a mission to “build capabilities to allow Microsoft and our customers to eliminate technical debt at scale.”

“We pioneer new tools and techniques with internal customers and partners, and then work with other product groups to deploy those capabilities at scale across Microsoft and across the industry,” he wrote.

Unlike C and C++, Rust is a memory-safe language, meaning it uses automated memory management to avoid out-of-bounds reads and writes, and use-after-free errors, as both offer attackers a chance to control devices. In recent years, governments have called for universal adoption of memory-safe languages – and especially Rust – to improve software security.

Microsoft has also called for greater use of Rust. In 2022, the CTO of the company’s Azure cloud called Rust to become the default language for new projects. Microsoft scientists have worked on a tool that automatically converts some C code to Rust.

The software behemoth has also created tools to help developers write Windows drivers using Rust.

Microsoft offers a vast array of products. The site MSportals.io lists over 500 active online portals for managing Microsoft products! The company also has a huge internal IT estate.

The effort required to re-write all that must surely be beyond enormous. It will doubtless surface huge numbers of edge cases that automation can’t address.

If you’re brave enough to want to make a contribution, the job Hunt mentions requires you to work three days a week in Microsoft’s Redmond office and pays between $139,900 and $274,800 a year. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/aws_storage_gateway_nutanix_ahv/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services has given Nutanix a lovely Christmas present: Support for its AHV hypervisor in hybrid cloud storage rigs.

AWS is keen on anything that drives demand for its services, and one of the tools it uses to get users interested in its cloudy storage offerings is the Storage Gateway, a tool that connects hypervisors to its Simple Storage Service (S3).

The cloud giant previously made Storage Gateway available as a workload for VMware’s ESXi, Microsoft’s Hyper-V, and Linux KVM.

On Monday, AWS announced support for AHV, too.

As AWS noted in its announcement, AHV is KVM-based, suggesting it wasn’t a stretch to add support for Nutanix.

Amazon’s enthusiasm for AHV emerged just 12 days after Nutanix delivered the integration with Pure Storage that it announced in May 2025. The company’s tie-up with Pure followed a similar deal with Dell. Both reflect Nutanix’s admission that while its native software-defined storage is an excellent offering, the majority of its current and potential customers aren’t going to stop using external arrays any time soon.

Nutanix is often the first name on any list of VMware alternatives written by organizations who feel that Broadcom’s acquisition of the virtualization giant means they need to consider the market for server virtualization and private cloud tools. Broadcom created such sentiments by focusing its sales efforts on Cloud Foundation, an integrated suite that powers private clouds, and making it hard for customers to buy its less capable products.

Broadcom argues that its customers will be better off adopting Cloud Foundation, and counters criticism that the bundle is expensive by arguing those who adopt it fully will enjoy swift and substantial ROI. Analyst firm Gartner, however, believes Broadcom’s actions will see VMware lose 35 percent of the workloads it currently manages within three years.

Nutanix execs have told The Register that its discussions with VMware users have shifted from inquisitive exploration to implementation contemplation.

With Nutanix on the cusp of potential growth, and already open to expanding its storage options, it’s unsurprising AWS wants to make sure it’s in a position to get its share of the action. ®

The Notice is the result of an investigation into China’s semiconductor industry that the Biden administration commenced in December 2024, and which focused on “foundational semiconductors (also known as legacy or mature node semiconductors), including to the extent that they are incorporated as components into downstream products for critical industries like defense, automotive, medical devices, aerospace, telecommunications, and power generation and the electrical grid.”

The investigation found,“For decades, China has targeted the semiconductor industry for dominance and has employed increasingly aggressive and sweeping non-market policies and practices in pursuing dominance of the sector.” Those practices, the document concludes, “severely disadvantaged U.S. companies, workers, and the U.S. economy generally.”

The Notice therefore concludes that tariffs on Chinese chips are appropriate, but not urgent because the document sets them at zero percent until mid-2027.

The US will increase tariffs on June 23rd, 2027, and will decide the rate of that impost no fewer than 30 days before the aforementioned date.

Also on Monday, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer penned an opinion piece arguing that tariffs are a tool that brings trading partners to the negotiating table to discuss investments that help the Trump administration pursue its goal of re-industrializing America.

The administration has therefore given Chinese chipmakers time to contemplate whether they want to open for business in the USA.

Similar negotiating tactics and incentives offered under the CHIPS Act have already seen foreign chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung make massive investments in manufacturing on US soil, and Intel resolve to build factories at home instead of offshore.

In remarks made in January and August, President Trump suggested imported semiconductors could attract tariffs of “25, 50 or even 100 percent.”

Levies at that level are nowhere to be found in this week’s announcements. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/servicenow_to_buy_armis_in/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After over a week of speculation, ServiceNow announced on Tuesday that it has agreed to buy cybersecurity heavyweight Armis in a $7.75 billion deal that will see the workflow giant incorporate a real-time security intelligence feed into its products.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026. ServiceNow said it will finance the transaction with a combination of cash and debt.

Once the deal is done, ServiceNow plans to join its CMDB (Configuration Management Database) – which maps all of an organization&#39;s IT assets – with Armis’ data discovery tools to let customers see vulnerabilities, prioritize their risks, and close holes with automated workflows. The two companies already have several integrations that connect Armis data and insights to ServiceNow, but expect the acquisition will deepen those links.

ServiceNow’s security revenue is currently around $1 billion a year. The company hopes buying Armis will triple that figure.

In its statement, ServiceNow said customers will no longer have to rely on a patchwork of software solutions to keep their estates safe.

“Modern cyber risk doesn’t stay neatly confined to a single silo, and with security built into the ServiceNow AI Platform, neither will we,” Amit Zavery, president, chief operating officer, and chief product officer at ServiceNow said in a statement.

Armis has 950 employees, annual recurring revenue of $340 million, and is headquartered in San Francisco. It is a 2025 leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cyber-Physical Systems Protection Platforms.

Also this month, ServiceNow announced the acquisition of Veza, an identity access tool to manage AI agents and control who and what has access to its customers’ systems.

The company has been on a spending spree this year with deals to acquire Armis, Cueln, Data.World, Logik.ai, Quality 360, and Veza.

Forrester vice president and principal analyst Charles Betz told The Register on Tuesday that the Armis acquisition is a “serious expansion” of ServiceNow’s capabilities.

“Armis gives ServiceNow massive volumes of data that they have not previously had before in their CMDB,” he said. “This takes their existing discovery tools’ capabilities and makes them an order of magnitude more powerful. That’s the big economic boost.”

He said that, taken together with the Data.World acquisition, it signals that ServiceNow is looking at how it manages data “very strategically.” Data.World is a cloud-native data catalog and data governance platform built for large enterprises. It takes vast corporate data sets and makes them searchable and mappable.

“This is a strategic pairing because a) they’re going to have massive new volumes of data that come in and b) with the Data.World acquisition they have the ability to develop and use that data strategically and bring it into contact with AI,” Betz told The Register. “It’s a strategic play. It says we’re in this for the long haul.”

Even prior to the acquisitions, he said ServiceNow is in a league of its own when it comes to ITSM. He said that while Salesforce’s recent announcement that it launched its own ITSM tool is the most credible threat to ServiceNow, the latter company is years ahead in terms of development.

“As a company, ServiceNow doesn’t have any comparables,” he said. “Salesforce is five years behind. I stand by what I said. They’re still the most credible threat, but being the most credible threat still doesn’t mean you’re really a threat. If you have a cat and a mouse in the room, the mouse is the most credible threat to the cat.”

The one area that ServiceNow customers will be watching is how well the company integrates Armis, Data.World, and the other acquisitions into its platform, Betz said.

ServiceNow’s Heath Ramsey, the company’s group vice president of outbound project management for the AI platform, last week told The Register the company will treat its new acquisitions the same way it has treated previous buys, meticulously integrating code bases to create a better platform.

“That kind of approach has allowed us to not only acquire companies, but we build that into the code and the ability and the capabilities of the platform to ensure that our customers are able to get access to it very, very seamlessly, and that it all works together,” he said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thousands of Nissan customers are learning that some of their personal data was leaked after unauthorized access to a Red Hat-managed server, according to the Japanese automaker.

About 21,000 customers who purchased a vehicle or had service done at the former Nissan Fukuoka Motor Co. (now Nissan Fukuoka Sales Co.) were affected by a digital intrusion detected in September, the company said in a December breach disclosure.

While the crooks reportedly did not steal any credit card information, leaked personal details include customers&#39; addresses, names, phone numbers, partial email addresses, and other customer-related information used for sales activities.

&quot;At this time, there has been no confirmation that the leaked information has been used for secondary purposes,&quot; the car manufacturer said in a Japanese-language report translated via Google, adding that customers should be on high alert for suspicious calls or mail - all of these stolen details can be valuable to criminals in targeted phishing attacks or other financial fraud.

&quot;Nissan takes this incident very seriously and will strengthen its monitoring of its subcontractors and take further steps to strengthen information security,&quot; the company noted. &quot;We would like to once again offer our deepest apologies to our customers for any inconvenience caused.&quot;

The IBM-owned open source software maker previously disclosed that &quot;an unauthorized third party had accessed and copied some data from a Red Hat Consulting-managed, dedicated GitLab instance.&quot;

According to the Nissan breach notification, Red Hat detected the intruders on September 26, and then alerted the automaker on October 3.

Nissan did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries, including who was responsible for the data theft and whether the criminals had tried to extort the carmaker. We will update this story if we receive a response.

While neither Nissan nor Red Hat named a specific criminal group in their statements, in early October, a group called Crimson Collective claimed to have broken into Red Hat&#39;s private GitLab repositories and exfiltrated some 570 GB of compressed data, including sensitive documents belonging to customers.

A day later, Red Hat confirmed the breach.

Shortly after, Crimson Collective said it had teamed up with the ShinyHunters-linked &quot;Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters&quot; gang to extort the IBM-owned biz.

This is the auto manufacturer&#39;s third major breach in as many years.

In May 2024, Nissan admitted personal information belonging to more than 50,000 of its North American employees, both current and former, had been stolen in a November 2023 &quot;targeted cyber attack.&quot;

Two months prior, Nissan disclosed that its Oceania division&#39;s IT systems had been hit by the Akira ransomware gang, which stole personal information belonging to more than 100,000 customers. The Akira attack reportedly occurred in December 2023. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As if to underscore the need to avoid the Kessler Syndrome, a scenario in which cascading debris can make some orbits difficult to use, a Starlink satellite vented propellant and released debris following an onboard &quot;anomaly&quot; late last week.

The incident, described by observers as &quot;likely caused by an internal energetic source&quot; rather than a collision, resulted in a loss of communication. According to Starlink, the result was a venting of the propellant tank and &quot;the release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects.&quot;

The satellite, Starlink 35956, was launched on November 23, 2025, as part of the Starlink Group 11-30-13 mission, according to Jonathan McDowell&#39;s satellite list. Its altitude was 418 km when communication was lost and is now tumbling, although still intact. In a post on X, Starlink stated that the satellite &quot;will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks.&quot;

&quot;The satellite&#39;s current trajectory will place it below the @Space_Station, posing no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.&quot;

It is not clear what caused the &quot;energetic&quot; event. Starlink wrote that &quot;our engineers are rapidly working to root cause and mitigate the source of the anomaly and are already in the process of deploying software to our vehicles that increases protections against this type of event.&quot;

Former Space Shuttle astronaut and International Space Station (ISS) crew member Ed Lu noted that &quot;hundreds&quot; of debris objects associated with the incident were being tracked, and had already spread out to 6,000 km over the orbital track within a few days. Lu is co-founder and CTO of LeoLabs, a business specializing in tracking objects in orbit.

The incident came days after a SpaceX executive claimed that a Chinese satellite launch came within 200 meters of colliding with a Starlink vehicle. It is therefore reassuring to know that SpaceX does not require the assistance of another space-faring power when it comes to unplanned debris-generating incidents in orbit.

Joking aside, the loss of communication, venting of propellant, and creation of an unknown amount of debris are a concern as low Earth orbit becomes more crowded.

Researchers recently proposed a &quot;CRASH Clock&quot; to indicate how long it could take before something catastrophic happens if all collision-avoidance maneuvers cease. While Starlink 35956 should burn up in Earth&#39;s atmosphere within a few weeks, the incident highlights the danger posed by debris and how easily and quickly the debris load in Low Earth Orbit can grow. ®

            <div id="article-text">Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

It’s a good thing that we already know a second season of Pluribus is on the way. Because the season finale for the show — a sci-fi drama on Apple TV, helmed by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — made it clear that things are just getting started. The episode brought together a number of significant threads but, more importantly, opened up potentially explosive (literally) new lines of inquiry for what comes next.

Spoiler to follow for the first season of Pluribus.

First, a little reminder of how we got here. The inciting incident of Pluribus was the release of a virus of unknown, but extraterrestrial, origins, that turned almost the entirety of the Earth’s human population into an interconnected hive mind. The hive are peaceful, to the point that they won’t even kill a bug or pick an apple off of a tree, and they are physically harmed by negative emotions. There are around a dozen people who weren’t impacted by the virus. Most notably this includes an American woman named Carol (Rhea Seehorn) and a Paraguayan man named Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga). For most of the season, the pair have been separated physically, but united in being vehemently opposed to the hive’s presence, while trying to figure out a way to “save” the world by making it the way it used to be.

The finale sees these two finally able to meet up with each other — but things have changed for Carol. In the penultimate episode, her feelings toward the hive began to soften, primarily as she grew closer to her chaperone Zosia (Karolina Wydra). In fact, by the time the finale starts, they’re a full-on couple. It’s a far cry from the early days of the show, when Carol was so antagonistic to the hive that they abandoned her and the city of Albuquerque for safety reasons.

But Carol’s new view of the hive, and Zosia in particular, means that things don’t go quite the way Manousos expected. Instead of finding a like-minded comrade who would help him “save the world,” he finds a version of Carol that is reluctant to even speak to him. The dynamic is much like Pluribus’ second episode, in which Carol fails to convince the rest of the survivors that they should work toward putting the world back the way it was. Only this time the roles are reversed. Combine this dynamic with the fact that Carol and Manousos are both extremely stubborn people who are using Google Translate to communicate and, well, it’s not exactly a smooth meeting. After the first time the two talk, Manousos mutters to himself “well this is going just great.”

By the end of the episode, though, the two seem largely on the same page. And that’s because Carol learns that, despite her budding romance with Zosia, the hive are still diligently working on bringing her into the fold (the episode actually opens by showing one of the other survivors joining the hive via a new procedure). This all culminates with Carol receiving a large package that turns out to be an atom bomb. I guess she wasn’t joking earlier in the season.

The first season of Pluribus has been a learning experience. While there are plenty of postapocalyptic shows, there’s really nothing quite like this strange, hive-mind-infected version of Earth. And so over nine episodes we see Carol emotionally coming to grips with her new reality, but also using that time to learn as much as she can about how the hive operates. This, in turn, helps us, the audience, understand just what the heck is going on. All stories require some kind of scene-setting, but Pluribus’ unique nature requires that much more.

But the reveal of the atom bomb at the end suggests that things are going in a different direction in season 2. I don’t expect Pluribus to suddenly become a fast-paced show; its measured pace is part of its appeal and allows it to really dig into the nitty-gritty details of the world. But many of the remaining plotlines and questions require more action than simply learning more about the hive. Manousos may have figured out a way to pull individuals out of the hive using radio signals; the hive are in the midst of building a “giant antenna” to possibly communicate with whoever or whatever sent the virus in the first place; the rest of the survivors have to decide whether or not they want to join; the hive need to sort out a solution to their impending food crisis; and, oh, there’s that bomb that Carol may or may not have a plan for.

I don’t know how many seasons the Pluribus story can reasonably stretch for, but it’s clear it needed at least two, just because there’s so much to set up. It’s not all that different from Apple TV’s other delightfully weird sci-fi series, Severance, a show that had a similarly unique premise and really pulled everything together by the end of its second season. Now we’ll have to wait and see if Pluribus can do the same.

﻿The five sanctioned individuals included Thierry Breton and Imran Ahmed, who feuded with Elon Musk.

On Tuesday, the Trump Administration followed through on a threat of retaliation targeting foreigners who are involved in content moderation. The State Department announced sanctions barring US access for former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, as well as four researchers, while issuing an intentionally chilling threat to others, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio claiming, “The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course.”

One of the researchers the State Department says is banned and now deportable, is Imran Ahmed, who runs the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), an organization aimed at identifying and pushing back against hate speech online that Elon Musk tried and failed to censor with a lawsuit that was dismissed in early 2024. In his decision, Judge Charles Breyer wrote that X’s motivation for suing was to “punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp. — and perhaps in order to dissuade others.”

Breton is called “a mastermind of the Digital Services Act” by US Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers, who specifically referenced a letter he sent to Elon Musk ahead of a livestreamed event with Donald Trump that noted X’s legal obligations under the DSA relating to illegal content and disinformation.

The other researchers include Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, leaders of HateAid, a nonprofit that tried to sue X in 2023 for “failing to remove criminal antisemitic content,” as well as Clare Melford, leader of the Global Disinformation Index, which works on “fixing the systems that enable disinformation.”

The press release announcing the sanctions is titled “Announcement of Actions to Combat the Global Censorship-Industrial Complex,” the claimed target of Republicans like House Judiciary Committee leader Jim Jordan, as they’ve worked against attempts to apply fact-checking and misinformation research to social networks. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the State Department ordered US consulates to consider rejecting H-1B visa applicants involved in content moderation, and a few days ago, the Office of the US Trade Representative threatened retaliation against European tech giants like Spotify and SAP over supposedly “discriminatory” activity in regulating US tech platforms.

            <div id="article-text">Following Europe and Japan, Apple is opening things up for iOS users in Brazil.

Following Europe and Japan, Apple is opening things up for iOS users in Brazil.

Apple is set to allow third-party app stores on iOS in Brazil next year after settling with the country’s competition watchdog in a legal battle dating back to 2022, as reported by 9to5Mac.

According to a machine translation of a press release from the Brazilian regulator CADE, it has approved a Term of Commitment to Termination (TCC) made by Apple that obligates the company to allow third-party app stores and let developers use external payment systems. Warnings about third-party app stores and external payment systems must also have neutral wording.

Apple will be able to still charge fees, and the Brazilian publication Tecnoblog says in a machine translation that, according to CADE, those fees are:

Commission of 25% (general) or 10% (special programs)

App purchases on the App Store, but directed outside the store:

No fee if the routing involves static text (no clickable link/button)

15% fee if the owner of the app puts a button/link and directs to payment on his own website (outside the app environment)

Apple has argued against opening up iOS on the grounds that it could compromise the platform’s security. But regulation in other countries has already forced the company to let users in Europe and Japan install third-party app stores, and in the US, Apple allows for external payment links.

Apple has 105 days to put the changes into place, and if it doesn’t comply with its obligations, it could be subject to a fine of up to R$150 million (about $27 million).

The company shared the following statement with 9to5Mac about the decision:

In order to comply with regulatory demands from CADE, Apple is making changes that will impact iOS apps in Brazil. While these changes will open new privacy and security risks to users, we have worked to maintain protections against some threats, including keeping in place important safeguards for younger users. These safeguards will not eliminate every risk, but they will help ensure that iOS remains the best, most secure mobile platform available in Brazil and we will continue to advocate on behalf of users and developers.

Update, December 23rd: Added fee structure reported by Tecnoblog.

If you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone — or on the hunt for a solid last-minute gift — Google’s Pixel 10 is a great place to look. We consider it the best Android phone you can buy, and right now, you can grab it at Amazon starting at $449 ($350 off) when you use promo code PIXEL10, which drops Google’s entry-level flagship to its lowest price to date. If you prefer a better cameras or a bigger screen, Amazon is also offering the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL for $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, using the same code.

In her review, Verge senior reviewer Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone that offers some notable upgrades over its predecessor. It features a 6.3-inch OLED screen and a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, making it easy to see in direct sunlight. It also includes an array of helpful AI-powered tools and a dedicated telephoto camera — a first for a non-Pro Pixel phone — which is great for capturing portrait photos.

One of the Pixel 10’s more notable upgrades, though, is the addition of Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets — arguably the coolest part of the device — which means you don’t need a separate case for easy and precise charging alignment. The device also includes Google’s Tensor G5 chip, which is the same one found in the pricier Pro models; however, the Pixel 10 has slightly lower RAM (12GB versus 16GB). Still, you shouldn’t notice any major differences in everyday performance, unless you’re really pushing it with heavy multitasking and serious mobile gaming.

Our main gripe with the Pixel 10 is that its main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as those on the Pro. That said, the standard Pixel produces pictures that are perfectly fine, while the telephoto camera makes for a nice addition. At its normal $799 price, we think the Pixel 10 is already a great value. At $449, it’s a dang good deal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Samsung is breaking new ground with its 2026 lineup of gaming monitors, with the Odyssey 3D G90XH becoming the first to feature a 6K display with “glasses-free 3D.” The new monitor comes with a 32-inch IPS panel, offering real-time eye-tracking that “adjusts depth and perspective” based on your position, along with a speedy 165Hz refresh rate that you can boost to 330Hz with a Dual Mode feature that switches to 3K.

The 2026 Odyssey 3D is an upgrade to the display Samsung revealed during CES last year, which comes with a smaller 27-inch display and a lower 4K resolution. We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from Asus, Dell, and LG, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like Stellar Blade, Lies of P: Overture, and The First Berserker: Khazan are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but several other titles still support its 3D effects, including Black Myth: Wukong, Hogwarts Legacy, Palworld, and Silent Hill 2.

A 6K 3D display isn’t the only notable upgrade coming to Samsung’s lineup; the company is launching the Odyssey G6 G60H, which it says is the “world’s first” 1,040Hz gaming monitor. The 27-inch monitor only supports this ultra-fast refresh rate in HD, while its native 1440p resolution still offers speeds up to a very fast 600Hz. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync.

Samsung has also revealed three new Odyssey G8 monitors, with the 32-inch G80HS offering a 6K resolution with refresh rates up to 165Hz (or 330Hz refresh rate at 3K), as well as a 27-inch 5K G80HF model with speeds up to 180Hz (or 360Hz at 1440p). There’s an Odyssey G8 with a 4K OLED display, too, featuring an up to 240Hz refresh rate, 300-nit brightness, and True Black 500 certification for deeper blacks. All three models support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync.

Samsung hasn’t yet revealed the pricing or release date of any of these models, but the Odyssey 3D is bound to be a bit pricey, given the $2,000 price tag attached to Samsung’s 4K 3D screen.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools; a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO₂—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO₂ out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO₂ is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO₂ release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO₂ is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO₂ this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan president William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” a reference to the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <h2>This company is developing gene therapies for muscle growth, erectile dysfunction, and “radical longevity”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s blood supply therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the follistatin therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons, based on previously published estimates, that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

Correction: This story was corrected to note that half of trial volunteers volunteers receive only the follistatin therapy.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
