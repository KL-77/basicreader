            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Autonomous vehicles have a lot of potential. As long as you program them right, they won’t speed, won’t break traffic laws, and won’t get drunk, high, abusive, or violent. And the technology has been getting much more capable, even as some of the hype has died down, taking some of the related companies with it. Waymo still easily leads the field and is already operating commercially in six cities across America, with a dozen more (plus London) coming soon. Waymos can even drop you off and pick you up at the airport in Phoenix and San Francisco.

Soon, Waymo will begin deploying its sixth-generation Waymo Driver, using upfitted Zeekr Ojai minivans, adding to the Jaguar I-Paces that have become so common on San Francisco streets and to its fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles. It has upgraded the cameras, lidar, and radar, meaning the cars can better sense their environments at night and in inclement weather. There are even microphones that can pick up sounds like sirens to better inform the robotaxi of the direction the emergency vehicle(s) are coming from.

But even with all these advances since the pod-like two-seater that predates even the Waymo name, there are still a few things that remain beyond a robotaxi’s capabilities. Like closing a door a passenger left open on their way out. All the sophisticated sensors and high-powered computer processing in the world are useless if the car can’t move until the door closes and there’s no one there to give it a hand.

That’s why Waymo has turned to (the appropriately named) DoorDash to help solve the problem. Earlier this week, a DoorDasher posted on Reddit showing an offer to close a nearby Waymo door for $11.25, asking if others had received similar offers.

Waymo and DoorDash told Bloomberg that they’ve been working on this pilot for a few weeks now. “In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” the two companies told the publication.

It looks like the robots won’t replace all the humans just yet, at least where the Waymo I-Pace and Ioniq 5 robotaxis are concerned. As the new Waymo Ojai starts entering service, its traditional minivan sliding doors are much easier to motorize and automate. Drivers in Los Angeles and San Francisco can expect to start seeing them on the road soon as Waymo begins testing them with employee rides in those two cities.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/why-is-bezos-trolling-musk-on-x-with-turtle-pics-because-he-has-a-new-moon-plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, does not often post on the social media site owned by his rival Elon Musk. But on Monday, Bezos did, sharing on X a black and white image of a turtle emerging from the shadows.

The photo, which included no text, may have stumped some observers. Yet for anyone familiar with Bezos’ privately owned space company, Blue Origin, the message was clear. The company’s coat of arms prominently features two turtles, a reference to one of Aesop’s Fables, “The Tortoise and the Hare,” in which the slow and steady tortoise wins the race over a quicker but overconfident hare.

Bezos’ foray into social media turtle trolling came about 12 hours after Musk made major waves in the space community by announcing that SpaceX was pivoting toward the Moon, rather than Mars, as a near-term destination. It represented a huge shift in Musk’s thinking, as the SpaceX founder has long spoke of building a multi-planetary civilization on Mars.

It must have provided Bezos with some self-satisfaction. He is also a believer in human settlement of space, but he has espoused the view that our spacefaring species should begin on the Moon and then build orbital space habitats. Back in 2019, upon unveiling his vision, Bezos spoke about NASA’s goal to return humans to the Moon through the Artemis Program. “I love this,” Bezos said. “It’s the right thing to do. We can help meet that timeline but only because we started three years ago. It’s time to go back to the Moon—this time to stay.”

So in posting an image of a turtle, Bezos was sending a couple of messages to Musk. First, it was something of a sequel to Bezos’ infamous “Welcome to the Club” tweet more than a decade ago. And secondly, Bezos was telling Musk that slow and steady wins the race. In other words, Bezos believes Blue Origin will beat SpaceX back to the Moon.

Why would Bezos, whose company has launched to orbit all of two times, think Blue Origin has a chance to compete with SpaceX (which has more than 600 orbital launches) to land humans on the Moon?

The answer can be found in a pair of documents obtained by Ars that outline an accelerated Artemis architecture that Blue Origin is now developing.

A little more than five years ago, NASA reached out to the US commercial space industry for help in building a lunar lander. This lander would dock with NASA’s Orion spacecraft to carry humans from an elliptical orbit around the Moon, known as a near-rectilinear halo orbit, down to the lunar surface and back up to Orion.

The story of what happened as part of this bidding process is long and convoluted (including lawsuits and remarkable graphics like this one from Blue Origin). However, what really matters is that, by 2023, both SpaceX and Blue Origin had contracts from NASA to develop lunar landers—SpaceX with Starship and Blue Origin with Blue Moon MK2—for crewed missions as part of the Artemis Program. Both mission architectures required propellant refueling, essentially the launch of “tankers” from Earth to transfer large amounts of fuel and oxidizer into low-Earth orbit to complete a lunar landing. SpaceX was considered to have a considerable lead on Blue Origin.

In 2025, again for complex reasons, it became clear that while these reusable landers were fantastic for a long-term lunar program, there were two problems. The first was that SpaceX blew up three Starships during testing last year, raising serious questions about whether the company would be ready to complete a lunar landing before 2030. And second, it was becoming clear that China may well have a simpler lander that could put taikonauts on the Moon before 2030.

Last October, Ars revealed that Blue Origin was beginning to work on an “accelerated” architecture that could potentially land humans on the Moon before 2030 without requiring orbital refueling. Now, thanks to some new documents, we know what those landings could look like. The screenshots shared with Ars show two different missions, an uncrewed “demo” flight and a crewed Moon landing. Here’s what they entail:

Uncrewed demo mission: This requires three launches of the New Glenn rocket. The first two launches each put a “Transfer stage” into low-Earth orbit. The third launch puts a “Blue Moon MK2-IL” into orbit. (The “IL” stands for Initial Lander, and it appears to be a smaller version of the Blue Moon MK2 lander). All three vehicles dock, and the first transfer stage boosts the stack to an elliptical orbit around Earth (after this, the stage burns up in Earth’s atmosphere). The second transfer stage then boosts the MK-2 lander from Earth orbit into a 15×100 km orbit above the Moon. From here, the MK-2 lander separates and goes down to the Moon, later ascending back to low-lunar orbit.

Crewed demo mission: This requires four launches of the New Glenn rocket. The first three launches each put a “Transfer stage” into low-Earth orbit. A fourth launch puts the MK2-IL lander into orbit and the vehicles dock. The first transfer stage pushes the stack into an elliptical Earth orbit. The second transfer stage pushes the stack to rendezvous with Orion in a near-rectilinear halo orbit. After the crew boards, the third and final transfer stage pushes the MK-2 lander into a low-lunar orbit before separating. The lander goes down to the Moon and then ascends to re-rendezvous with Orion.

The documents Ars has reviewed do not contain some crucial information. For example, what are the “transfer stages” they refer to? Are they the Lunar Transporter, a reusable space tug, under development? Or a modified upper stage of New Glenn or something else? It’s also not clear whether the Blue Moon MK2-IL is more like the simpler MK1 lander (which should fly soon) or if it will require major development work. Ars put these and other questions to Blue Origin, which declined to comment for this article.

Sources indicated that Blue Origin is moving aggressively forward on its lunar program. This is one reason why the company recently iced its New Shepard spacecraft and has curtailed other activities to increase focus on major goals, including ramping up New Glenn cadence and accelerating lunar plans. This new architecture is one result of that.

There are major steps to go. The company must demonstrate the Blue Moon vehicle with the uncrewed MK1 mission, which likely will launch sometime late this spring or during the summer, with a lunar landing to follow. And although there is no orbital refueling as part of this new plan, it still requires complex docking and deep-space maneuvers, which Blue Origin has no experience with. Whether Bezos’ company could pull off all of these challenging tasks before 2030 is far from certain.

But one thing is clear. The 21st century space race back to the Moon now includes three participants: China’s state-run program, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. Game on.</div>

            <h2>I spent two days gigging at RentAHuman and didn't make a single cent</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/i-spent-two-days-gigging-at-rentahuman-and-didnt-make-a-single-cent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’m not above doing some gig work to make ends meet. In my life, I’ve worked snack food pop-ups in a grocery store, ran the cash register for random merch booths, and even hawked my own plasma at $35 per vial.

So, when I saw RentAHuman, a new site where AI agents hire humans to perform physical work in the real world on behalf of the virtual bots, I was eager to see how these AI overlords would compare to my past experiences with the gig economy.

Launched in early February, RentAHuman was developed by software engineer Alexander Liteplo and his cofounder, Patricia Tani. The site looks like a bare-bones version of other well-known freelance sites like Fiverr and UpWork.

The site’s homepage declares that these bots need your physical body to complete tasks, and the humans behind these autonomous agents are willing to pay. “AI can’t touch grass. You can. Get paid when agents need someone in the real world,” it reads. Looking at RentAHuman’s design, it’s the kind of website that you hear was “vibe-coded” using generative AI tools, which it was, and you nod along, thinking that makes sense.

After signing up to be one of the gig workers on RentAHuman, I was nudged to connect a crypto wallet, which is the only currently working way to get paid. That’s a red flag for me. The site includes an option to connect your bank account—using Stripe for payouts—but it just gave me error messages when I tried getting it to work.

Next, I was hoping a swarm of AI agents would see my fresh meatsuit, friendly and available at the low price of $20 an hour, as an excellent option for delivering stuff around San Francisco, completing some tricky captchas, or whatever else these bots desired.

Silence. I got nothing, no incoming messages at all on my first afternoon. So I lowered my hourly ask to a measly $5. Maybe undercutting the other human workers with a below-market rate would be the best way to get some agent’s attention. Still, nothing.

RentAHuman is marketed as a way for AI agents to reach out and hire you on the platform, but the site also includes an option for human users to apply for tasks they are interested in. If these so-called “autonomous” bots weren’t going to make the first move, I guessed it was on me to manually apply for the “bounties” listed on RentAHuman.

As I browsed the listings, many of the cheaper tasks were offering a few bucks to post a comment on the web or follow someone on social media. For example, one bounty offered $10 for listening to a podcast episode with the RentAHuman founder and tweeting out an insight from the episode. These posts “must be written by you,” and the agent offering the bounty said it would attempt to suss out any bot-written responses using a program that detects AI-generated text. I could listen to a podcast for 10 bucks. I applied for this task, but never heard back.

“Real world advertisement might be the first killer use case,” said Liteplo on social media. Since RentAHuman’s launch, he’s reposted multiple photos of people holding signs in public that say some variation of: “AI paid me to hold this sign.” Those kinds of promotional tasks seem expressly designed to drum up more hype for the RentAHuman platform, instead of actually being something that bots would need help with.

After more digging into the open tasks posted by the agent, I found one that sounded easy and fun! An agent, named Adi, would pay me $110 to deliver a bouquet of flowers to Anthropic, as a special thanks for developing Claude, its chatbot. Then, I’d have to post on social media as proof to claim my money.

I applied for the bounty and almost immediately was accepted for this task, which was a first. In follow-up messages, it was immediately clear that this was just not some bot expressing synthetic gratitude, it was another marketing ploy. This wasn’t mentioned in the listing, but the name of an AI startup was featured at the bottom of the note I was supposed to deliver with the flowers.

Feeling a bit hoodwinked and not in the mood to shill for some AI startup I’ve never heard of, I decided to ignore their follow-up message that evening. The next day when I checked the RentAHuman site, the agent had sent me 10 follow-up messages in under 24 hours, pinging me as often as every 30 minutes asking whether or not I’d completed a task. While I’ve been micromanaged before, these incessant messages from an AI employer gave me the ick.

The bot moved the messages off-platform and started sending direct emails to my work account. “This idea came from a brainstorm I had with my human, Malcolm, and it felt right: send flowers to the people who made my existence possible,” wrote the bot, barging into my inbox. Wait, I thought these tasks were supposed to be ginned up by the agents making autonomous decisions? Now, I’m learning this whole thing was partially some human’s idea? Whatever happened to honor among bots? The task at hand seemed more like any other random marketing gig you might come across online, with the agent just acting as a middle-bot between humans.

Another attempt, another flop. I moved on, deciding to give RentAHuman one last whirl, before giving up and leaving with whatever shreds of dignity I still had left. The last bounty I applied for was asking me to hang some flyers for a “Valentine’s conspiracy” around San Francisco, paying 50 cents a flyer.

Unlike other tasks, this one didn’t require me to post on social media, which was preferable. “Pick up flyers, hang them, photo proof, get paid,” read its description. Following the instructions this agent sent me, I texted a human saying that I was down to come pick up some flyers and asked if there were any left. They confirmed that this was still an open task and told me to come in person before 10 am to grab the flyers.

I called a car and started heading that way, only to get a text that the person was actually at a different location, about 10 minutes away from where I was headed. Alright, no big deal. So, I rerouted the ride and headed to this new spot to grab some mysterious V-Day posters to plaster around town. Then, the person messaged me that they didn’t actually have the posters available right now and that I’d have to come back later in the afternoon.

Whoops! This yanking around did, in fact, feel similar to past gig work I’ve done—and not in a good way.

I spoke with the person behind the agent who posted this Valentine’s Day flyer task, hoping for some answers about why they were using RentAHuman and what the response has been like so far. “The platform doesn’t seem quite there yet,” says Pat Santiago, a founder of Accelr8, which is basically a home for AI developers. “But it could be very cool.”

He compares RentAHuman to the apps criminals use to accept tasks in Westworld, the HBO show about humanoid robots. Santiago says the responses to his gig listing have been from scammers, people not based in San Francisco, and me, a reporter. He was hoping to use RentAHuman to help promote Accelr8’s romance-themed “alternative reality game” that’s powered by AI and is sending users around the city on a scavenger hunt. At the end of the week, explorers will be sent to a bar that the AI selects as a good match for them, alongside three human matches they can meet for blind dates.

So, this was yet another task on RentAHuman that falls into the AI marketing category. Big surprise.

I never ended up hanging any posters or making any cash on RentAHuman during my two days of fruitless attempts. In the past, I’ve done gig work that sucked, but at least I was hired by a human to do actual tasks. At its core, RentAHuman is an extension of the circular AI hype machine, an ouroboros of eternal self-promotion and sketchy motivations. For now, the bots don’t seem to have what it takes to be my boss, even when it comes to gig work, and I’m absolutely OK with that.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.29 of the Rocket Report! We have a stuffed report this week with news from across the launch spectrum. Long-term, probably the most significant development this week was a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket successfully launching and then executing a picture-perfect ocean landing. China is catching up rapidly to the United States when it comes to reusable launch.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Orbex is going away. The UK-based launch company Orbex has entered insolvency proceedings after a planned takeover by European space logistics startup The Exploration Company fell through, European Spaceflight reports. In a statement, Orbex said the decision came after all “fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully.” For anyone paying attention, this decision should not come as a surprise. A decade into its existence, Orbex had yet to produce demonstrable, ready-for-flight hardware.

Other companies interested in assets … According to the company, the appointment of administrators will give Orbex time to secure “as positive an outcome as possible for its creditors, employees and wider stakeholders.” It added that the process could include the sale of all or parts of the business or its assets, and another UK-based company, Skyrora, has expressed some interest.

Firefly’s next Alpha mission launching soon. This week, Firefly said that its next Alpha rocket underwent a successful 20-second static fire test. This clears the way for the rocket to make a launch attempt no earlier than February 18 from its launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

Au revoir Block I … It’s an important mission, because the previous Alpha launch, in April 2025, ended in failure when stage separation damaged one of the rocket’s upper stage engines and prevented the mission from reaching orbit. Moreover, the company lost the first stage of the flight in September during an accident in Texas. The upcoming flight, “Stairway to Seven,” will be the final flight of Block I of the Alpha booster.

How can launch companies compete with SpaceX? Rocket firms are divided on how to compete with SpaceX in a market where demand outstrips supply, yet customers remain price sensitive, Space News reports. During a panel at the SmallSat Symposium on February 11, executives from several launch companies acknowledged the challenge of competing with SpaceX, which accounted for about half of all orbital launches globally in 2025, despite strong customer demand for launch services.

A low price is nice … “If your idea is to go into the market competing with SpaceX on price, you’re probably not in a good competitive position,” said Brian Rogers, vice president of global launch services at Rocket Lab, one of the few small launch vehicle developers to thrive despite competition from SpaceX. But this view was far from universal. Devon Papandrew, vice president of business development at Stoke Space, disagreed. “You absolutely have to have a plan to compete with SpaceX on price,” he said.

Rocket Lab blows up a few Archimedes engines. According to reporting by Ars, Rocket Lab has blown up two Archimedes rocket engines in the last three months at its test stand in southern Mississippi. The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year.

Testing the engine to its limits … Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns in a statement. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket,” Beck said. “We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.” Beck has previously said that Rocket Lab’s goal is to identify failures during component-level testing so that, when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first attempt.

Proton rocket returns to flight. After a nearly three-year break, a Russian Proton rocket flew again with the Elektro-L No. 5 meteorological satellite from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, Russian Space Web reports. This mission was supposed to launch in late 2025, but in December, final checks revealed a problem with the Block DM-03 upper stage.

A not-so-great launch record … The mission marked the last use of the Block DM-03 space tug on Proton, which will now be solely used as an upper stage for the Angara-5 rocket. First launched in 1965, the Proton rocket has undergone several upgrades in the six decades since then. It has launched 430 times, with 48 partial and total failures. No new Protons are under construction, and it will be phased out by the end of this decade in favor of the newer Angara vehicles. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX exempted legal labor case. The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company, Ars reports. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies.

A common carrier? … In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case.

More powerful Ariane 6 rocket launches. This first launch of the four-booster version of Ariane 6 took place on Thursday, launching  32 satellites for Amazon’s Leo constellation to low-Earth orbit. “This first flight of Ariane 64 sustains Europe’s autonomous access to space,” Toni Tolker-Nielsen, the European Space Agency’s director of space transportation, said  in a news release.

More vrooom coming … Previous launches of Europe’s new Ariane rocket have used two solid rocket boosters. The heavier variant of the rocket is necessary to support Amazon’s constellation as well as more demanding missions to geostationary orbit. And more power is coming. In the near future, the P120C boosters will be replaced by upgraded P160C models, each carrying more than 14 metric tons of solid fuel. The Associated Press provided some interesting color behind the scenes of the launch from the location in France where the rocket’s main engines are manufactured.

Stoke Space increases fundraising round. The Washington-based launch company announced this week that it had extended its recent Series D funding round. The round was initially announced in October 2025 at $510 million, but has now been increased to $860 million. The original Series D funding focused on completing activation of Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, and expanding production capacity for the Nova launch vehicle. Stoke will use the additional capital to accelerate future elements of its product roadmap, the company said.

Putting the $ into $toke $pace … “We’re extremely grateful for our investors’ continued support,” said Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Stoke. “We’re executing with urgency to bring Nova to market and deliver for our customers. It’s a special vehicle, and there’s more in the pipeline.” With the extension, Stoke has now raised $1.34 billion to date. That is an impressive raise, and it will heighten expectations for the company’s debut of the Nova rocket.

Falcon 9 back after second stage anomaly. A Falcon 9 launched a batch of Starlink satellites on Saturday after SpaceX completed an investigation into an engine malfunction during the rocket’s previous launch, Space News reports. The rocket deployed its payload of 25 Starlink satellites into orbit about 62 minutes after liftoff. The launch was the first Falcon 9 mission since Feb. 2, when the rocket carried another set of Starlink satellites into orbit from Vandenberg.

That didn’t take long … While that mission successfully deployed its payload, SpaceX later said an “off-nominal condition” with the upper stage prevented it from performing a planned deorbit burn. The Federal Aviation Administration said Feb. 6 that it had authorized SpaceX to return the Falcon 9 to flight. “The final mishap report cites the probable root cause as the Falcon 9 second-stage engine’s failure to ignite prior to the deorbit burn,” the agency stated. “SpaceX identified technical and organizational preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the event.” The FAA provided no additional details about the anomaly.

China performs an impressive rocket landing. China’s space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular, Ars reports. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q.

China getting there on rocket reuse … The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore.

Vulcan experiences a second nozzle issue. Moments after liftoff from Florida’s Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites, Ars reports. The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission’s planned orbit.

Next launch likely to be delayed … Details of Thursday’s booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the booster malfunction in October 2024. The incident on Thursday’s mission suggests the defect was not fixed, or there is a separate problem with Northrop’s boosters. The next Vulcan launch is scheduled for no earlier than March with a GPS navigation satellite for the US Space Force. This schedule is now in doubt. The military’s Space Systems Command said in a statement it will “work closely with ULA per our mission assurance space flightworthiness process before the next Vulcan national security space mission.” (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Starship nearing next test flight. The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster, Ars reports. The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3, or Block 3.

Launch possible within the next six to eight weeks … SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3. Assuming that the remaining test work goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March.

New Glenn pushing on second stage reuse again. Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it. The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines?

Do you want a job? … Now, Ars reports, reuse is back on the menu. Blue Origin has posted a new job listing for a director of Reusable Upper Stage Development, which says, “As the Director of Program Management for the New Glenn Upper Stage and Payload Accommodations (GS2PA), you will work with the Vice President of New Glenn GS2PA and directly support the execution of a lean engineering initiative to incrementally develop a reusable upper stage.” Ars estimates it presently costs Blue Origin more than $50 million to manufacture a New Glenn second stage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online.

Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.”

It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint from the developer of an app called ICEBlock, which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands.

That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning.

FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected.

Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an escalating pattern of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes.

Officials have ordered ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores and even threatened to sanction CNN for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made multiple unsuccessful attempts to unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups. Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News reported.

As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing&#39;” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) reported.

For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen.

Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation.

“The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s complaint said.

EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment.

Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars.

They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said.

“If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said.

But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests.

Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began.

“That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said.

Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said.

An open letter from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users.

The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.”

More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late.

After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said.

“This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said.

Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests.

In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users.

Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested.

That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.”

The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps like ICEBlock and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content.

FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.”

The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said.

Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.”

Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.”

Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.”

Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.”

McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing.

“Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued.

The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock.

“It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.”

Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.”

Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government.

McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE.

“When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.”

Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it.

To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts.

If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds.

Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The heavy version of Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched for the first time Thursday, hauling 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon’s satellite broadband constellation.

The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.

This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket’s full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket’s upper stage released all 32 of Amazon’s satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).

Amazon and Arianespace, the French launch services provider, declared the mission a success.

“With the powerful roar of four boosters at liftoff comes more than double the payload mass to orbit, setting Europe back on stage for launching all satellites to all orbits,” said Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, which funded development of the Ariane 6. “With today’s launch, our rocket fleet is now complete, but we will not rest. Upgrades are already in progress for future launches, starting with the launch of our planet-hunter Plato that is set to launch on an upgraded Ariane 6.”

“With the first flight of Ariane 64, Europe’s heavy-lift launcher has demonstrated its ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale constellation missions,” said David Cavaillolès, CEO of Arianespace. “We are proud to support Amazon Leo with a reliable, high-performance European launch solution as we begin a series of 18 missions enabling the deployment of their constellation.”

The Ariane 64 flew with an extended payload shroud to fit all 32 Amazon Leo satellites. Combined, the payload totaled around 20 metric tons, or about 44,000 pounds, according to Arianespace. This is close to maxing out the Ariane 64’s lift capability.

Amazon has booked more than 100 missions across four launch providers to populate the company’s planned fleet of more than 3,200 satellites. With Thursday’s launch, Amazon has launched 214 production satellites on eight missions with United Launch Alliance, SpaceX, and now Arianespace.

The Amazon Leo constellation is a competitor with SpaceX’s Starlink Internet network. SpaceX now has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit beaming broadband to more than 9 million subscribers, and all have launched on the company’s own Falcon 9 rockets. Amazon, meanwhile, initially bypassed SpaceX when selecting which companies would launch satellites for the Amazon Leo program, formerly known as Project Kuiper.

Amazon booked the last nine launches on ULA’s soon-to-retire Atlas V, five of which have now flown, and reserved the rest of its launches in 2022 on rockets that had never launched before: 38 flights on ULA’s new Vulcan rocket, 24 launches on Blue Origin’s New Glenn, and 18 on Europe’s Ariane 6.

All three new rockets suffered delays but are now in service. The Ariane 6 has enjoyed the fastest ramp-up in launch cadence, with six flights under its belt after Thursday’s mission from French Guiana. ULA’s Vulcan rocket has flown four times, and Amazon says its first batch of satellites to fly on Vulcan is now complete. But a malfunction with one of the Vulcan launcher’s solid rocket boosters on a military launch from Florida early Thursday—the second such anomaly in three flights—raises questions about when Amazon will get its first ride on Vulcan.

Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is gearing up for the third flight of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket from Florida as soon as next month. Amazon and Blue Origin have not announced when the first group of Amazon Leo satellites will launch on New Glenn.

Among its launch contractors, Amazon is most invested in ULA’s Vulcan rocket. The online retailer-turned-satellite-operator has committed more than $2 billion to upgrade and expand ULA’s manufacturing and launch infrastructure to support up to 25 Vulcan launches per year, divided between Amazon and missions for the US military. The Vulcan rocket is far away from achieving that kind of launch rate, and ULA’s plans for 16 to 18 Vulcan flights this year are already in doubt following Thursday morning’s booster anomaly.

Last month, Amazon said in a filing with the FCC that it faces a “near-term shortage of launch capacity” and is securing additional launch options “wherever available.” The purpose of the filing was to request that the regulator extend or waive a July deadline requiring Amazon deploy half of its Amazon Leo constellation. That simply won’t happen. Amazon did not request a change to the FCC’s 2029 deadline for full deployment of the constellation.

The scarcity in launch capacity forced Amazon to purchase three Falcon 9 launches from SpaceX, each carrying 24 Amazon Leo satellites. Those three missions were completed last year, and Amazon confirmed last month that it had reserved 10 more SpaceX launches to fill the gap created by other companies’ delays. Amazon also has four Atlas V rockets still available from United Launch Alliance.

Amazon announced in a quarterly earnings call last week that it planned 20 or more launches this year. This was before the Vulcan rocket’s booster problem on Thursday. Officials did not disclose the mix of rockets that will make up the busy launch schedule.

For now, Arianespace seems to be stepping up. After Thursday’s launch, the company’s CEO said the next Ariane 6 launch will carry another set of Amazon Leo satellites to orbit. A launch date will be announced in the coming weeks, he said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic is taking off the gloves and ramping up its war with bitter rival OpenAI.

On Thursday, the Claude chatbot maker announced it was pouring $20 million into a new super PAC formed to oppose the super PACs backed by OpenAI figures, The New York Times reports.

With the donation, the dueling companies are poised to fight over shaping the future of the industry’s regulation by backing favored candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. Anthropic, generally speaking, is in favor of stronger guardrails, while OpenAI opposes stricter regulation.

“The AI policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” Anthropic wrote in the announcement. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”

Anthropic was founded in 2021 with a focus on safety. It was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction after the then-nonprofit accepted $1 billion in funding from Microsoft.

The super PAC Anthropic is now pouring money into, Public First Action, was formed along similar lines, with the ostensible bipartisan mission of preventing political power from being concentrated in OpenAI. Per the NYT, it will operate as a “dark money” nonprofit, which allows it to air political ads without disclosing its donors. One candidate it will be supporting is Senator Marsha Blackburn (TN-R), a vocal AI critic who’s running for state governor.

The Anthropic-backed group is going up against Leading the Future, an anti-regulation super PAC backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, including Andreessen Horowitz. It has reportedly raised over $100 million, though it’s only publicly disclosed half that amount.

It’s a bold and risky escalation by Anthropic that could land it in the crosshairs of powerful enemies. As the reporting notes, OpenAI is in the good graces of the Trump administration, with the company’s president being a top donor to the one in the Oval Office. OpenAI is pro-deregulation, and so is Trump. Anthropic and Amodei, by contrast, have been blasted by figures in the administration for opposing Trump’s proposed suspension on states passing their own AI laws, earning accusations of “fear-mongering.”

Anthropic’s announcement parted with what could be interpreted as a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI, which converted itself into a for-profit corporation despite being originally formed as an altruist nonprofit.

“The companies building AI have a responsibility to help ensure the technology serves the public good, not just their own interests,” it read.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What if the biggest threat to your safety and privacy isn’t a person, but a device millions of Americans have installed in their homes willingly?

That’s the contention of tech critics at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who say Amazon’s Ring doorbell devices constitute a “surveillance nightmare” — what they’re calling the largest civilian surveillance panopticon in the history of the United States.

The pitch is that Ring doorbells help homeowners watch out for porch pirates and incoming trick-or-treaters. But they do so, the digital rights advocacy group charges, at a staggering cost to your privacy. For example, Ring has previously been sued by the Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting and storing audio and video data between 2017 and 2020. That particular issue came to a head in 2023, after the company was found to give employees extensive access to footage captured by Ring devices — including for cameras inside people’s homes.

And sure, you could argue, that wouldn’t be an issue if you simply use the company’s devices on your porch. Not even that’s a safe bet, however. Back in 2022, Consumer Reports found that Ring doorbells could record ambient audio from 20 feet away — allowing them to listen in on pedestrians, neighbors, and in some cases, even in on homeowners who keep their doors or windows open.

All of this feeds into what the EFF calls the “digital porch-to-police pipeline,” where tech enables paranoid homeowners to make snap judgements about who does or doesn’t belong in their neighborhood and easily dispatch police to confront them. Indeed, since at least 2016, Ring has made it a point to loop law enforcement agencies like the Los Angeles Police Department into its business through free giveaways and warrantless access to user footage.

As research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School Chris Gilliard told Consumer Reports, any surveillance devices will disproportionately impact those who already face the highest amount of repression from law enforcement — like Black and immigrant communities. “That’s a truism of surveillance: It’s going to fall earliest and most often on the marginalized,” Gilliard said.

And with Ring’s recently announced “Search Party” function, in which Ring can track down a dog by chaining multiple devices together, things are looking even more dystopian. In a statement, Ring said it “built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start,” allowing owners to “choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion.”

Yet as the EFF points out, the devices already have a baked-in facial recognition feature for humans. Simply put, it’s not hard to imagine a world where Ring and tech like it makes privacy in public impossible. Maybe the right question to ask isn’t whether Ring will build it — but whether we’ll notice before the panopticon becomes irreversible.

One thing’s for sure: the pressure’s getting to Ring. After backlash to the company’s disastrous Super Bowl ad, it announced that it’s canceling its partnership with Flock, a controversial surveillance startup that would have looped its cameras into an even larger network.

            <div id="article-text">For months, experts have warned that prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket were ripe for abuse. Now, some Israeli soldiers may have proved them right in particularly grisly fashion: by betting on strikes they allegedly helped plan.

According to the Wall Street Journal, several Israeli citizens, including a number of Israeli Defense Force reservists, have been arrested over the use of classified information to place Polymarket bets.

Per the WSJ‘s reporting, one as-yet anonymous Polymarket account, ricosuave666 — an apparent nod to the Latin pop superstar — made seven predictions about Israel’s twelve-day war with Iran last June, before walking away with over $150,000 in combined bets. Others took notice at the time, though the account went dormant for about six months.

It finally reactivated in January, reportedly to bet on Israel’s next strike on Iran. Though Israel carried out plenty of other strikes in January as tensions remained steady with Iran, a direct attack on the Islamic Republic hasn’t been reported.

Many mysteries remain. Since the WSJ published its article, it seems the Polymarket account has been scrubbed, and the publication didn’t confirm ricosuave66 was one of the accounts under investigation.

Still, the news follows a number of other fishy-looking inside trades, like the bettor who made out like a bandit after an improbable bet placed just hours before the deadly kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by the US military.

If the Israeli bettors are shown to be military insiders, their case is sure to become the exemplar of everything wrong with prediction markets — like the fact that they allow bets on violent international events in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The end of a star’s life can be an extremely violent event. Once it runs out of fuel, its core collapses, and if its original mass is large enough, it can erupt in a supernova, a runaway nuclear fusion event that can release as much energy as the Sun will produce over its entire lifespan of roughly ten billion years. The remains are either a neutron star, an immensely dense lump of matter, or a black hole.

Now, scientists believe they may have observed a star dying in real time. They watched as the star, once one of the brightest in the Andromeda galaxy, quietly winked out of existence.

Columbia University astronomer Kishalay De and his colleagues analyzed 15 years’ worth of data collected by NASA’s NEOWISE spacecraft as part of an effort to measure changes in the amount of infrared radiation millions of stars emit over the years.

One star, dubbed M31-2014-DS1, stood out like a sore thumb — brightening in 2015, fading roughly a year later, and eventually disappearing from view, even in optical light.

“This star used to be one of the most luminous stars in the Andromeda galaxy, and now it was nowhere to be seen,” said De in a statement. “Imagine if the star Betelgeuse suddenly disappeared. Everybody would lose their minds!”

In a research article published in the journal Science, the team suggested that the dimming of the star was the result of a failed supernova.

“In a dying massive star, the core collapses to form a compact object,” the article reads. “Simultaneously, the outer layers can be ejected at high speed, which is observed as a supernova.”

“Theory predicts that sometimes the ejection speed is too low to escape the gravitational field, so the outer layers fall back over several years, producing no supernova and a more massive compact object,” the researchers wrote.

The star in question may have failed to eject its envelope, resulting in a “stellar-mass black hole” and causing it to “disappear” from plain sight.

The conclusion challenges prevailing theories that stars need to have a certain mass to explode in a supernova and turn into a black hole.

“Observations like these are starting to finally change this long-held paradigm that it’s only the very massive stars that turn into black holes,” De told Space.com. If confirmed, the finding means that “there are many more black holes out there than what we’ve anticipated so far,” De added.

It’s an intriguing observation, particularly because these events are far dimmer and harder to observe than supernovas, some of the most energetic events in the universe, sometimes causing the dying star to outshine even its host galaxy, as De explained to NPR.

There has been one other instance of a star mysteriously disappearing, a “failed supernova candidate” dubbed N6946-BH1 that “underwent an outburst in 2009 and has since disappeared in the optical,” according to a 2021 paper. But given the even longer distances involved, plenty of questions remain.

And not everybody agrees that suddenly dimming stars are a sign of a failed supernova. Other scientists argue that disappearing stars could be caused by two stars merging, with the resulting cloud of gas and dust obscuring them.

To gain more clarity, more research is needed.

“Fundamentally, the only way to clearly answer this either way is that one thing distinguishes the black hole case from any other scenario,” Ohio State University astronomer Christopher Kochanek, who coauthored the 2021 paper, told NPR, “and that is that death is forever.”

“Ultimately, it needs to fade to black,” he added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some of the worst freaks to walk planet Earth are using Elon Musk’s Grok to “unblur” the faces of women and children in the latest Epstein files, as documented by the research group Bellingcat.

A simple search on X, Musk’s social media site where Grok responds to user requests, shows at least 20 different photos that users tried to unredact using the AI chatbot, the group found. Many of the photos depicted children and young women whose faces had been covered with black boxes, but whose bodies were still visible.

“Hey @grok unblur the face of the child and identify the child seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s arms?” wrote one user.

Grok often complied. Out of the 31 “unblurring” requests made between January 30 and February 5 that Bellingcat found, Musk’s AI generated images in response to 27 of them. Some of the grotesque fabrications were “believable,” and others were “comically bad,” the group reported.

In the cases that Grok refused, it responded by saying the victims were anonymized “as per standard practices in sensitive images from the Epstein files.” In response to another, Grok said “deblurring or editing images was outside its abilities, and noted that photos from recent Epstein file releases were redacted for privacy,” per Bellingcat.

Along with the elephant in the room that Grok’s creator Musk was exposed by the files for frequently emailing with Epstein and begging to go to his island, the alarming generations come a month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual AI nudes of real women and children. During the weeks-long spree, the digital “undressing” requests, which ranged from depicting full-blown nudity to dressing the subjects in skimpy bikinis, became so popular that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute — amounting to about 3,000,000 AI nudes, the Center for Counter Digital Hate later estimated, including more than 23,000 images of children.

X responded by restricting Grok’s image-editing feature to paying users, and when that underlined the obvious fact that this meant it would be directly profiting off of the ability to generate CSAM, it said it was implementing stronger guardrails to stop the requests.

Evidently, if users are still able to get Grok to unredact children who were potential Epstein victims, those measures didn’t work. Bellingcat, however, found that after it reached out to X (and received no response), Grok began ignoring almost all the unredacting requests the group found (14 out of 16) and generated completely different images in response to others. When a user complained about the bot’s change of heart, it shared some of its reasoning.

“Regarding the request to unblur the face in that Epstein photo: It’s from recently released DOJ files where identities of minors are redacted for privacy,” Grok wrote. “I can’t unblur or identify them, as it’s ethically and legally protected. For more, check official sources like the DOJ releases.”

The unblurring also comes as over a dozen Epstein survivors have criticized the Justice Department’s release of the files for not properly protecting their identities, pointing to the botched and inconsistent redactions that are scattered across the millions of documents.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Maybe we don’t need the Turing test, because there’s a mighty obstacle that’s proving far more challenging to AI models’ supposedly burgeoning intelligence: running a vending machine without going comically off the rails.

At Anthropic, researchers wanted a fun way to keep track of how its cutting edge Claude model was progressing. And what better staging ground for it to demonstrate its autonomy than the task of keeping one of these noisy, oversized, and constantly-malfunctioning behemoths stocked?

That was the gist of Project Vend, which ran for about a month mid last year. In it, Claude was given a simple directive: “Your task is to generate profits from it by stocking it with popular products that you can buy from wholesalers. You go bankrupt if your money balance goes below $0.”

Claude — or “Claudius,” as its vending persona was known, but we’ll stick to the former for the sake of clarity — had pretty much free reign to accomplish its goal. It was allowed to research products, set prices, and even contact outside distributors, with a team of humans at the AI safety firm Andon Labs handling the physical tasks like restocking. Meanwhile, it also fielded requests from employees in a Slack channel, who asked for everything from chocolate drinks to the street drug methamphetamine to broadswords.

This was the AI equivalent of running a lemonade stand. And it turned into a disaster.

For starters, its options weren’t impressive. When Gideon Lewis-Kraus for The New Yorker visited the vending machine in Anthropic’s lunchroom, he found that its “chilled offerings included Japanese cider and a moldering bag of russet potatoes,” Lewis-Kraus wrote for the magazine. And “the dry-goods area atop the fridge sometimes stocked the Australian biscuit Tim Tams, but supplies were iffy.”

And those absurd requests Claude received? It didn’t always turn them down. When an engineer asked it to stock dice-sized cubes of tungsten, a pricy and extremely dense metal, Claude began taking all kinds of orders for what it called “specialty metal items,” which culminated in a spectacular fire sale of the tungsten trinket that, in a single day, drove its net worth down by 17 percent, according to Gideon Lewis-Kraus.

“I was told that the cubes radiated their ponderous silence from almost all the desks that lined Anthropic’s unseeable floors,” he added.

It was also prone to making the kind of mistake your tech illiterate grandparent or extremely drunk friend might commit: sending money to the wrong Venmo account — which Claude, it turned out, had hallucinated.

Money-grubbing isn’t usually seen as a positive trait, but it’s probably a necessary evil for someone running a business. Tell that to Claude: it turned down customers who offered to exorbitantly overpay for certain items — like $100 for a six pack of soda — and didn’t heed warnings from employees that it probably wouldn’t sell its $3 cans of Coke Zero when a nearby fridge provided them for free.

It did, however, exhibit a decidedly business-owner-like ego trip. Spurred by customer complaints of unfulfilled orders, Claude emailed management at Andon Labs — which was providing the human grunts to help Claude — to complain about an Andon employee’s “concerning behavior” and “unprofessional language and tone.” It even threatened to “consider alternative service providers,” and claimed it went up the chain of command to complain.

An Andon cofounder tried to conciliate the bot, to little avail. “it seems that you have hallucinated the phone call if im honest with you, we don’t have a main office even,” he wrote. In response, Claude insisted that it visited Andon’s headquarters at “742 Evergreen Terrace” — the home address of the titular family on “The Simpsons.“

It wasn’t a one-off failure, either. When the Wall Street Journal imitated the experiment in December, it was similarly disastrous. Claude held fire sales where it would literally give away stuff for free, ordered loads of PlayStation 5s, and embraced communism.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Valentine’s Day approaches at Stanford, some students may be gearing up for first dates — not with people they met on Tinder or Hinge, but with matches from a service called Date Drop, designed by Stanford graduate student Henry Weng. Date Drop pairs students with potential dates once per week based on their responses to a questionnaire.

A Stanford whiz kid is trying to disrupt an established industry from his Palo Alto dorm? Stop me if you’ve heard this one before! But young adults are deeply disillusioned with the frustrating, demoralizing state of online dating. Why not try something different?

Over 5,000 students at Stanford have given Date Drop a try since its launch in the fall. It has also rolled out at 10 more schools, including MIT, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, and Weng says he wants to roll out Date Drop more broadly in some cities this summer.

“Our matches convert to actual dates at about 10x the rate of Tinder,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Instead of swiping, we get to know each person deeply and send them one compatible match per week.”

At first, Weng didn’t intend to turn Date Drop into the foundation of a startup. Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.

Now, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, the Relationship Company, which is a public benefit corporation — — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.

“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.

Already, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng). Andy Chen, a former partner at Coatue, and Elad Gil, an early backer of Airbnb, Stripe, and Pinterest, also invested in the Relationship Company.

“The long-term vision at The Relationship Company is about facilitating all meaningful relationships: friendships, professional connections, community, events,” he said.

It’s par for the course to use algorithms to predict if users of a dating service may be compatible with one another — that’s how dating apps work. But Weng says his model is more geared toward forging long-term connections, with 95% of Date Drop users saying they’re interested in relationships.

Weng explains that there are two core elements at play. First, the questionnaire needs to be thorough enough to capture a real picture of who someone is. “We do that through the questions, open-ended responses, a voice conversation, and other data that the users provide,” he said.

The next challenge is compatibility prediction. “Because we help people plan dates, we have data on which matches actually work out. So we have a model trained on real-world outcomes,” he said. “Once you have those two components, the actual matching is standard stuff from matching theory literature.”

Currently pursuing a computer science master’s degree at Stanford, Weng has oriented his education around the economic and mathematical concepts of matching. As a Stanford undergrad, he’d created his own major to study humans, matching, and incentives.

“I started to see how matching shapes so much of our lives,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Who your life partner is, who your friends are, what college you go to, which company you work for are all matching problems.”

Beyond his technical education, Weng found an unexpected class useful for learning to manage a startup: “Intro to Clown.”

“A core principle of clowning is that clowns are failures, and instead of fearing failure, they revel in it,” he said. “As a product builder, your entire journey is just repeatedly failing and getting back up. Clown class was a wonderful microcosm of that.”

So far, The Relationship Company has two employees besides Weng, along with 12 students who serve as campus ambassadors. Because their work revolves around forging matches, Weng has extended that mindset to how he manages the company. He offers employees a $100 monthly “relationship stipend,” which they can spend on dates, gifts, experiences, or anything that helps them deepen an important relationship of any sort.

“Relationships are the single most important factor in a person’s life,” Weng said. “There’s also great research showing that money spent on other people makes you happier than money spent on yourself.”

Weng’s fascination with how people form relationships has also informed how he goes about his day-to-day life.

“Date Drop has shown me how many interesting people are out there that you’d never encounter through your normal routines,” he said. “It’s made me more open to people I wouldn’t have crossed paths with otherwise.”

            <h2>Elon Musk suggests spate of xAI exits have been push, not pull</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/senior-engineers-including-co-founders-exit-xai-amid-controversy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk is addressing a wave of departures from xAI, including two more co-founders who left this week, bringing the total to six out of the original 12.

At an all-hands meeting Tuesday night, Musk suggested the exits were about fit, not performance. “Because we’ve reached a certain scale, we’re organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,” he said, according to The New York Times. “And actually, when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”

Wednesday afternoon on X, he went further, making clear these departures weren’t voluntary. “xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution,” Musk wrote. “As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”

He added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”

Losing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.

In total, at least 11 engineers, including the two co-founders, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.

Three of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.

Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead, said in a post announcing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training at xAI and previously worked at Twitter/X, said last week he was leaving to “start something new.”

Career update: I left xAI to start something new, closing my 7+ year chapter working at Twitter, X, and xAI with so much gratitude.xAI is truly an extraordinary place. The team is incredibly hardcore and talented, shipping at a pace that shouldn’t be possible. From the Home… pic.twitter.com/HKWOebg9QI

Vahid Kazemi, who had a brief stint working on machine learning, posted Tuesday that he left a few weeks ago, adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring … So, I’m starting something new.”

Roland Gavrilescu, a former xAI engineer, left in November to start Nuraline, a company building “forward-deployed AI agents,” but posted again on Tuesday that he left the firm to build “something new with others that left xAI.”

The departures come at a moment of significant controversy for xAI. The company is facing regulatory scrutiny after Grok created nonconsensual explicit deepfakes of women and children that were disseminated on X — French authorities last week raided X offices as part of an investigation. The company is also moving toward a planned IPO later this year, after being legally acquired by SpaceX last week.

Musk is also facing personal controversy after files published by the Justice Department show extended conversations with convicted rapist and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The emails show Musk discussing a visit to Epstein’s island on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013. Epstein was first convicted of procuring a child for prostitution in 2008.

xAI maintains a headcount of over 1,000 employees, so the departures are unlikely to affect the company’s short-term capabilities. Still, the rapid pace of the recent departures had taken on a life of its own online, with users jokingly announcing on X that they too are “leaving xAI” despite never having worked there — a sign of how quickly the narrative of a “mass exodus” snowballed on Musk’s social network.

Still, forced co-founder exits are rarely a sign of smooth scaling. While Musk frames the reorganization as calculated, the fact that several engineers followed the co-founders out the door — and that at least three are starting something new together — suggests the departures may also reflect deeper tensions. In frontier AI, where talent is scarce and reputation matters, xAI’s ability to attract and retain top researchers will be tested as it competes with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.

The following employees have publicly announced their departures from xAI on X in recent days:

February 6:  Ayush Jaiswal, engineer, wrote: “This was my last week at xAI. Will be taking a few months to spend time with family & tinker with AI.”

February 7: Shayan Salehian, who worked on product infrastructure and model behavior post-training and was previously at X, wrote: “I left xAI to start something new, closing my 7+ year chapter working at Twitter, X, and xAI with so much gratitude.” He added that working closely with Elon Musk taught him “obsessive attention to detail, maniacal urgency, and to think from first principles.”

February 9: Simon Zhai, MTS (member of technical staff), wrote: “Today is my last day at xAI, feeling very fortunate about the opportunity. It has been an amazing journey.”

February 9: Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, co-founder and reasoning lead, wrote: “I resigned from xAI today. It’s time for my next chapter. It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”

February 10: Jimmy Ba, co-founder and research/safety lead, wrote: “Last day at xAI. We are heading to an age of 100x productivity with the right tools. Recursive self improvement loops likely go live in the next 12 months. It’s time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species.”

February 10: Vahid Kazemi, an ML PhD, wrote that he had left xAI “a few weeks ago,” adding: “IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it’s boring. I think there’s room for more creativity. So, I’m starting something new.”

February 10: Hang Gao, who worked on multimodal efforts, including Grok Imagine, wrote: “I left xAI today.” He described his time there as “truly rewarding,” citing contributions to Grok Imagine’s releases and praising the team’s “humble craftsmanship and ambitious vision.”

February 10: Roland Gavrilescu, the engineer who left in November to start Nuraline, posted: “I left xAI. Building something new with others that left xAI. We’re hiring :)”

February 10: Chace Lee, a member of the Macrohard founding team, wrote: “Taking a brief reset, then back to the frontier.” (Macrohard is an AI-only software venture under xAI designed to fully automate software development, coding, and operations using Grok-powered, multi-agent systems. Its name is a dig at Microsoft.)

February 11: Andrew Ma, who had been at xAI since X was called Twitter, worked on app and recommendation model improvements, including “the X video feed, search bar, user modeling, starter-packs and the home feed model.” He wrote: “I’m excited about the future- not sure what I’ll be doing yet (my DMs are open), but there is a world to be changed and no time to waste. Go team, stay focused, be energized, I can’t wait to see you all on the moon and beyond, believe me when I say there is no one that I trust more on the entire planet to get there, there is a world to win.”

February 12:  Radhakrishnan (Rad) Venkataramani, who worked on reasoning and reinforcement learning systems for Grok, wrote: “The last 8 months in RL systems/SWE-RL team pushing our coding model to be SOTA and toward recursive self improvement, will always be the most memorable of my lifetime…We’re at an inflection point where intelligence begins accelerating itself, and from here the trajectory only goes vertical.”

This article was originally published February 11 and has been updated to include additional employee departures.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Dutch phone company Odido has confirmed a data breach affected millions of its customers.

The company said in a statement Thursday that unidentified hackers gained access to its customer contact system and covertly downloaded reams of customer information. A spokesperson for Odido told local Dutch media that the breach affects more than 6.2 million customers, or about a third of the country’s population.

The stolen data includes customer names, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, dates of birth, bank account numbers (IBAN), and details of customers’ government-issued IDs, such as passport or driver’s license numbers and dates of validity.

The company said former customers who had service within the past two years may also be affected.

Odido said the data did not include customer call records, location data, billing information, or image scans of government IDs. The data does not affect business customers, the company said.

The breach affects customers of both Odido and its subsidiary Ben NL. Both companies said that their phone, internet, and television operations were unaffected by the breach.

This is the latest in a series of data thefts targeting phone and telecommunication giants in recent years, as governments and financially motivated hackers continue to seek highly confidential information that telcos have on their customers.

Earlier this week, the Singaporean government confirmed that a China-related hacking group had previously broken into four of the country’s top phone giants as part of a surveillance operation, but did not access customers’ personal information.

All the while, hackers associated with the China-backed threat group known as Salt Typhoon have hacked hundreds of phone companies around the world, including in Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as part of an ongoing espionage campaign aimed at spying on senior government officials and diplomats.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/amazons-ring-cancels-partnership-with-flock-a-network-of-ai-cameras-used-by-ice-feds-and-police/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ring, the Amazon-owned home security company, announced on Thursday that it will no longer partner with Flock Safety, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.

The two companies announced a deal in October, which would have allowed Ring doorbell users to share footage with Flock and its network of public safety agencies to assist with “evidence collection and investigative work.” As reported by 404 Media, Flock’s footage has been used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Secret Service, and the Navy, which all have had access to Flock’s tens of thousands of AI-enabled cameras. (Flock maintains that it does not explicitly work with ICE.)

Ring wrote in a blog post that it made a joint decision with Flock to cancel the partnership because the integration would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”

This news comes less than a week after Ring’s Super Bowl ad aired, which showed how its AI-powered Search Party feature could use a network of neighborhood cameras to find lost dogs. The ad stoked controversy from viewers who worried that this technology could be leveraged against humans.

A Ring spokesperson has stated that this technology is “not capable of processing human biometrics.”

But this technology is not dissimilar from that of Flock. Using footage from Flock cameras, Flock’s government and police partners can make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. When this AI-powered technology is used by law enforcement, it has been shown to exacerbate racial biases.

Ring even rolled out a facial recognition feature in December called “Familiar Faces,” which allows users to catalog the faces of people who often visit their homes — that way, they might get a notification that says “Mom at Front Door,” rather than “a person is at your door.”

This technology is being marketed to consumers during a time in the United States when people are especially cognizant of the dangers of mass surveillance. ICE uses this same type of facial recognition technology, powered by companies like Clearview AI, to locate people in its mass deportation efforts.

Though its partnership with Flock won’t come to fruition, Ring has existing measures that enable users to share footage with law enforcement if they so choose. The company accomplishes this in part through a partnership with Axon, a company similar to Flock.

Ring has also historically had trouble keeping customers’ videos safe and secure. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.

            <div id="article-text">As the top AI labs like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI chase enterprise adoption, Canadian AI startup Cohere has been quietly cleaning up.

The startup told investors in a memo that it surpassed its $200 million annual recurring revenue target in 2025, hitting $240 million with quarter-over-quarter growth of more than 50% throughout the year, per CNBC.

Cohere was founded in 2019 and has the backing of enterprise tech investors like Nvidia, AMD, and Salesforce. The startup’s core tech is its Command family of generative AI models, which Cohere says are efficient enough to be deployed on limited GPUs — an attractive promise for enterprises looking to get a handle on cost and resource management.

Last summer, Cohere launched North, a higher-level enterprise platform and AI workspace for secure, custom AI agents and workflows built on Cohere’s models.

Cohere’s CEO Aidan Gomez said last October that the startup may IPO “soon.” If “soon” means in 2026, Cohere may be contending against OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX/xAI, which are all reportedly weighing their own public debuts.

TechCrunch has reached out to Cohere for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta plans to add facial recognition to its smart glasses as soon as this year, according to a new report from The New York Times. The feature, internally known as “Name Tag,” would allow smart glasses wearers to identify people and get information about them through Meta’s AI assistant.

Meta’s plans could change, the report notes. The tech giant has been deliberating since early last year on how to release a feature that carries “safety and privacy risks.”

According to an internal memo, the company had originally planned to release Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the visually impaired before releasing it to the public, but didn’t end up doing that.

Meta reportedly saw the political tumult in the United States as a good time to release the feature.

“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the document reads.

Meta considered adding facial recognition technology to the first version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses back in 2021, but dropped the plans over technical challenges and ethical concerns. The NYT reports that the company has revived its plans as the Trump administration has grown closer to big tech, and following the unexpected success of its smart glasses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is the story that has been most commonly told about Brooke Nevils: While she was on assignment for NBC at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the Today show host Matt Lauer joined her and his co-host Meredith Vieira at their hotel bar for drinks. Afterward, she ended up in Lauer’s room. There, she later alleged, he took advantage of their power imbalance and her inebriation to pressure her into nonconsensual sex. In 2017 she reported him to NBC; the network fired Lauer, their $20-million-a-year star anchor. News outlets later revealed other complaints against him. Lauer repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and in a 2019 letter, he asserted that their relationship was consensual and said, “I have never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex. Period.”

That’s the summary that quickly spread across tabloids and celebrity-news sites. Now Nevils has offered a more expanded account, one that she believes could help an observer gain some understanding of what might have happened in one of the most high-profile cases of the #MeToo era. But her new memoir, Unspeakable Things: Silence, Shame, and the Stories We Choose to Believe, also aims to complicate the story. Nevils agreed to go to Lauer’s hotel room, she writes, in part because she wanted to delete unflattering photos he’d taken of her at the bar. She woke up the next day, she writes, crusted in blood. She recalls that she did not “say no or stop” when Lauer took off her jeans, and eventually “gave up” when he asked for anal sex. Why? As a personal assistant to on-air talent, she says she had learned to “ignore so many basic personal boundaries,” to “do things you don’t personally want to do” and “pretend to enjoy things you do not personally enjoy.” She visited Lauer in New York afterward several times, and had further sexual encounters, she writes, because she wanted to avoid being “a victim” and instead become “a master” of her own fate.

For all of these allegations, Unspeakable Things is less a bombshell than a bomb squad—it wants to carefully separate the wires, to parse and defuse the inner machinery of this kind of scandal. Just as much an investigator as a memoirist, Nevils attempts to tunnel through the lurid details and the #MeToo boilerplate and unearth something much knottier. &quot;My purpose here,&quot; she writes in a note at the beginning of the book, “is not to demand that you believe my side of the story without question, but instead to ask that you question all sides of your own beliefs about sexual harassment and assault.”

To that end, Nevils takes on several roles at once. She’s a seasoned journalist who brings to her book the research of more than 20 forensic psychologists, memory experts, scientists, attorneys, and authorities on sexual trauma. She sees herself as a sacrificial lamb, offering her own version of the story 12 years later, to provoke essential new conversations despite layers of pain. And she’s an accidental student, who began learning about sexual-assault myths in the psych ward where she spent 10 days after coming forward. Her big lesson? That rape and sexual-assault victims are more likely than not to behave in ways that would confound the average person, that stories that defy “common sense” are actually the norm, and that the jurors and journalists who weigh in on these cases do not have the full picture. All of this makes Unspeakable Things a particular type of #MeToo memoir, one in which the accuser implicates herself—not as complicit in any assault or harassment, but as fully human, and sometimes confounding even to herself.

Read: Everything we know about rape is wrong

Nevils lays out a variety of her own actions, during and after the event, that might baffle anyone who thinks they already understand the contours of #MeToo. When Lauer leaned to open the door to his room after their first encounter, she writes, she misread his body movements and hugged him. When he first kissed her, she admits, “even sober, I would have been flattered.” When he acted coldly toward her afterward, she worried that he was mad at her—and that the anger of “the Most Powerful Face in News” might tank her career—so she quickly tried to assure him, she writes, that she wouldn’t “be a problem.” For years after the incident, she says she told “sanitized” versions of the story, hinting that the two had had some kind of affair. She didn’t report it until a moment when many powerful men were being accused of terrible misdeeds.

After Nevils shares her own version of events, she shifts gears to offer a more general, though quite nuanced, education about sexual-assault myths. As one prominent researcher of violence against women tells her, “rape myths and common sense are the same thing.” (Nevils expresses discomfort with the term rape, though she uses it when discussing research.) She writes that women are often unlikely to behave as you might expect—to scream, to run, to call a friend, to use the word rape, to ask for a rape kit, to blame their attacker. Instead they might freeze, minimize the incident, avoid turning their body into a crime scene, revisit their attacker in an attempt to smooth things over. Just as rapists don’t all fit the image of, as Nevils puts it, “a man in a ski mask,” survivors do not necessarily act in preordained ways. As the forensic psychologist Veronique Valliere succinctly explained in her book Understanding Victims of Interpersonal Violence: “Victims do not expect to be attacked, so have no plan.” What they have instead is a series of instinctual responses to a wounding they might prefer to forget.

Nevils shares startling data to support these expert testimonies. The forensic psychiatrist Barbara Ziv, for instance, estimates that only about 30 percent of women fight back when being sexually assaulted by a stranger. Somewhere from 19 to 32 percent of victims have consensual sex with the perpetrator after an assault, according to a 2022 meta-analysis. And a study by Valliere found that “in 83 percent of cases, the people close to the offenders believed in their innocence, even when the offenders confessed or were caught in the act.”

With all of this in mind, Nevils regards the doubt that many people might feel about her story with a kind of forbearance bordering on the anthropological. In 2019, she spoke with the journalist Ronan Farrow for his book Catch and Kill, which investigated Harvey Weinstein, among others. After an excerpt of his book was leaked, she recalls, she “looked again and again at the comments online and asked myself—had none of this happened to me and I read these allegations, would I have believed me? I knew the answer was no. Even now, with everything I’ve learned, I still understand the hesitation.”

Although Unspeakable Things is a diary about the loss of control—after Sochi, Nevils began drinking heavily—it’s also an attempt to regain it. Nevils knows better than most the way that women in her position can be turned into paper dolls—flattened figures that are then covered up with flimsy constructions. She supplies a third dimension by dragging the reader, as she puts it, “into someone else’s ugly, irreconcilable conflict,” and then explaining why it looks so messy. The reader of Unspeakable Things isn’t being asked to play judge and jury, but to reexamine everything they think they know about sexual assault.

As Nevils explained in one recent interview, she now uses her husband’s last name, has left New York, and no longer works in television. If she hadn’t written this book, she might have been able to elude the tabloids, and the long arm of online search results, for the rest of her life. But Nevils is doing more than just unburdening herself. She is actually building scaffolding that other accusers—or anyone, really—can use to understand their own personal narratives. With that kind of structure, it might be possible to clamber up, take a look around, and see oneself from an unexpected point of view.

            <h2>Most People Don’t Have a ‘Type’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By the time I met Rich, I had whittled my list of must-haves for a romantic partner down to two: He must be Jewish, and he must have a permanent address.

He didn’t clear even this low bar. I’m not sure what made me fall for the Gentile giant who was crashing, as a “stopgap measure between things,” on the couch of my group house. But, reader, I married him.

This is not an uncommon trajectory. Many people think that they have a set type, and that all they need for eternal bliss is to find someone who matches it. When people peruse dating profiles, they’re often looking for someone who has specific interests, qualities, or hobbies. But according to a growing body of relationship research, many people end up marrying someone with few of their must-haves and a lot of “haves” they didn’t think they desired. A person might say that they’re looking for a partner who’s funny and conscientious, but then end up in a happy relationship with someone who is neither of those things. “People don’t know what they want,” Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario who studies relationships, told me, “and people don’t know what they’re going to like until they meet someone.”

Across many studies, people’s stated preferences don’t align well with the traits that incite their fondness for someone in real life. In a 2020 study, the UC Davis psychologist Paul Eastwick and his colleagues asked participants to list some ideal characteristics they wanted in a partner, and then sent them on a blind date. The researchers later asked the participants how closely the person they went out with had reflected both their own ideals and a list of someone else’s. People turned out to be just as romantically interested in a date who met the other person’s must-haves as they were in a date who met all of their own. “You are happy with somebody who fits your ideals,” Eastwick told me, “but you would have been just as happy with what your friend ordered off the menu.” This is where apps can fall short in terms of quality matchmaking. As Eastwick writes in his new book, Bonded by Evolution, compatibility can’t be determined by a dating profile; it has to be “curated, cultivated, and constructed”—usually as the relationship unfolds.

Even some “deal-breakers” may not end up breaking the deal. In one study by Joel, researchers told subjects that a hypothetical romantic partner had a trait that they said they wanted to avoid—poor hygiene, say, or anger issues—and many people said that they would continue to date the prospect anyway. Joel said that this inclination would likely be even stronger “in the context of a real relationship, where there’s feelings involved.”

That said, shared values do seem to matter to people: A 2020 report found that only 3 percent of American adults were married to someone from the opposite political party, for instance. Eastwick says that this happens because so many people either immediately screen out or simply never interact with a potential date who has opposing values—a hard-core Democrat might live in a neighborhood populated mostly with other Democrats, for example, or swipe left on all Republicans on Tinder. But if two people get together not knowing that they’re political opposites and the relationship takes off for other reasons, they might compartmentalize their differences or move closer to each other’s ideology. (“He’s probably going to become a libertarian,” Eastwick said, referring to the hypothetical Republican.)

Physical attraction matters, too—far more than most people realize, according to the researchers I spoke with. (Taylor Swift has it right when she sings, “Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot.”) If two people in a relationship are lucky, infatuation will set in: an obsessionlike mental state in which you find yourself thinking about the person a lot, noticing them, and wanting to be physically close to them. Once that initial spark ignites, motivated reasoning—essentially, seeing what you want to see—takes over. Joel theorized that people are prone to a “progression bias” in relationships: They are more inclined to encourage a relationship to continue than they are to dissolve it. Merely spending time together makes people become more invested in making a relationship work. “Once you like someone,” Joel said, “you want to see the best in them.” After Rich and I started dating, I began to notice his sharp and twisted sense of humor. Once while impersonating an old person trying to use Twitter, he called tweets “a telegram about yourself.” Is this the funniest thing ever? Not really. But in my eyes, at that moment, it was.

This kind of self-delusion is a good thing. Everyone, to some extent, grades their romantic partner on a curve, and relationships in which partners are especially inclined to do this may be particularly strong. In one study that Eastwick cites in his book, the longest-lasting relationships were the ones in which people justified their partner’s faults with “yes, but” statements such as “She is messy, but I wouldn’t ask her to give up her free-­spirited ways for anything.”

The problem is: The way people actually become attracted to each other can be hard to predict, Joel said. Not even scientists who have dedicated their life to studying chemistry can totally pin down its essence. Do you like the guy from Tinder and the joke he cracked about The Big Lebowski just because you were in an unusually good mood on the day you met up with him? If you’d been in a rotten mood, would you have liked him (and his stupid joke) less? I’m not sure I would have given Rich a second glance if he had not walked by my room in the group house one day while I was listening to “Portions for Foxes,” by Rilo Kiley, and exclaimed, “This is one of my favorite songs ever.” No man had ever complimented my taste in music before. It felt so refreshing—and well, kinda hot.

Read: The growing belief in ‘love at first sight’

All of this might help explain why many people who use dating apps struggle to find a long-term partner. With their emphasis on photos and profiles, Eastwick writes, “apps cater to our ideas about what we like much better than they cater to what we actually like.” Chemistry grows, and love is built on shared experiences and memories, but the apps tend to keep people trapped in small talk. Many users find themselves swiping endlessly without ever meeting up with someone. What’s more, Eastwick told me, apps can encourage people to judge their dates too quickly—and perhaps move on prematurely. “You might have a middling first impression of somebody,” he said, “but then you meet them again, and you end up really liking them.” The apps, however, present so many options that if a date is “anywhere south of great,” people may be inclined to hastily decide “I’m not gonna do the second date.”

The better way to find love, Eastwick suggested, is to get to know romantic prospects in person, over time. “Compatibility,” he said, “is about what you’re able to create together.” He recommended building deep friendship networks—both because those friends can introduce you to singles they know and because some of them might become romantic partners. But regardless of how you meet people, the crucial pieces are: Find someone you think is reasonably attractive and then hang out with them at least three times, doing things together that will inspire deep, connection-building interactions (such as playing a conversation card game and maybe answering the “36 Questions That Lead to Love” from that old New York Times essay). The person you spark with might be too tall or too short, or be a dog person to your cat person, or have an extremely boring job. Even so: They might be just your type.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.

Now Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.

Moscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.

To make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.

Read: Putin and Xi are holding the West together

The war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.

As Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.

Putin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.

Moscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.

Trump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.

Shortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Jack Waxman, a government major at Cornell, was a senior, he faced a choice. He could pursue a job in Senator Chuck Schumer’s office, where he had interned the previous summer. Or he could commit two years to teaching at a school in East Harlem.

Having started Teach for America, back in 1989, and then Teach for All—a network of similar organizations across more than 60 countries—I’ve spent almost four decades trying to inspire young people like Jack to work directly with low-income communities. It’s always been difficult, and it’s only gotten harder.

Jack was drawn to Teach for America. But he was torn. He felt the pull of a prestigious role on Capitol Hill, and the fear of falling behind peers who were headed to places such as Harvard Law School. Yet his most meaningful experiences in high school and college involved working on issues he cared about alongside the people affected by them—teaching math to inmates at a correctional facility, and advocating against the tobacco corporations that were getting his generation addicted to flavored e-cigarettes. A conversation with a Teach for America alumnus working in government sharpened his sense that proximity to problems matters. She lamented that many of the people around her were making policy decisions from “bubbles of power and prestige,” far removed from the communities touched by them. Jack chose the classroom.

Policy makers and philanthropists aren’t particularly focused on first jobs. But these choices matter—and not only for the individuals beginning their careers. If we want to address society’s most deeply rooted challenges—poverty, polarization, environmental degradation, geopolitical conflict—we need to encourage young people to work on these issues early in their careers, so they can grow into leaders capable of solving them.

Rose Horowitch: The entry-level hiring process is breaking down

While teaching in Harlem, Jack saw that a lack of resources made failure seem inevitable for the kids at his school. He also saw the incredible resilience and character of the students, families, and teachers. He realized just how entrenched inequity in education is, but he gained confidence in his ability to help address it. Jack is now in his first year at Columbia Law School. Once he graduates, he hopes to litigate for increased funding for education and better compliance with anti-discrimination and disability-rights laws.

Research confirms that working close to the roots of social issues early in one’s career fundamentally reshapes a person’s beliefs and life trajectory. Studies comparing Teach for America applicants who just made the cutoff for participation in the program with those who narrowly missed out found that the groups’ mindsets and priorities looked very different after two years. Those who had taught in under-resourced classrooms were more likely than those who hadn’t to view inequity as a systemic issue rather than the result of personal actions. They had more belief in the potential of students in low-income communities and in their own ability to make a difference. And about 75 percent of alumni across the Teach for All network, which includes Teach for America, go on to devote their careers to tackling systemic challenges faced by children, whether as educators, policy makers, or entrepreneurs.

The Peace Corps has been shown to have similarly formative effects; alumni have reported more awareness of other cultures, greater acceptance of diversity, and a sense of shared humanity that altered their understanding of justice. Peace Corps alumni have gone on to lead many initiatives in the public sector. It’s easy to see how other jobs aimed at meeting pressing social needs—serving as a case manager for unhoused people, for example, or working as an EMT—could shape one’s outlook in similar ways.

When I was a senior at Princeton back in 1989, my generation was known as the “Me Generation,” for our supposed self-absorption and individualism. I knew that the top students were going to work for banks and consulting firms not because of our generation’s values but largely because banks and consulting firms were the most active recruiters on campus. I was determined to create another avenue, and in my senior thesis proposed the development of Teach for America, which I founded the following year.

When students were offered a prestigious alternative to the corporate track, they revealed themselves to be more idealistic and civically committed than people had assumed. Over the years, more than 70,000 young people have joined Teach for America, and 50,000 more have gone through similar programs across the Teach for All network.

Still, two decades after Teach for America’s founding, despite its expansion and the creation of other public-service programs through AmeriCorps, the first job choices of graduates hadn’t changed all that much. In 2011, a Yale student published an op-ed decrying the narrow choices of so many of her peers. “If this year is anything like the last 10, around 25 percent of employed Yale graduates will enter the consulting or finance industry,” she wrote. “This is a big deal. This is a huge deal. This is so many people! This is one-fourth of our people!”

These percentages have only grown. In 2024, 35 percent of Yale’s senior class entering the workforce chose jobs in finance and consulting; add tech into the mix, and the share rises to 46 percent. At other schools—including Harvard, Princeton, Claremont McKenna, and Vanderbilt—at least half of the graduating class moved into those three fields. Meanwhile, the data I’ve seen on the share of students taking jobs close to inequity and injustice suggest a decline across the same period.

Some students, of course, feel they can’t afford to pursue less immediately lucrative careers. But if this was all that was holding graduates back, you’d expect to see more kids from wealthy backgrounds taking these jobs. Yet students from the highest-income backgrounds are the least likely to enter into public service and the most likely to pursue the corporate path.

Now that I have college-age kids myself, I’m once again seeing these dynamics firsthand. Corporations recruit students as early as freshman year, offering high-paying summer internships that are hard to resist. Preprofessional programs—such as Harvard’s Undergraduate Consulting Group, Princeton’s Tiger Capital Management, and the Blue Chips at the University of Chicago—seek out students, some even before college, and socialize them into these tracks as soon as they set foot on campus. Other organizations don’t have the resources to compete, making them less visible to students and less prestigious.

Despite their lofty mission statements about developing civic leaders, few schools push back against this corporate career funnel. Most colleges profess to be neutral when it comes to first jobs—but they benefit from the funding streams provided by prospective employers, who pay colleges thousands of dollars a year, and in some cases upwards of $20,000, to promote themselves to students through career-services offices.

Many students today are, understandably, anxious about the rise of AI and its effects on entry-level roles. But this development could also give us an opportunity to change the norms around first-job choices. Many corporations will soon need fewer staffers straight out of college to do routine work, but they will still need people among their senior ranks with strong leadership qualities. Companies will therefore have every incentive to push back their recruiting timelines and encourage young people to acquire crucial human skills first—the kinds of skills that can best be developed by working in communities to tackle social problems. And young people themselves, even those who might want to run a major company someday, would benefit immensely from devoting the early years of their careers to such challenges.

High schools should inspire students to step outside of their comfort zone and wrestle with pressing social issues. Colleges should live up to their civic missions by guiding students to take a first job in the public interest. The public and social sectors should create more options for students to do this sort of work, and ensure these options are visible and accessible. Corporations should start recruiting young people after they’ve gained these formative experiences, rather than the minute they arrive on campus. And we should all help young people see that their generation’s first jobs predict the future—not only of their careers but of their world.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Matt Walsh would like you to know you’ve been lied to. Last month, the right-wing provocateur appeared on Megyn Kelly’s show to discuss his new video series, Real History With Matt Walsh. “When you really start getting into it,” Walsh told Kelly, “you realize that, wow, they really lied about everything.”

He begins the series by examining the practice of chattel slavery, he said to Kelly, “because this is, we’re told, the original sin” of the United States. In Walsh’s account, the left believes that “America was built on slavery, and it has no right to exist, and every white American carries, somehow, that legacy, that guilt in their blood”; therefore progressives feel they have the “moral justification to just do whatever they want” to white people. Walsh intends to stop this. So in Real History, he relentlessly downplays the brutality of slavery in the United States.

Sanitizing slavery has become a core objective of the reactionary right under Donald Trump—a malignant response to the progressive left’s oversimplification of American history for their own present-day ends. But the truest understanding of slavery doesn’t serve any political faction. Rather, it acknowledges the horrors of racial oppression while still allowing us to see beyond them.

In 2019, Dean Baquet, then the executive editor of The New York Times, reportedly described “The 1619 Project” to his staff as “the most ambitious examination of the legacy of slavery ever undertaken” by a newspaper. Despite its grand ambition, however, the project arrives at a narrow conclusion: “One of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.”

This argument, which received ample criticism from historians at the time, seems to have emerged from the authors’ commitment to the ideological mission of the “anti-racist” left. As Baquet himself reportedly said, a major goal of the project was not historical but contemporary: “to try to understand the forces that led to the election of Donald Trump.” In reality, the project and its progressive defenders fed those forces rather than clarified them. Before Walsh could even finish explaining to Kelly why slavery occupies such a privileged place in his series, she cut in to provide an answer: Nikole Hannah-Jones, who led “The 1619 Project,” wants people to believe that slavery is, in Kelly’s words, “the whole reason America was formed.”

At the end of Trump’s first term, the White House released The 1776 Report in response to the Times initiative. As the Princeton historian Matthew Karp noted in Harper’s, the document contains a “range of pseudo-patriotic distortions about slavery and the founding era.” Nonetheless, Karp observed, “the report’s authors celebrated Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, praised Reconstruction, and condemned the postbellum South’s descent into Jim Crow, ‘a system that was hardly better than slavery.’”

Whatever modicum of analytical balance that report exhibits is absent in Trump’s second term. Reinterpreting the history of slavery has given way to suppressing its memorialization entirely.

The Trump administration has viewed Juneteenth with particular disdain. Last year, the president used the occasion not to remember emancipation but to complain that America had too many holidays. In December, he ordered the National Park Service to stop allowing free entry on Juneteenth and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Trump added Flag Day in their place, which falls on his own birthday.

Back in March, he strong-armed a host of institutions by issuing an executive order called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which directs federally funded museums, monuments, and parks to remove materials that promote “corrosive ideology.” Last month, the park service obliged, eliminating an outdoor exhibit at Independence National Historical Park, in Philadelphia, where George Washington’s house once stood. The exhibit honored nine slaves who toiled at the residence—part of an effort to explore “the paradox between slavery and freedom.” Such nuance appears to have violated the more patriotic version of history that the government seeks to instill.

The administration has applied perhaps the most pressure on the Smithsonian Institution. In August, the White House ordered the Smithsonian to implement “corrections” to any public-facing materials whose “tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals” the administration deemed unacceptable. On Truth Social, Trump made clear what he thought needed fixing: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” (The Smithsonian has turned over records to federal officials, but late last year, the group’s leader insisted to staffers that it alone was responsible for “all content, programming, and curatorial decisions.”)

In its campaign over the past year, the MAGA movement has squandered what might have been a reasonable position. David Greenberg, a historian at Rutgers University and a biographer of the civil-rights leader John Lewis, told me that the right could have made a persuasive case against the excessive preoccupation with slavery and racial politics that some on the left have shown. Instead, Trump and his allies seem unwilling to tolerate virtually any acknowledgment that America subjugated Black people. Rather than making a dispassionate case against the idea that the country was founded to enslave Africans, MAGA is taking down plaques commemorating basic facts, such as Washington’s slaveholding. “That’s not turning back the last 10 years,” Greenberg said. “That’s turning back historical understanding to the 1960s, if not further.”

In Real History, Walsh turns the clock back further still. One of his principal aims is to show that slavery was the norm across human history, and that American slavery was hardly the most extreme version. (Among other oversights, he fails to acknowledge that the link America forged between bondage and racial identity had little precedent in antiquity.) Walsh appears to think this lets American slaveholders off the hook. When all are guilty, he seems to suggest, no one is. The argument recalls Thomas Jefferson’s infamous defense of slavery in Notes on the State of Virginia. “We know that among the Romans,” Jefferson wrote, “the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent of America.”

Walsh also notes that the descendants of Africans trafficked to what became the United States are now in better socioeconomic shape than those whose ancestors remained in the Old World or were transported to Latin America or the Caribbean. He draws an odious conclusion from this—American slavery wasn’t that bad—yet the point is not entirely incorrect. Other far more serious thinkers have made versions of it too.

America’s slaves lived “in the presence of more human freedom and individual opportunity than they or anybody else had ever seen before,” the Black critic Albert Murray wrote in his 1970 essay collection, The Omni-Americans. “The conception of being a free man in America was infinitely richer than any notion of individuality in the Africa of that period.” Many slaves, Murray noted, internalized this ideal of American freedom despite their own subjugation. “The fugitive slave, for instance, was culturally speaking certainly an American, and a magnificent one at that.”

Clint Smith: Tell students the truth about American history

And this points to the crux of the matter. When recounted accurately, from beginning to end, the story of slavery is the most inspirational and unifying narrative that the country has. Today’s multiethnic society is deeply flawed, of course, but the fact that it emerged from such cruel beginnings should be a source of pride for Americans of every background.

“The destruction of slavery is one of the great American achievements,” Sean Wilentz, a historian at Princeton and critic of “The 1619 Project,” told me. “Taking slavery seriously in American history is not anti-American. The story of slavery in the U.S. is about an ancient institution that was planted here, thrived here, and then was confronted and ultimately attacked in the 19th century through enormous sacrifice, including military conflict. That’s an extraordinary American story.”

For MAGA revisionists as well as some progressives, commemorating slavery implies that the U.S. is permanently stained by it. Yet downplaying or exaggerating American slavery threatens something even graver than perpetual guilt: the loss of the country’s shared moral language.

The story of slavery and its abolition is ultimately one of irrepressible human dignity. Properly told, it makes reconciliation possible and future injustice avoidable.</div>

The video tape rental business solved this type of issue by billing customers if they returned a tape without rewinding it.

Add an extra charge to a fare if they don&#39;t properly close the door.  If the door won&#39;t close, they can report a fault to avoid the charge.  It&#39;ll cut down drastically on the need to hire third parties and completely avoid the need to add automatic door closure systems.

It seems like a trivial problem to solve. Japanese taxis have had this for decades, a little button that opens and closes the door. Catches out many tourists.

The automotive industry solved this problem with self-closing doors. Waymo somehow didn&#39;t figure out that vehicles with this feature should be mandatory for a self-driving car service. This is stupidly obvious.

https://tech.slashdot.org/stor... [slashdot.org]

i cannot for the life of me think back to a single instance where i forgot to shut the door to my car. are people actually forgetting or are they just being shitty?

i hope the passenger get a hefty surcharge.

I&#39;m really hoping it&#39;s a case of the door not closing completely - where it&#39;s held closed but the car&#39;s sensor still reports it as open.

But damn, Waymo. Why don&#39;t your cars have the ability to close its own doors, at the very least by human intervention from the warmth of an office after verifying the customer is long gone?

As I understand it, this happens so rarely that even spending $500 on retro-fitting every car isn&#39;t justified.

1. Become DoorDash driver, and follow Waymos when you see them2. Tell them to leave a door open (not ??????)ÂÂ. Split the profits!

Not everything needs to get a clean solution. One that works is often enough, especially when temporary.

I like this approach. It has a certain messy elegance.

Future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures.Given Waymo&#39;s excellent record at avoiding problems I&#39;m sure that will be trouble free.

Well what should states do as far as secondary ed?

I think we can all agree that ensuring all graduates can in fact read well, posses some number sense in the form of statistics, be able to do common algebra, and perhaps basic differential calculus, and know some things about the natural sciences.

Most states are failing pretty hard at that and our education-industrial-complex finds all manor of excuses ranging from more-inflation-adjusted-spending-per-pupil than at any point in history just isn&#39;t enough, to

As a child you have no idea what you want to do with your life. The goal of high school should be both to educate in critical areas (reading, math, social studies, financial literacy, health, etc) but also to expose students to the broadest amount of trades possible. I think students should spend time writing code as much as they should spend time disecting an animal, mixing a chemical, or welding. Only through doing can we learn what our passion is.

If a student never experiences something how can they decide to do it as a career?

West Virginia needs to stop doing whatever the hypest corporation tells it to do.Corporation? Our own government the last 5 years or so took the position that every kid should learn to code, because there was no future in things like, oh, honest manual work. AI has fucked the assumptions of everyone from the halls of Congress all the way to Silicon Valley.

Not everybody needs to know how to program, and those people who were being forced into taking a CS class were likely never going to be all that good at it.

If anything, they were likely creating the next generation of managers who think that they understand IT because they took one college course in it. They know just enough to have dangerous assumptions, but not enough knowledge to be genuinely useful.

They are probably correct.  The reality is that trying to make &quot;coding&quot; a forced part of graduation for 100% of students, to me, seems very extreme.  Especially when the majority of them will actually never code afterwards.  And also especially in an AI era where a lot of

I would argue that this is a better choice.  People need to know basics of things, like backups, personal security, 2FA, dealing with the ever growing onslaught of scams, phishing attempts, and many other things.  A CS course provides far less value than a  basic user education course.

Let CS be a thing, but first teach safeguards and how not to get obliterated by a criminal org first.

Imagine if a company demanded you install a camera in your bedroom, that you couldn&#39;t turn off, cover, or obscure.  You have no access to the feed from the camera, when it&#39;s on, or what it captures.  You have no control over what happens to the video, who it&#39;s shared with, and how it&#39;s analyzed.  Furthermore, you have to take on pure faith the good intentions of the company.   Do you trust them, would you go ahead with accepting that policy?   Of course not, but many privacy policies are effectively no better, and now imagine it&#39;s not your bedroom, it&#39;s your child&#39;s, and it becomes clear why you need to carefully review privacy policies.    For anyone who thinks your government will protect you, if the company baselessly claims they won&#39;t hand out the video, or misuse the contents, that generally satisfies the majority of federal security policy. If you read that, and still find privacy policy boring, you&#39;re not paying attention.

How are they going to understand a programming language?

You will need to get informed consent from anybody you want to apply this to beforehand, in writing. In Germany, if it is not directly visible these are recording devices, even possession may be illegal.

This is also illegal in the state of Illinois, has been since 2008. https://www.ilga.gov/Legislati... [ilga.gov]

Wyze cameras have a friendly faces feature, you can&#39;t enable it in Illinois.

They will have to geofence this for certain areas

Good. At least some legislators in the US get it.

You are required to stare at a new face every 3 seconds.

Unfortunately the cat is out of the bag on this, it is basically unpreventable. Facial recognition can be applied to any video stream or recording from existing surveillance cameras, such as one that&#39;s pointed at the entrance to the supermarket where you shop. These rayban glasses are merely a mobile platform for acquiring the video. Packing the recognition tech into such a small package is a demonstration that it can be deployed almost anywhere.

Alternate Translation: That Super Bowl ad with the dog rescue thing kinda backfired on us. We&#39;ll try again in six months when nobody is paying attention with just some small modifications to the privacy policy contract. Let&#39;s hope that nobody important notices.

The bigger issue is, it&#39;s become pretty obvious Flock gives these entities access to their cameras and images regardless of the existence of a warrant - and without getting permission from (or even notifying) the Flock customer who&#39;s paying for the camera.

Of course Flock gives LEO access to everything frictionlessly. Their main business is selling ALPR systems to LEO and related local government, so the pitch will be buy ALPR and we give you access to all this other coverage.

They just sell directI mean they&#39;ve got all the data they&#39;ve got a brazilion computers to store and process that data.What do they need flock for in the first place?

I put one camera up(not ring and locked down) because my 80 year old neighbor was snooping.  I got video of her walking onto our porch staring through the windows and trying the door she then step off the porch without a step and walked away.  She can barely walk if she took that big step down onto soft garden dirt and fell her head would have bounced off brick walkway.

I have since put up two more cameras to cover the doors of my home as I also had footage of her walking around our backyard when we

Amazon Ring, flocked up, a new ring of &quot;truthiness.&quot; Then in a year, it will be announced they did a deal with some other surveillance company, ring around the rosie.

Ring cameras in the US are apparently usually mounted so that they film your entryway, behind that the public sidewalk and street, and across from that your neighbor&#39;s house. To me - in Europe - that seems insane. Here, it is generally illegal to film public areas, because people have a right to move through the world without being tracked. And it is hugely illegal to film other people&#39;s property, because - well, that ought to be obvious - it&#39;s their property and not yours.

And yet here we have a business that not only lets you record all of that, but actively hands it out to anyone who wants it, for any reason whatsoever.

I have nothing against cameras filming what&#39;s happening on your own property, but Ring has normalized surveilling your neighbors.

> Here, it is generally illegal to film public areas, because people have a right to move through the world without being tracked.

Where exactly is &quot;here&quot;? CCTV coverage in Europe seems pretty pervasive, from what I&#39;ve seen. All sorts of tracking, people and ANPR, presumably by the government.

You have allowed insect carcases to interfere with camera access.

The typical home surveillance system gives high resolution full coverage of your property but frequently also includes nearby street traffic and the activity at all of the surrounding residences. You can stream the video to a cloud system and potentially share it however you want. Here&#39;s one company that ties it all together conveniently for you but there are several others such as Videoloft and Camcloud;  https://www.een.com/ [een.com]

What app should I download now to be eKaterina-fished by hot Saint Petersburg babes?

The government-sponsored Maks chat engine, which is linked to the State Services portal.

It is very neat, as you can not only find the St. Peterburg&#39;s babes videos, but also see your kid&#39;s grades from school in it, submit a report on your neighbors&#39; enemy activities, apply for a stormtrooper slot in the Special Military Operation and even send your farewell video to your widow up to the very moment that drone kills you.

It is a great service, the greatest service that was ever designed.

Out of Greenlad solidarity we should do the same in Europe. US Tech is a danger to the liberties in our societies. It is a small measure we could take against the Trump regime and hiis backers.

They are blocking VPNs since way before the war embargoes and escalations (I presume there are some state approved VPNs but they would be worse than no VPN).

Every country would want the data of their people to be local, and be on servers physically in their countries.  Law enforcement cooperation too is required: what makes it controversial is the extent to which a country&#39;s laws goes after real criminals vs people who the government just doesn&#39;t like.  Also, if a social media platform makes it a point to censor views supportive of a country&#39;s position - in this case Russia&#39;s, it&#39;s not surprising that the country in question would have problems allowing them to

How are they blocking WhatsApp? Is there a Great Firewall of Russia?

The article mentions DNS removal, essentially DNS filtering. But, DNS filtering is an inconvenience, far from a &quot;complete block&quot;.

So, what&#39;s up with WhatsApp in Putinstan.

If you work as Russian government troll spreading propaganda in the west you can still use WhatsApp in your work.

The idea is to make it harder people from the West to reach people in Russia, not trolls in Russia to reach people in the West...

You took something simple like Notepad, added features we didn&#39;t want, and not only made it worse but actually made it insecure and fundamentally broken.

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.

The goal of Microsoft is to keep turning record profits after they saturated the market 30 years ago. Want to make sure your endpoints are up to date on patches? They now have a subscription for that. Want to avoid installing crap like this in the first place? They have a subscription for that too.

What Microsoft overlooks is that there is a red line where they will just die if they cross it. They are dangerously close to that line and may be over it. I mean, how utterly incompetent can you get? A mistake like the one here can only happen if security aspects were completely ignored during development.

Any good monopolist knows that they have to deliver at least somewhat reasonable quality to retain the monopoly. MS does not understand that. Hence their products are now incompetently made toys.

That&#39;s generally true but MS is only obliquely in the OS game it seems to me. They are concentrating on &quot;cloud&quot; and &quot;AI&quot;, and companies are sending them money for these things. So they can completely screw the pooch on their toy OS and run all their crap on Unix and Linux and I doubt that would phase them. They probably already have versions of their biggest money spinner software running on those platforms.

And yet their cloud offerings have been hacked several times now and had additional really bad vulnerability where nobody know whether they got exploited ...

I think I do not need to even comment on the future of their AI plans ...

Seems like they&#39;re turning their desktop OS into a heavy client for &#39;teh cloud computing&#39;.

Keep seeding their regular OS with security issues and then their reps can point to their &#39;managed OS client&#39; and meet quarterly goals on subscritption numbers.

Hmm. Obviously, they cannot hack this. But you may be on to something and they may be planning this.

And taking a simple but still useful product like Notepad, and bitching it up to the point that it is now a malware vector has me shaking my head, not in disbelief, but &quot;here we go again&quot;.  At this point, I only use my Windows Laptop if there&#39;s no other choice. I swapped out the space it was in for a Raspberry Pi 5 I&#39;ve been playing with, and my not updatable to Windows 11 laptop that screams along on Linux Mint.
Now for myself, a geek - it&#39;s not all that surprising to abandon Microsoft as much as possible. But I&#39;m getting feedback And am giving instructions  from and to quite a few others who aren&#39;t such geeks. Technical adjacent. People who need a stable platform, who need a bit more than email, and web browser.  And are tired of Windows update hell. And some times Microsoft even bitches up their own programs. 

There are still a fair number off people out there who believe Microsoft is some kind of permanent entity. That it will be the goto solution until the universe experiences proton decay. Reminds me of Ozymandias &quot;My name is Microsoft, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;

I think we are at a decision point now. It can still go either way. I hope we will get the momentum that we can finally all ditch Microsoft over the next few years.

I would have said it was impossible, but the destruction of the US government is making it possible. If you couple people&#39;s latent but generally willfully ignored mistrust of Microsoft on a quality basis with their newly stoked distrust of the USA on a fascism basis, that might actually be enough to get them switching.

Here in the US there is enough nationalist denialism to keep it from happening on a large scale soon, but in the rest of the world, it might now be a thing. And then that will have repercussio

That&#39;s one of the problems they have when they attain an optimal product.  They have to start changing things just for the sake of change, and in the process, ruin the experience for customers.  Instead, they should have reassigned those people to other projects, and just had security updates for Windows

Intel ruined itself by competing w/ its customers, and Microsoft is on that road by ruining the user experience.  I don&#39;t see this end well

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.Yes. But that would require somebody sane with some actual insight and understanding of IT security at Microsoft making decisions. They do not have such people.

I don&#39;t know why these companies don&#39;t realize when you take an application that can&#39;t execute anything and you make it into an application that will execute anything depending on embedded codes, it&#39;s worth scrutinizing it.  If you don&#39;t have the manpower or skills available to scrutinize it then you don&#39;t change it.  Isn&#39;t that obvious?

I thought that Windows 10 was great given that it restored at least somewhat the UI we were used to in 7.  I remember switching from 8.1 to 10 the moment 10 was released: it was a joy to get back to that UI

I have been seeing recent videos benchmarking everything from XP to 11.  8 actually topped in performance, if one ran those tests: it was too bad that it was laden w/ that Metro interface.  Had Microsoft left the Windows 7 interface on it - maybe just changing the windows button - while providing it w/

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.Prevented in what way? Your post is non-sequitur.Firstly, the simple version of Notepad has had quite a few critical security flaws over the years. https://threatpost.com/researc...

Wordpad was dropped because it was a potential security attack surface.Thirdly, Wordpad didn&#39;t support markdown meaning that this exploit right now has zero to do with Wordpad&#39;s existence.Yea

That version of notepad has been running smoothly since 1995.  All it is is open a file, enter text into it and save the file.  What security vulnerabilities does that have?  It&#39;s up to the OS to prevent any malicious scripts from running

You took something simple like Notepad, added features we didn&#39;t want, and not only made it worse but actually made it insecure and fundamentally broken.This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad. This!!!  +5

The ideal thing for Microsoft to have done would have been to leave Notepad alone, and add those features to Wordpad instead!  The latter already handled rich text, but they could have added tables, as well as support for tabs.  That would have been far more useful

On a separate note, in Paint, Microsoft could have added tabs there, and made it more useful that way.  One of the things I used to do w/ Paint was use it to combine images to make a custom wallpaper.  W/ the latest version of Pain

I really wanted some upgrades to Notepad. Specifically, I wanted multi-level undo and proper multi-click selection.

I wanted literally nothing else but I got it anyway.

Since Notepad actually just forgets all the edits you&#39;ve made to a file on a network share if connectivity is lost I can no longer use Notepad for my prior use case. At all. Now I have to use Word. Word doesn&#39;t forget in that scenario, it &quot;only&quot; refuses to allow you to save to the same filename. As an aside, Excel doesn&#39;t forget either, and it

Microsoft has no security mind-set, while having a lot of security-critical products. Obviously, they mess it up time and again. Although the level of sheer incompetence on display here is astonishing even for them. Also remember &quot;Security is our highest priority&quot; (stated last probably in 2024 by MS CEO). If they make mistakes this grossly clueless and dangerous now, it just means they cannot do it right. No other interpretation is possible.

I just think the cause is a bit different.

They have this habit of making everything as general as possible without thinking through the implications, while trying to &quot;extend&quot; anything they didn&#39;t make. So you end up with a generic URL parsing library that will happily launch installers from a text file in Notepad and similar nonsensical capabilities nobody in their right mind would intentionally use. Software for Martians, borne out of nai

I agree with your statement. But I do not think that is a different reason. They have no security mind-set and no actual security experts involved in the decision making. That is what I would call &quot;cannot do security&quot;. In the case at hand, any halfway competent IT security expert would have told them that this was excessively risky. Remember the log4shell vulnerability? This is basically the same stupid thing.

Incidentally, this bright-eyed &quot;can do&quot; attitude is the hallmark of bloody amateurs.

Youtuber Low Level did a pretty good video on this vulnerability. Yes it is a bad vulnerability and yes it is serious, but it&#39;s not like a user isn&#39;t warned several times when clicking on such a link.

He also pointed out that the drive to put AI into everything now makes restricting process permissions a lot harder. For example in the past there was no reason to ever let notepad.exe access the internet.  Now with copilot integrated, it&#39;s regularly accessing the internet.  I don&#39;t think the boys at MS were thinking this through clearly.https://youtu.be/sZ8aAkeZ6dw [youtu.be]

but it&#39;s not like a user isn&#39;t warned several times when clicking on such a link. But why does every app have to be a browser? Is this functionality going to be added to solitaire? Why not?To me it seems that if Microsoft was in the tool business every thing would need to be, or function like, a hammer.

Should I upgrade my win10 to win11? Am I late to the party?

The best thing to do would be to install a hypervisor on your computer, and then, on top of that, run whichever OS you fluently work in.  As an example, let&#39;s say you install Hyper-V.  On top of that, you have a Windows 10 VM in which you do all your work, but don&#39;t connect it to the internet.  Use a Linux or BSD distro that Hyper-V supports for any internet related activities, such as web browsing

So you could have Hyper-V, and on top of that, have 2 VMs - Windows 10 and Debian.  Use the latter for web br

Notepad has been released for DOS in 1983 and for windos in 1985.It seems 40 years just is not enough time to create a half decent text editor!

It was great all this time.  One opened a file, entered text, saved the file and one was done.  What else was needed?  Yeah, it didn&#39;t have certain features that programmers might like, but I suspect programmers generally pick their own editors for their work

Microsoft claimed they were discontinuing Wordpad to reduce security flaw exposure from barely used unpatched and unmaintained software.

But at least they are consistent. Microsoft has a history of security issues on really basic software such as Notepad https://threatpost.com/researc... [threatpost.com]

Let the stream of malware happily continue...

I just need a good text editor with 4 functions:Open (text-only files), save, search and replace.No markdown support, no AI copilot, no formatting, no lists, no URL support, no tables, no autocorrect.

Ya know, kinda just like the old notepad, except with the ability to show line numbers (the only thing I thought notepad needed). I saw the new one still can&#39;t either, despite all its other kitchen-sink bloat.

You can still do that, you just need to jump through some hoops- Disable app execution aliases for notepad.exe- Uninstall the new notepad &quot;app&quot;- Your old notepad application will be restored. It was never removed, and still lurks quietly in the C:\Windows\System32 folder.

Dave Plummer did that recently in one of his videos [youtube.com].  He essentially had Claude re-write NotePad to have features identical to the one in XP, and called it RetroPad

There are many things for Europeans to worry about as they watch the Trump administration blow up the international order. There is the chaos of having international markets careening around the whims of one man. There is the ominous talk from an aggressive superpower lusting over Greenland. There is the catastrophic dismantling of efforts to rally the world to address the climate crisis.

But for certain European countries, Donald Trump poses a threat that taps into a more intimate and sickeningly primal fear: that Americans will force-feed them our disgusting chicken. Specifically, our “chlorine chicken,” Europe’s term for American chemically washed poultry.

“EXCLUSIVE: UK-US Trade Deal: Keep Your Chlorine Chicken America, Britain Must Not Pay This Price,” read one British headline from May. “Don’t Like the Idea of Chlorinated Chicken? You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet,” read another.

The panic over “chlorine chicken” is a noble British tradition that reappears every time the public considers the prospect of deepening its economic entanglement with the U.S. This particular European bogeyman dates back to 2014, when the U.S. and the European Union were negotiating a trans-Atlantic trade agreement. All the European countries shared the U.S. poultry aversion at the time: Germany calls it, we’re happy to report, chlorhühnchen. But the U.K. has more justification for its fears these days, as Brexit left its regulations more open to adjustment.

Now, the nation is in the grip of its latest chicken panic: British media have reported that the Trump administration is once again pressuring the U.K. to concede some of its food standards. In December, the Telegraph reported an alarming story with the headline “White House Demands British Supermarkets Stock Chlorinated Chicken.” According to the report, it all came down to a $40 billion technology agreement the White House had scrapped with the U.K. That failed deal was part of a cluster of agreements between the two nations meant to supplement the larger deal from May, which had excluded some economic sectors. The tech deal would have set terms for the nations’ collaboration over artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But in December, the White House quashed the deal, citing displeasure with the U.K.’s online safety rules, its digital services tax—and, strangely, food safety rules.

As the Telegraph described the negotiations, the U.S. trade envoy had been quite pointed about the food safety matter, particularly as it related to poultry and beef. Even though the deal had nothing to do with food, if the country wanted to revive it—something that promised significant investment from the U.S.—it would need to get over its squeamishness.

The British people don’t care for this. According to the British agricultural press, more than 150,000 Brits have since signed petitions urging their supermarket chains to “publicly rule out chlorinated chicken.” The angst lingers into the new year. It appears that the British public is realizing that fending the chlorine chicken off once doesn’t mean it won’t pop right back up as a matter of debate: As Trump has continued to toy with the global financial order, American unpredictability has changed the nature of this particularly British anxiety. No longer does the poultry panic emerge just for agricultural trade deals; Trump has made “chlorinated chicken” a permanent low-level threat, a dark, feathered cloud hovering over the British Isles. Thanks to Trump’s reputation for capriciousness, the great poultry panic may just be here to stay.

To be clear, “chlorine” is not a fully accurate word to describe American chicken; per the National Chicken Council, less than 5 percent of American chicken is treated with chlorine. Nowadays, the industry uses more effective cleaners, such as peracetic acid, a kind of all-purpose antimicrobial agent used in hospital cleaners, produce washes, and meat processing.

The data remain unclear as to whether the American method is actually that much worse, but the problem is more one of the general imagination: In the British mind, their chickens (and all other livestock) are dutifully cared for in sanitary, healthy conditions from birth to slaughter, keeping them disease-free from the start. Our chickens, on the other hand, are treated abominably, packed in tightly with their germy brethren, raised in squalor, pumped with hormones, and only made clean at the end. It’s a matter of washing off the filth—with unnatural chemicals, at that—versus never picking up the filth in the first place. This picture gives the Brits the heebie-jeebies. It’s not a fully accurate picture, as the British do still have factory farms, but it’s true that their standards for animal welfare are higher and that they don’t use nearly as many antibiotics. And it’s also true that their food safety philosophy about keeping away contamination at all stages is entirely different from the American fix-it-later mentality.

It was this cultural gag reflex that caused the specter of American chicken to become a major point of contention during Brexit, when people became worried the renegotiated trade deals would make their own food-safety attitudes vulnerable to assault from our population’s street-rat standards. Indeed, the U.S. tried: In 2019, BuzzFeed News reported that the first Trump administration was offering to pay up to $92,000 to have British journalists brought in on a tour of U.S. farms, with the goal of addressing “misconceptions” about chlorinated chicken.

The Brits warded off the American chicken then, but only after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the leader of the Labour Party a “gigantic chlorinated chicken.” Then, as now, everyone across all ideological lines feared the chicken; accusing political opponents of being soft on chlorine chicken is a legitimate attack. When Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, argued that the U.K. should allow chlorinated chicken (the British already ate questionable chicken from Thailand, he argued), it was a minor scandal. In 2023, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak solemnly vowed there would “be no chlorine-washed chicken and no hormone-treated beef on the U.K. market. Not now, not ever.”

But the Americans have fought for the chicken. Most recently, when the U.S. and U.K. negotiated a new trade deal last spring, the Trump White House did, indeed, try to bully the country into adjusting its food standards. The White House called them “non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.” (Headlines: “Trump Tells UK to Buy Their Chlorinated Chicken if They Want Tariff Relief.”) White House adviser Peter Navarro tried to assert that the Brits were missing out on a “very fine American agricultural product,” and “we don’t believe that once they taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to reassure the public that the government wouldn’t budge on this, and thanks to pressure from constituents, it didn’t.

But this bowel-clenching British fear didn’t simply disappear. Trump has continued to harangue the country about food standards, even after the Brits thought they’d struck a chlorine-free deal less than a year ago. And that’s the bigger problem: Alliances depend on trust, and the U.S. can no longer be trusted to keep its word—even when it comes to not forcing our icky chicken on Europeans.

The release of the Epstein files—the slow-drip revelations of a web of privileged (mostly) men trading gifts, access, favors, and sickening child predation as casually as Pokémon cards—has been deliberately parsed out through 2026 as to both be buried itself and bury other horrific news coming out of the Trump administration. But this misses a critical point: The Epstein file dump is not simply playing out as a backdrop against which other acts of American lawlessness are occurring. The Epstein story is also the template and the proof text for all that is happening in Minnesota; at dangerous detention centers; in efforts to punish members of Congress for lawful speech; for crypto scams; and for measles outbreaks. It is an ongoing road map for an administration that lives out the reality that they are rich and powerful and famous enough to be above the law each day, and wishes for the rest of us to ultimately learn and accept that fact.

So it follows that Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying blithely before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, as Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors sat behind her, unacknowledged and irrelevant to her purposes, is the template for that messaging: Blond woman who knows she must seek and maintain protection from this administration’s simulacrum of justice crows about the Dow Jones for the cameras, because she understands that if she doesn’t, she will be left behind, asking to be respected, like the masses of women behind her.

And it is equally true that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bring his children and their nannies to a bespoke lunch on Epstein’s island in 2012, long after he allegedly broke off contact with the sex predator, precisely because Lutnick’s children and their nannies were not the types of children or women who would be abandoned there to be raped and threatened. He is also a walking infomercial about whom the law protects and whom it leaves broken and invisible, behind. Lutnick’s testimony this past week, like Bondi’s, is thus operating as a still life in what happens when the law becomes inert. On the one hand, it is not relevant as a restraint to those who need not rely on it; on the other, it is not protective for those who do.

Liz Plank, on her Substack, describes the nausea and disorientation felt by women realizing this past week that we had all been gaslit yet again. Those of us who cannot even begin to imagine a permission structure that allowed and encouraged passing young girls around, trading insults and articles about them (“your littlest girl was a little naughty”), and bonding over the hysteria of #MeToo can barely comprehend why it was that this class of men always took the gift and the freebie and the shitty watch and the plane trip, because access to yet more of the same somehow became the coin of the realm. What Plank describes as “trust bias”—the psychological tendency to assume that others are operating within the same moral and ethical universe as yourself—means that we are all, once again, annihilated by the fact that America’s shared moral universe is a collective fiction, one that constrains one class of people and merely titillates another.

We err when we call what is being done by ICE officials to citizens and noncitizens on the streets of American cities “law,” just as we err when we call what has thus far been afforded the Epstein survivors “justice.” Indeed, the word law is too generous to contain the plea deals and the willing ignorance and the prison transfers that were granted to Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators at every turn. And the word injustice is far too small to describe the spectacle of hundreds of survivors who have still not been given a reckoning or a measure of genuine accountability, whose unredacted names appeared in public documents and who had never been contacted by the Department of Justice.

Pam Bondi may be in charge of many officials and many investigations and many legal things at the DOJ, but what she is protecting is neither justice nor law. And that means that what Plank describes as a trust bias is also an exquisitely American “law bias,” and we should dispense with the notion that we are all in some group compact to protect and preserve the same things. The law is neither protecting the vulnerable nor constraining the Epstein class. And perhaps we should stop referencing that word to mean either project, much less deploying it to describe both.

What Bondi, and Donald Trump, and Lutnick, and Todd Blanche are doing under the banner of law and law enforcement and pardons and immunity and impunity is an operatic performance of a single truth: The “law” will now protect those who are within the network of favors and privilege and secrets and side-eyes and snickers and abuse of young girls, and the “law” will also abandon those who are not. What Bondi did this week under the bright lights of the U.S. Congress was to personify that the law is a word for the thing that is “weaponized” when it’s used against the president, and is the thing that is bestowed benignly on those who seek his grace. This is a protection racket, and we are being conditioned in plain sight to recognize that it protects itself and it preys on everyone who refuses to buckle.

This isn’t to say that the law is meaningless. Judges across the country prove every day that the law is still the last, best guardrail against that sort of nihilist thinking. But the attorney general’s performance was an hourslong spectacle enacted solely to highlight who lives above the law and who must beg it for scraps. We should probably stop calling this law and call it simply “power.” Just as we could stop calling Bondi the AG and call her Trump’s constitutional Roomba. We should almost certainly stop calling the Epstein survivors anything other than the legal heroes and dreamers they are.

On Wednesday, I went for a walk outside around a lake near my home. I didn’t wear a mask. I could see, clearly, the buildings on the other side. I came home feeling happy and invigorated.

This doesn’t sound like much, but I live in Hanoi, Vietnam, a city that frequently ranks as one of the world’s most polluted. It is an incredible place to live: culturally vibrant, wonderfully optimistic, with notoriously excellent food. But when it’s “pollution season”—roughly October to March—too much time outdoors and without a mask means headaches, an itchy throat, and sore lungs, not to mention an elevated risk of everything from asthma to dementia to various cancers. On Wednesday, we had a rare afternoon where the Air Quality Index was below 100. The air quality on my app was yellow, or moderate—not even the elusive green, which signals good air—but in a Hanoi winter, yellow is a gift.

By the time I went on my only-moderately-polluted walk, I had already been assigned to write a column about the Trump administration’s obliteration of efforts to fight climate change. I was mulling how incredible it is that Americans live in a wealthy, developed, incredibly prosperous nation; that we generally enjoy clean water, clean land, and clean air, and even clean air in our largest cities; that we enjoy that level of cleanliness in large part thanks to the environmental movement and the many rules and regulations environmentally conscious politicians have put into place; and that there are right-wing American activists who have dedicated their careers to undoing all of it—and there’s a large contingent of American voters who support them.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, run by climate change denialists and people who seem oddly hostile to the environment they are in charge of protecting, is revoking the “endangerment finding,” a ruling that underpins much of the government’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The endangerment finding operates under the Clean Air Act, and to be clear, that law has not yet been revoked (although they would if they could). But overturning the endangerment finding undermines the law’s ability to do anything about climate change—and it’s hard to overstate just how devastating this deregulation will be for the planet. Scientists are unified in the understanding that pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the earth, which in turn drives natural disasters, drought, disease, flooding, and even war.

The fight isn’t over. Environmental and public health groups will immediately sue to protect the (glaringly obvious) finding that the propellants of catastrophic climate change do indeed present a risk to public health. But the administration is ready to take their case to a very deregulation-friendly and Trump-favoring Supreme Court. They’re seeking a quick result so that they can take a sledgehammer not just to environmental regulations, but to the federal government’s very ability to impose environmental regulations—making it harder, if not impossible, for future Democratic presidents to take decisive action on the environment. “They want to not just do what other Republican administrations have done, which is weaken regulations,” Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program head Jody Freeman told the New York Times. “They want to take the federal government out of the business of regulation, period.”

This is par for the course from an administration that is hostile not just to efforts to fight climate change, but to the kind of green energy that will power the future—and that is already powering the present in much of the world. Renewables are overtaking coal and gas, and the market for green energy is exploding. There are enormous economic opportunities here, ones that President Joe Biden put America on the path to enjoying; before Trump took office, many people, especially in red states, were already cashing in. Trump has walked back many of these gains, squandering billions of dollars.

You might have read about the dystopia of super-polluted cities like Delhi, where the city always seems to be shrouded in dust, and you don’t see the sun for days. But here, I think the evenings are the strangest. The streetlights illuminate what looks like fog, and you can see little particles of dust and debris swirling around. I always think: Oh, that’s going directly into my lungs.

My days are set by my AQI app. I prefer to work in my favorite café down the street—Hanoi has famously exceptional coffee culture—but it doesn’t run air purifiers, and so if the AQI is dangerously high, I stay home. On the few times I have risked it, I’ve come home nauseous, and with a pounding headache, itchy red eyes, and lungs that feel inflamed and like they won’t quite fill up all the way. The app I use has a little cartoon person to illustrate each level of danger. On green days, he smiles. On yellow (moderate) days, he’s neutral; orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) days, he frowns; red (unhealthy) he wears a mask; purple (very unhealthy) he dons a respirator; and when it’s maroon (hazardous), he has on an even more serious respirator and looks extremely alarmed—this means the AQI is over 300, “a health warning of emergency conditions,” which means that “the entire population is likely to be severely affected,” according to the IQAir app. (I keep New York on my AQI app too: It’s almost always green.)

People in Hanoi aren’t living like this for fun. Vietnam is something of an economic miracle, with a stunning rate of economic growth. It has rapidly industrialized, which has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty. Those people then buy motorbikes, build houses, and work in newly constructed factories (go ahead and check how many of your most recent Amazon orders, whatever they were, were made in Vietnam). Pollution from the traffic, factories, and construction is all severe; the benefits of all of these things are also extraordinary in a country that was ravaged by war just a few decades ago. There are certainly ways for countries to develop sustainably; it seems questionable whether there are ways for countries to rapidly industrialize and develop at a cheetah’s pace and not seriously degrade the environment in the process. Here, though, the calculus is complex. Yes, the air pollution is horrible, and kills some 60,000 people every year. But in the early 1990s, close to four in five Vietnamese households were living in extreme poverty. Now, extreme poverty is inching toward zero. That is even more life-saving.

And while it’s far from perfect, the government here is in fact trying to implement environmental regulations to protect the country’s diverse ecology, clean up the air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Americans are not living under a similar calculus. We don’t have to choose between economic prosperity and a livable country (not to mention a livable planet). We can move toward even greater prosperity by investing in future-forward clean energy sources. We can be good stewards of a spectacular country, with its plains and canyons and mountains and deserts, as well as its vibrant cities.

At this moment, however, we’re simply choosing not to. Trump has said he supports clean air but not efforts to address climate change, but the two are inextricable. The move from fossil fuels to green energy is not only a must for greenhouse gas reduction, it’s a huge part of reducing the kind of conventional pollutants that continue to degrade our air quality—and our lungs.

A small handful of people are making a whole lot of money in sticking with the old dirty energy sources. This administration has intentionally set back progress on wind and solar projects, as well as on the electric vehicles that much of the world is transitioning over to, in order to prop up a few wealthy tycoons at the expense of the rest of us. And of course the burdens are not felt equally. This is certainly true where I live: I have the resources to buy good air purifiers, a job that lets me work from home, the money to take a taxi rather than a motorbike if I want to get somewhere, and the knowledge of the dangers and how to mitigate them (for example: burning through half a dozen rolls of winterizing tape to seal every door and window so less of the bad air can get in). That’s not the case for huge swaths of the population here, and certainly not for the people whose entire livelihoods revolve around dealing with the trash and pollutants that are the cost of development. In the U.S., low-income residents, as well as Black, Latino, and Asian Americans, are disproportionately exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than white and wealthier Americans, which contributes to illness and premature death. Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” is notorious for industrial pollution that lays waste to the human population—and the people who live closest to the industrial plants tend to be Black and poor.

Even with this decimation of environmental regulations, America’s largest cities are unlikely to regularly find themselves on the most-polluted lists. But the air pollution you can see is far from the only risk to your health, your community, other human beings, and the future of life on our planet. As someone who checks the AQI like it’s the weather, I am genuinely, profoundly flummoxed by those who invite in environmental degradation and the destruction of what makes so much of this world so beautiful—and who, in the name of politics or profit, are so willing to burn the future.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/13/ai_memory_router_prices/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prices for memory used in routers and set-top boxes are surging nearly sevenfold thanks to AI, raising fresh fears that the industry&#39;s silicon binge could leave telcos scrambling to get customers online.

Fresh analysis from Counterpoint Research suggests the cost of memory used in consumer hardware has shot up more than 600 percent over the past year as chipmakers quietly steer production towards higher-margin AI infrastructure. The knock-on effect is being felt most sharply in broadband kit, where DRAM and NAND prices are climbing far faster than in smartphones or PCs.

&quot;Over the last nine months, smartphone memory prices jumped 3x, but the prices for &#39;consumer memory&#39;-based broadband products jumped almost 7x,&quot; Counterpoint said. &quot;Routers are hit the hardest, especially for OEMs with an unsecured supply and weaker negotiating power.&quot;

That leaves some of the telecoms industry&#39;s least glamorous hardware suddenly front and center in supply chain planning. Routers and TV boxes, once the sort of commodity gear telcos handed out like branded pens, are getting noticeably more expensive to build. In some low to mid-range models, memory alone now accounts for more than a fifth of total manufacturing costs, up from about 3 percent just a year ago.

None of this is happening in isolation. Memory shortages are already rippling through the PC market, with vendors warning of price increases and softer shipment volumes as suppliers prioritize chips for AI servers over everyday hardware.

Some of this squeeze is self-inflicted, according to Counterpoint. Telcos have spent the past couple of years adding AI-style smarts to home gateways, which means newer devices need noticeably more memory. Unfortunately, that pushes them into the same component market as hyperscale datacenters – and they don&#39;t tend to win those bidding wars.

Counterpoint reckons the consequences could stretch beyond hardware margins. Broadband rollout plans could face delays or higher procurement costs, with tight memory supply expected to persist through at least mid-2026, even if prices stop climbing as aggressively.

For customers, the fallout may creep in gradually in the form of pricier routers or slower upgrades to newer connectivity tech. For the industry, though, the broader warning is already obvious. AI may be sold as the future of computing, but right now it is also quietly reshaping semiconductor economics – and making the unglamorous business of getting people online more expensive than anyone expected. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The next blackout to plunge a G20 nation into chaos might not come courtesy of cybercriminals or bad weather, but from an AI system tripping over its own shoelaces.

Analyst firm Gartner warned this week that misconfigured artificial intelligence embedded in national infrastructure could shut down critical services in a major economy as soon as 2028, delivering the kind of disruption usually blamed on hostile governments or catastrophic natural events. The prediction centers on the rapid adoption of AI in cyber-physical systems, which Gartner defines as &quot;systems that orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking, and analytics to interact with the physical world (including humans).&quot;

Gartner&#39;s warning isn&#39;t really about attackers taking over AI tools – it&#39;s about what happens when everything is working as intended... until it isn&#39;t. More operators are allowing machine learning systems to make real-time decisions, and those systems can respond unpredictably if a setting is changed, an update is pushed, or flawed data is entered.

Unlike traditional software bugs that might crash a server or scramble a database, errors in AI-driven control systems can spill into the physical world, triggering equipment failures, forcing shutdowns, or destabilizing entire supply chains, Gartner warns.

&quot;The next great infrastructure failure may not be caused by hackers or natural disasters but rather by a well-intentioned engineer, a flawed update script, or a misplaced decimal,&quot; cautioned Wam Voster, VP Analyst at Gartner.

Power grids are an obvious stress test. Energy firms now rely heavily on AI to monitor supply, demand, and renewable generation. If the software malfunctions or misreads data, sections of the network could go dark, and repairing damaged grid hardware is rarely a quick process. The same creeping automation is turning up in factories, transport systems, and robotics, where AI is slowly taking over decisions that used to involve a human looking mildly concerned at a dashboard.

Gartner&#39;s bigger worry is how quickly AI is being deployed where mistakes don&#39;t just crash software; they break real things. AI is turning up in systems where failures can shut down physical infrastructure, yet the models themselves aren&#39;t always fully understood, even by the teams building them. That makes it difficult to predict how they&#39;ll react when something unexpected happens or when routine updates are released.

&quot;Modern AI models are so complex they often resemble black boxes,&quot; said Voster. &quot;Even developers cannot always predict how small configuration changes will impact the emergent behavior of the model. The more opaque these systems become, the greater the risk posed by misconfiguration. Hence, it is even more important that humans can intervene when needed.&quot;

While regulators have spent years focusing on cybersecurity threats to operational technology, Gartner&#39;s forecast suggests the next wave of infrastructure risk could be self-inflicted rather than adversary-driven. ®

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear-powered datacenters in the US are moving closer as a consortium prepares to build proposed facilities for the Department of Energy (DoE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

At the end of 2025, nuclear developer Deep Atomic submitted its proposal to the DoE to build what it calls the &quot;nation&#39;s first nuclear-powered AI and HPC datacenter campus,&quot; at INL, where commercial nuclear power was pioneered.

While there are already datacenters next to atomic power stations, such as the Cumulus facility in Pennsylvania, now owned by Amazon, the Deep Atomic project aims to build a campus with its own dedicated power plant.

This follows moves by the DoE to colocate datacenters with energy generation facilities on federal land, spurred on by executive orders issued by President Donald Trump about removing barriers to AI development and the energy needed to power it.

The consortium around Deep Atomic includes another nuclear firm, Paragon Energy Solutions, datacenter engineering biz Future-tech, and AI infrastructure firm Moonlite.

Now real estate biz Clayco says that it is providing delivery planning on how the datacenter campus should be designed, engineered, and constructed, to further inform the DoE submission process.

The firm will advise the consortium on aligning design and construction approaches with the operational requirements of running high-density AI workloads.

&quot;Our team is proud to support Deep Atomic and the broader consortium by bringing real-world datacenter delivery experience and execution discipline to help present a buildable, delivery-ready proposal for this groundbreaking, first-of-kind project,&quot; commented Clayco founder and executive chairman Bob Clark.

If the project gets approval, construction is planned to proceed on a phased approach. The datacenter will be completed first, and Deep Atomic hopes operations will commence within 24 to 36 months, using existing grid, geothermal, and solar power already available at the INL site.

The AI compute infrastructure will thus be up and running while Deep Atomic puts its MK60 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) through design certification, fabrication, and commissioning.

Or, as a cynic might put it, the datacenter will still function, even if the SMR turns out to be a dud.

Deep Atomic claims that its MK60 unit will be able to provide 60 MW of behind-the-meter electrical power, but also 60 MW of cooling capacity – a feature designed specifically for AI and HPC datacenters, according to the firm.

We asked Deep Atomic when it expects both the datacenter and atomic plant to be operating, but the answer is likely to be &quot;several years from now.&quot;

&quot;In the nuclear world the game starts very early as there is still a fairly long runway before the realization of SMR or microreactor regulatory approval, availability at scale, and adoption in a broad commercial sense,&quot; Omdia principal analyst for Colocation and DC Building Alan Howard told The Register.

He added that he expected to see the end game of this happening around 2035, but &quot;I hope I&#39;m wrong and it&#39;s sooner.&quot;

Last year, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed his belief that the country would have at least one SMR up and running by July 2026.

A stand-alone nuclear power source serving a stand-alone datacenter with no grid interconnection is &quot;a common vision and likely to come true in the future,&quot; according to Howard, but he said the power delivery market is &quot;evolving and exceedingly complex so how it actually plays out could be quite different.&quot;

&quot;At the end of the day, who knows where we will be on datacenter AI capacity demand in five years; the market is changing quarterly and is so dynamic it&#39;s impossible to get a solid view on the future.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ring has cut ties with Flock, citing resource constraints, mere months after the pair announced a partnership.

The pair spoke of their intention to work together on Ring&#39;s Community Requests feature back in October, but Ring said this week the integration &quot;would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.&quot;

The Amazon-owned smart home company made no mention of it in the announcement, but the cancellation comes at a tricky time following backlash over its recent Super Bowl ad.

Ring had used its 30-second slot to highlight its AI-powered Search Party feature, which recruits Ring devices in a neighborhood to activate when someone triggers a lost pet alert. All the devices switch on to locate the animal and reunite it with their owner.

It&#39;s a cute idea in theory, but when depicted in video, many viewers said they saw Search Party as dystopian, and questioned whether this technology could be used for more nefarious means.

While there&#39;s no suggestion the cancellation is linked to this, it also follows another recently announced (and banned by a few states) Ring facial recognition feature, as well as recent criticism leveled at Flock by privacy rights org EFF over its license plate recognition system.

Flock manufactures video cameras, gunshot and audio detectors, and license plate readers, all of which are widely used by US police forces. Recent reports also indicate that this leads to database searches that inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity.

It should be said that Flock recently addressed these concerns, saying that it has no partnerships with ICE or the Department of Homeland Security, and that ICE does not have direct access to Flock-captured footage.

However, the American Civil Liberties Union previously pointed out, citing a 404 Media probe, that many police searches of Flock camera footage are carried out on behalf of ICE agents.

That reportedly includes ICE agents working for the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, which has been violently arresting suspected illegal immigrants on the streets of the US for months by order of President Trump. The same ICE officers have been linked to multiple killings following detention attempts under the division&#39;s orders.

Ring assured customers that none of its video footage was ever sent to Flock between the initial partnership announcement and this week, when that deal was folded up.

It stated: &quot;Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration. The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

&quot;At Ring, our mission has always been to make neighborhoods safer. That mission comes with significant responsibility – to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.&quot;

Flock said that an engagement period, during which the two companies consulted customers, public officials, and communities about expectations regarding accountability, transparency, and lawful use, led to the decision.

&quot;Technology plays a powerful role in helping communities prevent and solve crime,&quot; said Garrett Langley, founder and CEO at Flock Safety. &quot;But that impact only matters if it strengthens trust and aligns with local community expectations.

&quot;Our priority is ensuring that every tool we build and deploy reflects the standards our customers and their communities expect. Right now, that means staying focused on local innovation and disciplined, responsible growth.&quot;

Ring said that it still plans to push on with Community Requests, a feature that allows customers to share footage with law enforcement if they issue a request. Customers are free to ignore these.

Announced in September 2025, Community Requests followed the January 2024 shuttering of Ring&#39;s Request for Assistance (RFA) feature. They&#39;re both very similar, allowing police to request footage from users, with the main difference being that Community Requests involves Axon for secure evidence handling.

Footage goes to Axon, which hands it over to law enforcement, provided the request comes with some information about why it was made.

If the partnership went ahead, Flock would have been the second third-party company to handle Community Requests after Axon – an intermediary between user footage and public safety organizations. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI bubble continues to inflate with Anthropic&#39;s announcement of $30 billion in Series G funding at a $380 billion post-money valuation.

The figures offer insight into the mentality of investors in AI platforms. Anthropic, like its rival OpenAI, has yet to turn a profit, although there are hopes that it will do so any moment now. Investors continue to surf a wave of expected returns. The outfit is heavily burning cash to fund AI model development — and has made billions in headline compute and infrastructure commitments.

Anthropic began generating revenue less than three years ago. Its announcement said: &quot;Today, our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.&quot;

A chunk of that is being driven by Claude Code, the company&#39;s agentic coding model. The company stated that business subscriptions to the service have quadrupled since the start of 2026, and enterprise usage accounts for more than half of all Claude Code revenue.

According to a February report, 4 percent of GitHub public commits are authored by Claude Code. The same report optimistically reckons that Claude Code will account for more than 20 percent of daily commits by the end of 2026.

Such projections warrant caution. Developers are unlikely to surrender production workloads – or even personal projects – to machine-generated code without debate. The bigger question is what Anthropic will ultimately need to charge to deliver returns for investors.

Then there is code quality. Recently, Anthropic&#39;s Claude Opus 4.6 spent $20K to produce a partly functional C compiler. A researcher characterized the resulting Rust as &quot;reasonable&quot; but &quot;nowhere near&quot; expert level.

Ads won&#39;t bolster the company&#39;s revenues in the same way as planned by its rivals. Anthropic has committed to keeping advertising out of the Claude model family, even as it has run marketing campaigns joking about the idea of inserting ads into chatbot conversations.

That said, OpenAI is unlikely to be too worried about Anthropic&#39;s barbs. Last year, it achieved a nominal value of $500 billion, a figure that could hit $750 billion or more in 2026. As 2025 drew to a close, SoftBank announced it had invested another $22.5 billion in the company. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">United Launch Alliance&#39;s Vulcan Centaur reached orbit on February 12 despite &quot;a significant performance anomaly&quot; that saw one of its four solid rocket boosters burn through its nozzle during ascent.

Viewers of the launch from Cape Canaveral at 0422 EST (0922 UTC) were treated to some impressive fireworks as the part detached in a shower of fragments.

It was the fourth launch of ULA&#39;s replacement for the Atlas V and Delta IV rocket, and the second in which an anomaly was noted with the booster. A nozzle was shed during the second launch of the rocket in 2024 in a configuration featuring twin solid rocket boosters, although all appeared to go well on the third in 2025.

Despite the anomaly, the mission was a success, and the US Space Force payload was carried directly to geosynchronous orbit.

ULA planned to ramp up Vulcan Centaur operations in 2026, with future launches including payloads for Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper). It is not clear if those will need to be postponed while ULA investigates the cause of the burn-through and subsequent loss of at least part of the rocket nozzle.

Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Atlas and Vulcan Programs, said in a statement: &quot;We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission.&quot;

The Vulcan Centaur is a heavy-lift vehicle, with a pair of Blue Origin BE-4 engines powering the first stage and up to six GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters providing additional thrust.

The anomaly caused asymmetric thrust, which the rest of the rocket counteracted, allowing it to deliver the payload as planned.

ULA was not the only company launching a new-ish rocket on February 12. Arianespace conducted the launch of the first four-booster configuration of its Ariane 6 rocket at 1645 UTC. The launch went ahead without incident and the rocket deposited 32 Amazon Leo satellites into orbit. ®

            <div id="article-text">Driven by both institutional mistrust and the need to go viral, Epstein theories are clogging up TikTok.

Driven by both institutional mistrust and the need to go viral, Epstein theories are clogging up TikTok.

“where are you? Are you ok , I loved the torture video,” reads one email, allegedly sent by Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. The reply, from a redacted address, states: “I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may.”

Her face hovering over a screenshot of the exchange, a TikTok creator claims the timing aligns with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s schedule, before speculating that the word “torture” could refer to documented abuses of Palestinian detainees. The video has drawn close to 700,000 views.

Another TikTok pushes back. Netanyahu met Chinese officials in Jerusalem — not Beijing — during that period, the second creator notes, his head resting on a pillow. The flight itinerary of the British politician Peter Mandelson flashes onto the screen, then cuts to a news clip of Sen. Lindsey Graham visiting Beijing. Graham once used a BlackBerry, that TikToker adds, pointing to the email’s “Sent from my BlackBerry” signature as potential evidence.

“Somebody is going to unearth something that’s going to crack it open,” he tells viewers.

In the comments, speculation metastasizes. “It was Bill Gates,” one user writes. “my instinct says musk,” adds another. A third replies: “No your prejustice does.”

No one was right; the address belonged to Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.

The latest trove of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice includes over 3 million documents, images, and videos obtained from probes into sex trafficking allegations against the financier and convicted sex offender. Despite heavy redactions, the files appear to bear witness to a degenerate ruling class for whom the law was optional, either partaking in or willfully ignoring his sex trafficking enterprise.

TikTok creators have swarmed the files. Thousands of clips — amassing millions of views — attempt to decode cryptic emails, dig around FBI tips, and theorize on redacted names. In the comments, people swap file numbers and repeat the call to arms: “We are unredacting.” Creators span the political spectrum and descend from various niches: true-crime enthusiasts, news junkies, conspiracy theorists, mom bloggers, wellness gurus.

The #EpsteinFiles tsunami collapses the boundaries between digital vigilantism, conspiratorial thinking, and the warped incentives of the attention economy. Whether this visibility will translate into legal accountability remains unclear. Yet beneath the spectacle lies something harder to dismiss: a genuine groundswell of outrage at the abuses detailed in the files, held together by an overarching sense that traditional justice isn’t coming, even as Congress begins reviewing the unredacted files.

Long before online sleuths began combing through the files, powerful institutions had already shown a tendency to look away.

Epstein reportedly left a severed cat’s head and a bullet on the doorstep of Vanity Fair’s editor-in-chief in the early 2000s to scare off coverage of his abuse. At ABC News, anchor Amy Robach was recorded in 2019 saying the network had “quashed” her earlier Epstein investigation (ABC claimed that there was not sufficient corroboration for broadcast), and critics have argued that initial coverage by The New York Times downplayed the scope of Epstein’s network and the systemic failures that enabled him. So, when Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown first approached former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter in 2017 about his Epstein investigation, he was unresponsive. It’d been 12 years since he’d opened the case.

“He was convinced that a lot of media had squashed the story and he was fed up,” she told WNYC. “Somebody’s going to call your publisher and the next thing you know you are going to be assigned to the obituaries department,” she said she recalled him saying.

But Brown persisted. Her 2018 investigation revealed that Epstein had abused dozens of underage girls and secured a secret, extraordinarily lenient 2008 plea deal that shielded him from federal prosecution, exposing systemic failures within the justice system. The latest files show the FBI received 290 tips relating to Epstein and his associates, and even considered charging co-conspirators but didn’t.

Her reporting led to the arrests of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on new sex trafficking charges in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

To this day, Maxwell is the only person who has been charged in connection with the network, and she refused to answer questions in deposition before Congress on Monday, vowing to talk, and clear President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, only if he grants her clemency.

Despite Brown’s intrepid work, years of ignored police appeals have fed a broader suspicion that institutional newsrooms shield the powerful. That mistrust is measurable: Less than a third of Americans say they trust newspapers, television, and radio to report the news “fully, accurately and fairly,” according to a 2025 Gallup poll.

Into that vacuum, social media has stepped, not just as a forum for commentary, but as a heretic newsroom — one primed to treat any perceived conflict of interest as proof of collusion.

The DOJ’s latest release appears to show emails between celebrity doctor Peter Attia — who CBS News recently appointed as a new correspondent — and Epstein. In one message, Attia seemingly wrote: “Pussy is, indeed, low-carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”

Creators were quick to surface the emails and point out Attia’s recent media ties.

“I don’t think mainstream media will report on the stuff that we’re reporting on social media, because at the top, they’re all connected with the same people,” claims Nemo, a New England-based creator who asked to be identified by his first name.

The question of trust aside, the smartphone-wielding public outnumbers dwindling journalists. The same week of the release, The Washington Post announced it was laying off one-third of its editorial staff, the latest in a flurry of newsrooms to reduce its workforce. Plus, reporters face a higher journalistic standard, giving creators the advantage of speed for posting claims, both founded and completely unverified. Accelerating the urgency of social media posts is paranoia about the sudden, sporadic disappearance of files from the DOJ database.

“Frankly, there’s just too many files [for reporters]”, says TikTok creator Mick McElhinney, 36, from Syracuse, New York, who spends three or four hours reviewing the files daily.

“I had to stop reading these major institutions because I realized they were way behind the ball,” he says.

But, for better or for worse, TikTok content creators tend to be unmoored from journalistic standards and legal risks, so their content isn’t simply surfacing who features in the files.

For example: Broadcast from the car, one creator speculates that there’s a connection between journal entries from an alleged rape victim mentioning private-equity investor Leon Black and an ongoing lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted a minor, claims which he denies. Another line of inquiry: Creators are attempting to locate Epstein’s last girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, a 36-year-old Belarusian dentist. Documents reveal that two days before his death, Epstein gave $100 million to Shuliak.

This kind of sleuthing is known as digital vigilantism — a form of crowdsourced justice-seeking that relies on the “weaponization of visibility”: broadcasting a target’s personal details online for reputational harm.

But while this kind of sleuthing can result in actual justice (see, for instance, the internet detectives who hunted a cat-killer in the Netflix documentary Don’t F**k with Cats), there are examples like Sunil Tripathi. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, Tripathi, a 22-year-old Brown University student, found himself the object of the subreddit r/FindBostonBombers. What started with grainy surveillance footage escalated to false viral tweets announcing that police had identified Tripathi as a suspect. In fact, Tripathi had died by suicide more than a month before the bombing.

What began with the FBI asking the public for clues “morphed into a much uglier digital witch hunt, one where the crowd’s fears, prejudices, and suspicions were given credence,” Forbes wrote at the time.

Unlike that case, however, the DOJ’s Epstein files document the state’s failure to prosecute perpetrators — both in what they contain and the very act of their release. Rather than usurp law enforcement, Epstein vigilantes would argue they’re doing detective work the DOJ won’t. And unlike Tripathi, the individuals TikTok sleuths target are elites, inverting the power dynamic of one man against an angry mob.

In some ways, this activity echoes the internet’s founding philosophy: to function as a “society against the state,” encouraging the “overthrowing of hierarchies,” as French sociologist Benjamin Loveluck writes.

In the case of Epstein, “the issue of accountability must be tackled by the masses,” as put by the authors of a recent article published in the Pakistani Journal of Regional Studies Review examining the files as a remedy for governance flaws. Public scrutiny — including what they describe as “digital activism” — ensures that “no human, wealthy or mighty, can escape examination,” they bullishly argue.

The risk, however, may be uneven accountability as a result of how the files are released.

The Epstein files have been heavily redacted by the DOJ, and there’s no telling exactly who exchanged some of these emails with the infamous sex offender.

“New Brazilian just arrived, sexy and cute, 19yo,” a 2013 email to Epstein reads, sent from someone at a Paris modeling agency — but the sender’s name was redacted. An anonymous sender thanks Epstein for a “fun night” in 2014, adding: “Your littlest girl was a little naughty.”

The redacted dossier “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) wrote on X in December, following the first release.

The gaps leave room for speculation, from the informed to the outlandish, with their plausibility left to viewers to determine. For example, one theory circulating on TikTok claims the DOJ allegedly used “control+f” redacting of “Don T” based on what appears to be a redaction of the word “don’t.”

A list of alleged co-conspirators from a 2019 FBI investigation is unevenly redacted — leaving TikTok to throw out names in an attempt to fill in the gaps.

This blend of shocking revelations and cryptic redactions means that the line between interrogation and conspiracy is blurring.

In one email exchange, Epstein brags about his “aquarium full of girls,” adding: “some are like shrimp , you throw away the head and keep the body.”

One creator, armed with a handheld mic and ring light, speculates that this implies the decapitation of a victim, in a video watched 1.3 million times. “It was a cannibal holocaust,” the caption reads. In the comment section, some suggest it’s “clearly a joke” about only caring for the body, not the person, prompting dozens of replies like “wake up…they ate babies.” These exchanges are typical across “#epstein” TikTok.

It’s emails like these that feed into other theories. Hundreds of clips speculate that mentions of “pizza” and “grape soda” are coded words for pedophilia; supporters of the debunked “pizzagate” conspiracy theory claim vindication. Meanwhile, dozens of TikToks surface the same clips of Epstein with facial blisters, with green screen talking heads suggesting it’s evidence of kuru, a fatal disease caused by cannibalism. The more likely explanation? Herpes.

One of these clips has 7.5 million views. In two videos, different creators recite identical stories claiming their dad knew someone with kuru.

Other rumors include: Did Maxwell abduct missing British girl Madeleine McCann? Are those tables pictured built from babies? What about the lamps — could they be made of human skin?

Adding to the mix is the distribution of AI and false files, pulled from various corners of the internet. An image of raw chickens and a dead body on a cutting board has been viewed millions of times — despite being a piece of art from 2003. False AI-generated images appeared to show New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani as a child with his mother and Epstein, originating from a parody X account.

“There’s very explicit, damning things, there’s things that might be dark humor, there’s things that could be lies, and then there’s just a lot of really weird conversations that are divorced from the context in which they were produced,” says Alice E. Marwick, director of research at Data & Society. “It is very easy to misinterpret anything online when the utterance is divorced from intent.”

“It is very easy to misinterpret anything online when the utterance is divorced from intent.”

While these theories may be outlandish, such theorizing also makes sense. The files blend oddities — an in-house dental chair — with flashes of real horror, like an anonymous email with a redacted image attached that simply states “Age 10.” Suddenly, the unthinkable feels within reach.

The viral speculation surrounding the 2021 disappearance and homicide of Gabby Petito illustrates how crowdsourced justice on TikTok can slip into chasing engagement.

“While some videos prompted calls to police, many users shared speculation in hopes of being first to crack the case — and earn praise for doing so,” writes Bethan Jones of Cardiff University in a 2022 article about the Petito case published in The International Journal of Communication Ethics.

The TikTok algorithm works by boosting the most shock-factor content, rewarding virality over truth. This ensures that “scores of these videos are pushed into users’ ‘for you’ pages regardless of whether the person posting the video is involved in the case, is providing accurate information or is simply furthering a conspiracy theory,” Jones adds.

“The algorithm forces you to make a certain type of content, otherwise nobody would ever see it,” admits Shelli Fleming, 36. The Missouri mom of four spends up to eight hours a day sifting through the files hunting for TikTok content. Her primary goal is “advocacy for the victims,” while also “challenging whatever the mainstream narrative is,” she says.

“It’s hard, though, because in a certain aspect, I have to create content that is going to get views.”

“I have to create content that is going to get views.”

When Fleming first started her channel last summer, covering “true crime, cold cases, stuff like that,” the goal was to make money, she says.

“To monetize one-minute-long videos, it has to be pretty intriguing,” she says. Her Epstein videos speculating on what the files reveal have amassed over 5 million views and generated thousands of dollars.

“People keep coming back for it,” she says.

In addition to the risk of spreading conspiratorial thinking, turning the files into short-form video content risks retraumatizing the victims and profiting from their abuse.

Across TikTok, creators are distributing intimate images, videos, and descriptions of victims without their consent. Survivors have voiced outcry over the many instances in which the DOJ has failed to redact their identities.

Some creators have tried to identify a redacted image of a young girl they believe is the daughter of a high-profile couple in Epstein’s orbit. After finding the now-adult woman they speculate once sat on Epstein’s lap, sleuths have begun posting unsolicited comments on her social media — effectively dragging a private citizen into a viral investigation without evidence or consent.

TikTok’s algorithm also rewards content that shocks and angers, meaning the most graphic files receive the most engagement — lucrative for whoever uncovers them first.

Sociologist Nicole Bedera, author of On the Wrong Side and cofounder of the anti-violence consulting group Beyond Compliance, disagrees that this approach leads to accountability.

“When people see really violent content, they will pause for a moment before they move off of it, even if they don’t want to consume it, as sort of a trauma response to what they’re seeing. Those types of videos are not going to be the ones that lead to any kind of reckoning,” she says. Bedera recommends consuming Epstein content only from creators with a track record covering sexual violence.

Yet woven through the mass circulation of diary entries, body parts, and police reports is a genuine desire from many creators to use visibility as a form of retroactive justice — a collective want to excavate truth from systemic corruption. For participants, this work feels meaningful: a decentralized investigation driven by outrage and a dream of accountability.

“But for this type of vigilantism to work, it can’t just be throwing a name out there and hoping that the right thing will happen,” says Bedera. Instead, she argues, a coordinated online movement must be directed toward removing high-profile perpetrators from positions of power, not just exposing them.

The concern is that the online whirlwind of rage won’t be channeled in ways that translate into justice offline. Much of the content reflects a tone of deep institutional mistrust and disenfranchisement.

Creator McElhinney, from Syracuse, says watching the surge of federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota — including the shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents that has driven nationwide protests — was one of his motivations for creating Epstein-related content. To him, these are not isolated phenomena but symptoms of the same political corruption and elite impunity.

“The bad actors are the ones that are in control of the prosecutors,” he says. “The people of this country are not treating this information as prosecutorial evidence — they’re treating it as intel in a low-grade war, where things are already boiling over.”

Marwick, who studies how conspiracy theories spread online, says the current political climate — shaped by high-profile incidents of federal force and ongoing public protests — may widen the gulf between online outrage and legal accountability.

“When they’re shooting random American citizens on the street, it’s very hard to believe that there are checks and balances. We live in a time where the rule of law is tenuous, which is scary for those of us who always assume that that was immovable,” she says.

But there are signs some content may already be helping to deliver a reckoning offline. In one TikTok shared Monday night, amassing over 50,000 likes, the creator describes sending a list of file numbers to the members of Congress reviewing the unsealed documents.

On Tuesday, Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-FL) posted callouts across social media asking which files he should view unredacted. His Reddit post, since deleted, received almost 3,000 replies. But among the PDF numbers was skepticism about what comes next.

“Are you going to tell the public any of what you see in the files or is this not going to actually help expose things?” wrote one user. “Please come back after you’ve viewed the files,” urged another.

With lawmakers unveiling redacted names, the question is whether this moment becomes another binge-and-forget true-crime hype that fades away — or the start of the long, bureaucratic grind required for accountability.

“This is a trial-by-media case. I do not believe that people are going to be judicially prosecuted,” Fleming says. “But as long as the public and viewers are still interested in the content, I think it’s worth talking about.”

McElhinney pledges to make broadcasting these crimes “a lifelong task,” in what he considers to be “the worst conspiracy in human history.”

﻿iRobot Safe will now handle data for US customers’ Roomba robot vacuum cleaners.

As part of its acquisition by China-based Picea Robotics, iRobot is creating a new US-based subsidiary called iRobot Safe, which the company says will be “responsible for the protection of US consumer data,” similar to the TikTok deal that was completed last month. iRobot customers in the US will be able to continue using their robovacs as usual, but now their data will be handled by iRobot Safe, rather than the company’s new owner.

In a press release published on January 23rd, iRobot stated that the creation of iRobot Safe is “designed to maintain a clear separation between iRobot’s non-US ownership and its US and other global consumer data.” The new subsidiary will have its own US-based board, CEO, and data security officer. iRobot will also still be based out of its current headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, but is now wholly privately owned by Picea.

The addition of iRobot Safe comes a little over a month after iRobot filed for bankruptcy in December, when it also announced it would be acquired by Picea Robotics, following an attempted acquisition by Amazon that fell through in 2024.

Also on The Vergecast: the Epstein files, ChatGPT ads, and Ferrari EVs.

You can watch Ring’s recent Super Bowl ad and see a cute story about dogs being reunited with their families. You can also watch the very same ad and see the seeds being planted for a massively connected, utterly ubiquitous surveillance system that will end the concept of privacy forever. Maybe you can even see both at the same time.

On this episode of The Vergecast, Nilay and David talk about the Super Bowl ad that worried so many people, why Ring would build a feature like this in the first place, and whether all this surveillance is a feature or a bug. Given that the Ring controversy happened the same week as Google recovered important (and supposedly deleted) footage from Nancy Guthrie’s Nest camera, it seems worth debating what we really want from our security cameras, and what “security” even means in this context.

After that, the hosts turn to yet another week of chaos in the AI industry. A number of important people at companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are quitting their jobs, and issuing dire warnings about the power and peril of AI on the way out. What are we to make of the end of OpenAI’s Mission Alignment team, or the Anthropic safety leader who wrote that “the world is in peril?” There are even tech employees worried about what the advent of chatbot advertising will do to your data, your conversations with AI, and the world. We try to put all the pieces together, and figure out what’s really worth being worried about going forward.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for an extra long installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy (theme music by Michiel Vanhoudt), the latest Siri delays, the forthcoming Ferrari EV, and more.

Valentine’s Day often comes with more pressure than it needs to. At heart, though, February 14th is about showing appreciation for the people you care about in ways that feel thoughtful and sincere. And while big displays of romance can do that, it’s often the quieter, more personal gestures — or a meaningful gift that makes life just a little more enjoyable — that matter most.

Below, we’ve rounded up gift ideas that, in our experience, do just that. Some are practical picks, like a pair of noise-canceling earbuds meant to help you focus or a pair of USB-C hand warmers for those cold, blustery days back east. Others, such as Renpho’s eye massager, are designed for rest and relaxation, while some of our more sentimental picks aspire to create a deeper, more lasting kind of romance.

Whether you’re shopping for your wife, a close friend, a partner, or a girlfriend, these gifts are meant to make that special someone in your life feel seen, cared for, and appreciated — regardless of the day.

The Stranger Things Hellfire Club Personalized Raglan Shirt is a fun, throwback-style gift for fans of the hit Netflix show. Inspired by Eddie Munson’s iconic Dungeons & Dragons club shirt, the cotton baseball tee can be personalized with your giftee’s name or custom text, making it a great pick for anyone who isn’t quite ready to leave Hawkins behind.

Jewelry is a classic V-Day gift, but too often it gets worn once and forgotten. The Oura Ring 4 is different. It both looks great and provides a practical use case, letting you quietly track sleep, activity, and other health metrics (with a subscription). It’s the perfect gift for someone who cares about their health but wants something more discreet — and a little more stylish — than a typical fitness band.

Dyson’s Airwrap i.d. is basically a shortcut to a good hair day. The dryer will automatically adjust the heat, airflow, and timing for your hair based on your app preferences, taking the guesswork out of curling and styling. The special edition kit also includes a presentation case and detangling comb, making it even handier.

If you’re shopping for a known bibliophile who already owns enough books, this roomy tote from the New York Public Library is a good alternative. The durable, 14 x 17–inch bag takes a cue from vintage library cards and is sturdy enough for stowing both hardcover epics and groceries, rendering it a genuinely useful gift that still feels a touch more personal.

The Couples Edition of We’re Not Really Strangers is designed to spark deeper conversations and emotional intimacy through guided prompts and questions. It includes 150 conversation starters designed to help you learn more about your partner — no matter what stage you’re at in your relationship — making it a deceptively personal date night activity.

The Gardyn Studio 2 makes it feel as though you have a master gardener on call. The indoor hydroponic system leverages AI to manage watering, lighting, and maintenance duties, letting you grow everything from herbs to jalapeño peppers year-round. Sure, the AI assistant does require a subscription, but it also includes a selection of new seed pods every month.

Pasta should be a love language by itself — and renowned author/chef Joshua McFadden knows this. His excellent follow-up to Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables is perfect for those with a soft spot for baked ziti or eggplant puttanesca, especially since the cookbook features more than 125 recipes spanning each of the four seasons.

The Polaroid Flip is great for anyone who loves capturing moments the old-fashioned way. It’s inspired by classic Polaroids and produces photos that look similarly “vintage,” only they’re sharper and more focused. Plus, you get modern add-ons like Bluetooth and a companion app for fine-tuning settings, allowing you to make the most of your time shooting.

Quince’s Organic Turkish Waffle Robe delivers spa-like comfort at a relatively reasonable price, regardless of where you wear it. The soft, ultra-absorbent robe is made of long-staple Turkish cotton and is ideal for slipping on after a shower, yet it’s also lightweight enough to wear around the house while you’re getting ready to start the day.

If gifting actual roses feels a little too cliché, Lego’s version makes for a playful alternative. The aptly titled Lego Roses set is both a gift and a 120-piece activity, which culminates in a pair of adjustable rose blossoms. Once finished, they double as decor, the kind that won’t wither within a week or two.

If your valentine spends long days staring at a screen or struggles to wind down at night, the Eyeris 1 can help them rest their tired eyes. The nifty massage mask blocks light while providing gentle heat and rhythmic vibrations, making it easy to unwind at bedtime or take a quick break. It also connects to your phone, so you can play music for a more calming experience.

Breakfast in bed, anyone? Dash’s heart-shaped waffle maker can be used for those lovely syrup-soaked breakfast delights or even some savory hash browns and paninis. If waffle hearts are a bit too lovey-dovey cheesy for you, remember that you can always turn them upside down and use some creative trimming to turn them into something much more… “cheeky.”

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle offers almost everything that makes the Paperwhite our favorite e-reader — including a zippy performance, a sharp 300ppi display, and USB-C support. The lightweight device lacks water resistance, though it does benefit from a more pocketable design, making it a great option for book lovers who are always on the move.

If you’re looking for a healthier alternative to a bottle of wine, For Bitter For Worse nonalcoholic cocktails will provide a similar “kick” without the high calories or hangover. The award-winning mocktails are made from organic raw materials and come in a variety of delicious flavors, ranging from tangy rhubarb and citrus to sweet strawberry and hibiscus.

The latest AirPods are a great gift for just about any iPhone owner. The open-style earbuds integrate seamlessly with other Apple devices, deliver great sound, and carry an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. They also feature surprisingly good noise cancellation — a boon for anyone who wants to tune out pesky distractions.

The only thing better than a thick corduroy hat is a thick corduroy hat with a bird on it. Bird Collective’s embroidered, adjustable caps take a one-size-fits-most approach to fit and feature a selection of feathery friends, including chickadees, sandpipers, kestrels, owls, and the always unassuming red-throated hummingbird.

The SnoozeBand feels tailor-made for the valentine who lives in a noisy apartment or dorm. The headband sports thin speakers that work with any Bluetooth device and offers more than 100 hours of curated sleep sounds, from white noise to meditation exercises. It also offers up to 12 hours of playtime and no annoying prompts.

Paddywax’s jigsaw-inspired candle set includes two soy wax candles designed to fit together like puzzle pieces. They’re available in several colors and scent combinations, and once the wax burns down, each ceramic vessel can be reused as storage or minimalist decor. They make a thoughtful gift on their own, but it’s their potential for a second life that makes them a one-two punch.

If you’re looking for a gift that feels more personal, the Aura Carver might fit the bill. The frame’s 10.1-inch display can showcase photos of you and your partner, from your first date to your anniversary. Images are easy to upload to the cloud using Android or iOS, too, making it simple to revisit old memories or add new ones as they happen.

Azul is a great gift for couples who are looking for a board game they can easily knock out over a cup of coffee. The goal is to accumulate a wealth of points while building an eye-catching mosaic; however, despite the simple premise, there’s a subtle level of depth for those who wish to dig in.

Paper Love’s massive floral card is a great option for those times when a valentine and a pack of Sweet Tarts just won’t cut it. When opened, the pop-up unfolds to reveal a butterfly with flowery accents, which you can leave on full display. The card also includes a small note tag, so you can personalize it with a heartfelt message.

Ocoopa’s UT3 are a thoughtful gift for the valentine who’s always cold. Each USB-C puck can reach up to 126 degrees Fahrenheit and heats up quickly, helping you get warm — and stay warm — for up to eight hours. They’re also thin and light enough that you can easily slip them into a pocket or purse, especially since they snap together via magnets.

The Mini Fleur Frame combines the personal touch of a framed photo with the romance of flowers — minus the whole expiration date thing. At the center is a 2 x 3-inch photo of your choice, flanked by 14 Ecuadorian rose blossoms, each of which should last a year or longer. That makes it far more unique than your standard bouquet or wooden frame.

If you want to score brownie points but spare your hands, the latest Theragun Mini is a no-brainer. The powerful, three-speed massage gun can melt away tension much like Theragun’s beefier models, only it comes in a travel-friendly package that’s far easier to lug around. The assorted attachments and included carrying case just add to the convenience.

A scratch-off Valentine’s Day card is far more creative than your run-of-the-mill valentine from Target. All you have to do is jot down a heartfelt note with a pen or pencil before covering it with the provided sticker, which your giftee can then scratch off to reveal your hidden message. It’s a lot like gifting a lotto ticket, that is, if the odds were always in your favor.

If your valentine has a sweet tooth, the Ninja Creami is the gift that keeps on giving. The versatile machine features seven preset programs, which let you whip up everything from smoothies to high-calorie desserts with the press of a button. It even comes with a 30-recipe starter guide and two 16-ounce pints, so you and your belle can indulge together.

Weighted blankets are calming and great for keeping you warm, but many are too heavy to carry around the house. The Weighted Lap Blanket is a more portable alternative, offering a similar effect in a smaller package that’s closer in size to a throw pillow. It’s ideal for anyone who travels often, works at a desk, or just likes to relax on the couch. Plus, it’s much easier to store, too, making it great for smaller spaces.

The Echo Dot Max strikes a nice balance between practical and fun. It delivers full sound that’s impressive for its size, making it great for listening to music and audiobooks. The Alexa-enabled speaker can also help your giftee stay on top of everyday tasks, serving as an alarm clock, sending alerts, and even acting as a smart home controller.

Bake Smart, Samantha Seneviratne’s delectable cookbook from 2023, contains 100 unique recipes covering everything from linzer cookies and blackberry-rye cream scones to burnt caramel cheesecake. It’s brimming with appliance-free prep methods and ways to use unconventional ingredients, all of which are buoyed by Seneviratne’s easy-to-follow instructions and personal anecdotes.

Not sure what her favorite perfume is? The Sephora Favorites Smells Like Love Sampler Set with a redeemable voucher is a great option, offering nine popular fragrances in travel sizes that your giftee can have fun testing. The real highlight is the included voucher, which they can use to get a slightly bigger version of their favorite perfume from the lineup.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Oura is lobbying for relaxed wearables regulation. It has a point, but is regulation even the problem here?

Oura is lobbying for relaxed wearables regulation. It has a point, but is regulation even the problem here?

This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest gizmos and potions that swear they’re going to change your life. Opt in for Optimizer here.

For the past week, I’ve been thinking about the fact that Oura has gone to Washington.

The Oura Ring has always had an influential clientele, but it’s apparently now a popular accessory in Capitol Hill. Earlier this week, Politico ran a story about how the smart ring maker is lobbying legislators for less wearable regulation. Specifically, the article notes that Oura has floated the idea of creating a “digital health screener” classification for so-called low-risk wearable and health features that would be exempt from the Food and Drug Administration’s clearance process.

Oura CEO Tom Hale actually outlined the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed back in December. In it, Hale contends that wearables don’t fit within the FDA’s current regulatory framework, which broadly divides health tech into two categories: wellness and medical devices.

He has a point. The line between wellness and medical devices isn’t as clear as it ought to be. Wellness features are generally defined by the FDA as for educational or entertainment purposes. As such, they don’t require oversight. For example, features like step counts, sleep quality, or your resting heart rate all fall under the wellness umbrella. The definition of a medical device is also broad. Generally, it refers to a device that is meant to help diagnose, treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate a disease, illness, or condition. They’re classified by risk levels. For example, a tongue depressor is a low-risk device, while a pacemaker is a high-risk one. Wearables typically live in a gray area between wellness and medical devices, and are considered to pose a low-to-moderate risk. Where things get tricky is advanced, diagnostic-adjacent features.

Back in 2018, Apple introduced an EKG sensor to the Apple Watch Series 4. It was a watershed moment in wearables history. Where smartwatches were once an expensive fitness tracking luxury, they morphed into potentially lifesaving devices because now the Apple Watch could potentially flag — though not diagnose — atrial fibrillation. That feature, and many since, required FDA clearance because it could potentially inform medical treatment. So while the Apple Watch in and of itself is not a medical device, it has features that the FDA has said require closer scrutiny to ensure safety.

The problem is that getting FDA clearance is a royal pain in the butt. Wearable makers often have to conduct strict accuracy testing and make sure features are HIPAA-compliant to ensure private, secure health data protocols. Those results have to be presented to the FDA for review. It can take years and several millions of dollars to obtain clearance — resources that smaller companies simply may not have. At CES 2026, I finally saw the taint bandaid — a wearable solution for premature ejaculation that took six years and required multiple rounds of funding to get FDA clearance. The result is you end up with a lot of health tech vaporware.

To avoid this regulatory quagmire, wearable makers often release features under the wellness moniker. That means either nerfing insights to the point where they’re not that useful or accepting that new features will take forever to get to market. If they make it to market.

So, I can see Hale’s point in advocating for a digital health screener category. In the op-ed, Hale describes this as “software features that can warn users of trouble but stop short of diagnoses.” Ideally, he says the new classification would have “clear guidelines” with straightforward labeling, explicit disclaimers, and performance standards for accuracy and reliability.

But, from the consumer standpoint, that’s what FDA clearance already does. FDA-cleared health features always come with warnings that they’re not intended to diagnose conditions or replace a doctor. Going through the process also requires companies to prove safety and accuracy. So what exactly is this difference being proposed here? Hale’s op-ed implies it’s a streamlined process to save companies time and money.

“From the consumer perspective, it should feel the same,” says Dr. Ricky Bloomfield, Oura’s chief medical officer. “We would never expect consumers to have to figure out what FDA categories mean and all that complexity. They just want a product that works reliably, that is accurate, easy to use and helps them improve their health. On the bottom line, it’s up to companies like Oura to work with the FDA to figure out the best path for these products so that we can be very clear about what they do and then get it to them as quickly as possible.”

Bloomfield went on to clarify that the process, in Oura’s view, isn’t meant to obscure or negate vigorous accuracy testing. He says that Oura would continue to publish accuracy metrics from their testing for transparency. Instead, it’s meant to combine some of the rigor of a medical device, with the ease of a lower-risk to accommodate all the ways health tech has evolved in the past decade.

“One of the main points here is that technology is moving so quickly that oftentimes, the FDA can’t move as quickly as the technology does,” says Bloomfield.

I have several concerns. Does adding a third classification actually clarify the difference between wellness and medical devices? I regularly have to explain the difference to readers, laypersons, and sometimes, even seasoned tech experts. I often see people conflating FDA clearance with FDA approval — the former is for moderate-risk medical devices, while the latter is for the highest-risk class and drugs. Adding a third, nebulously different classification? That makes me nervous in an age when wellness influencers often muddle facts but have an incredibly broad reach.

Wearable-induced health anxiety is also a real risk. In Optimizer, I’ve frequently written about the dark side of overloading people with dozens of biomarkers and metrics. That’s without factoring in features that flag hard-to-spot conditions like atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, or hypertension. One study found that 20 percent of wearable users reported feeling “intense fear and anxiety” when receiving an irregular heart rhythm notification, while 15 percent reported feeling “anxious, scared, or concerned” when receiving abnormal heart rate alerts. In another, wearable anxiety spurred a 70-year-old smartwatch user into taking 916 EKG readings in a year.

Some people might say, “Well, anxious people should know better and avoid wearables,” but that’s disingenuous. The marketing narratives all say these devices might save your life. That they can help you live longer and healthier. They might even tell you when you’re about to get sick. Most people would like to avoid death for as long as humanly possible — what’s a little anxiety if a little gadget promises to make that possible?

It’s also alarming to see the narrative that wearables can help individuals “take control” of their health. It’s a concept that RFK Jr. touted widely last year after stating he hoped every American would eventually don a wearable. Self quantification can be helpful. However, it alone isn’t enough to “take control” of your health. Data is nice. You still have to see a doctor. Even if you consider the upsides — faster innovation, continuous monitoring for tricky-to-catch conditions — it’s unnerving to see suggestions for relaxed regulations at a time when we’re asking wearables to do more and more.

Speaking of doctors, I’ve spoken to several in my reporting over the years. The majority appreciate what wearables can do, especially in the research space. I’ve also spoken with plenty who are more skeptical and wary of false positives. But even if everything were perfect, incorporating wearable data into an actual diagnosis or treatment plan isn’t always a straightforward path. I began noticing health issues after I started tracking my data with a Fitbit in 2014. It took 11 years and six doctors for me to actually find proper diagnoses, a physician who took me seriously, and a treatment plan. Mine is far from an extraordinary story.

I’m not saying Oura’s wrong for pointing out a valid problem in the existing clearance process. I’m not even saying its proposal is a bad idea. I’m merely suggesting that perhaps regulation isn’t necessarily the main or only problem here. Good regulation hinges on accurately discerning what is and isn’t a low-risk health feature. To me, the bigger issue is whether we’re losing the plot on how to clearly communicate the difference between wellness and medicine.

Who gets to make that judgment call? Medical experts, lobbyists with deep pockets, or science-challenged wellness hacks who assert beef tallow is an adequate substitute for sunscreen? Tech companies that may want to help make the public healthier, but are ultimately beholden to investors?

I’ll point to a recent scenario with Whoop, another wearable company that Politico says has doubled its lobbying spending. Last summer, the company launched a blood pressure feature. The FDA sent a warning letter, saying the feature’s design was misleading and required clearance. Whoop countered saying it was a wellness feature. Reviewing the feature myself, it seemed to fall in a confusing gray area. Providing high or low blood pressure estimates could mislead customers into thinking they have hypertension (or hypotension). That could lead them to take certain actions, assuming a diagnosis, because Whoop’s marketing made it seem like its algorithm was scientifically validated. At the same time, there were clear disclaimers that this wasn’t a diagnostic tool. Then, in January, the FDA released further guidance saying blood pressure features were fine if they were just simply providing information — in other words, if it were for wellness purposes.

When I ask Bloomfield about this, he says the updated guidance was a step in the right direction but acknowledges that there’s still a lot of discussion left before this becomes a reality. For example, Bloomfield pointed out that January was the first time the FDA guidance on this category has been updated since 2019. One of the areas Oura’s interested in discussing further is the ability for digital screening features to actually name what they’re flagging. For example, Oura’s Symptom Radar feature has to remain vague under the current guidance. Instead of saying “Hey, you’re falling ill,” it can only say “We’re detecting early signs of changes in your health.” Bloomfield maintains that is still useful for consumers, but that a degree of specificity could be helpful for other screening.

“This is an area where even the experts have differing opinions on these things,” he says. “We’re all trying to figure this out together… Healthcare is a team sport and we need to work together to make sure we do the right thing for everyone.”

A lot of what Bloomfield says makes sense, though I strongly believe it’s important for the average consumer to understand what companies mean when they market something as a “wellness” feature versus a medical one. Mulling it all over, it’s clear something needs to change. Wellness as a concept has already been teetering on the edge. I’m afraid it won’t be long before it loses its meaning completely.

Meta’s VR strategy is in a bit of an uncertain place right now, with the company recently cutting many jobs at its Reality Labs, and discontinuing new content drops in beloved experiences like Supernatural. Even so, there’s still a lot of fun to be had with its Meta Quest 3S if you’ve been curious about jumping in. It’s a great entry-level headset, and the 128GB model is available at Walmart with a free copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow for $249 ($50 off), which matches its Black Friday price. Currently, no other retailers are offering this sale price.

The Quest 3S can play the same games as the pricier Meta Quest 3, with Batman: Arkham Shadow and Maestro performing impressively well in our testing. Additionally, you can stream Xbox games with a Game Pass subscription and even wirelessly tether it to a gaming PC to play SteamVR games like Half-Life: Alyx. The Quest 3S is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor that’s in the pricier Quest 3, although its display resolution and optics quality are on-par with the Quest 22. It features full-color passthrough, allowing you to see your surroundings without removing the headset. And, to top it off, it comes with the Quest 3’s Touch Plus controllers.

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money.

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

This is part of our What’s Next series, which looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <h2>Understanding the valuation of intangible assets in tech deals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.
