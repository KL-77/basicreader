            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earthquakes, volcanic eruption, eclipses, meteor showers, and many other natural phenomena have always been part of life on Earth. In ancient cultures that predated science, such events were often memorialized in myths and legends. There is a growing body of research that strives to connect those ancient stories with the real natural events that inspired them. Folklorist and historian Adrienne Mayor has put together a fascinating short compendium of such insights with Mythopedia: A Brief Compendium of Natural History Lore, from dry quicksand and rains of frogs to burning lakes, paleoburrows, and Scandinavian “endless winters.”

Mayor’s work has long straddled multiple disciplines, but one of her specialities is best described as geomythology, a term coined in 1968 by Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano, who was interested in classical legends about Atlantis and other civilizations that were lost due to natural disasters. Her interest resulted in Vitaliano’s 1973 book Legends of the Earth: Their Geologic Origins.

Mayor herself became interested in the field when she came across Greek and Roman descriptions of fossils, and that interest expanded over the years to incorporate other examples of “folk science” in cultures around the world. Her books include The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome’s Deadliest Enemy (2009), as well as Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, & the Scorpion Bombs (2022), exploring the origins of biological and chemical warfare. Her 2018 book, Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology, explored ancient myths and folklore about creating automation, artificial life, and AI, connecting them to the robots and other ingenious mechanical devices actually designed and built during that era.

When her editor at Princeton University Press approached her about writing a book on geomythology, she opted for an encyclopedia format, which fit perfectly into an existing Princeton series of little encyclopedias about nature. “In this case, I wasn’t going to be working with just Greek and Roman antiquity,” Mayor told Ars. “I had collected very rich files on geomyths around the world. There are even a few modern geomyths in there. You can dip into whatever you’re interested in and skip the rest. Or maybe later you’ll read the ones that didn’t seem like they would be of interest to you but they’re absolutely fascinating.”

Mythopedia is also a true family affair, in that illustrator Michelle Angel is Mayor’s sister. “She does figures and maps for a lot of scholarly books, including mine,” said Mayor. “She’s very talented at making whimsical illustrations that are also very scientifically accurate. She really added information not only to the essays but to the illustrations for Mythopedia.

As she said, Mayor even includes a few modern geomyths in her compendium, as well as imagining in her preface what kind of geomyths might be told thousands of years from today about the origins of climate change for example, or the connection between earthquakes and fracking. “How will people try to explain the perplexing evidence that they’ll find on the planet Earth and maybe on other planets?” she said. “How will those stories be told?”

Ars Technica:  Tell us a little about the field of geomythology.

Adrienne Mayor: It’s a relatively new field of study but it took off around 2000. Really, it’s a storytelling that has existed since the first humans started talking to one another and investigating their landscape. I think geomyths are attempts to explain perplexing evidence in nature—on the Earth or in the sky. So geomyth is a bit of a misnomer since it can also cover celestial happenings. But people have been trying to explain bizarre things, or unnatural looking things, or inexplicable things in their landscape and their surroundings since they could first speak.

These kind of stories were probably first told around the first fires that human beings made as soon as they had language. So geomyths are attempts to explain, as I say, but they also contain memories that are preserved in oral traditions. These are cultures that are trying to understand earthshaking events like volcanoes or massive floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, avalanches—things that really change the landscape and have an impact on their culture. Geomyths are often expressed in metaphors and poetic, even supernatural language, and that’s why they’ve been ignored for a long time because people thought they were just storytelling or fiction.

But the ones that are about nature,  about natural disasters, are based on very keen observations and repeated observations of the landscape. They also can contain details that are recognizable to scientists who study earthquakes or volcanoes. The scientists then realized that there had to be, in some cases, eyewitness accounts of these geomyths. Geomythology is actually enhancing our scientific understanding of the history of Earth over time. It can help people who study climate change figure out how far back certain climate changes have been happening. They can shed light on how and when great geological upheavals actually occurred and how humans responded to them.

Ars Technica: How long can an oral tradition about a natural disaster really persist?

Adrienne Mayor: That was one of the provocative questions. Can it really persist over centuries, thousands of years, millennia? For a long time people thought that oral traditions could not persist for that long. But it turns out that with detailed studies of geomyths that can be related to datable events like volcanoes or earthquakes or tsunamis from geophysical evidence, we now know that the myths can last thousands of years.

For instance, the one that is told by the Klamath Indians about the creation of Crater Lake in Oregon that happened about 7,000 years ago—the details in their myth show that there were eyewitness accounts. Archaeologists have found a particular kind of woven sandal that was used by indigenous peoples 9,000 to 5,000 years ago. They found those sandals both above and below the ash from the volcano that exploded. So we have two ways of dating that. In Australia, people who study the geomyths of the Aborigines can relate their stories to events that happened 20,000 years ago.

Ars Technica: You mentioned that your interest in geomythology grew out of Greek and Roman interpretations of certain fossils that they found.

Adrienne Mayor: That really did trigger it, because it occurred to me that oral traditions and legends—rather than myths about gods and heroes—the ones that are about nature seem to have kernels of truth because it could be reaffirmed and confirmed and supported by evidence that people see over generations. I was in Greece and saw some fossils that had been plowed up by farmers on the island of Samos, thigh-bones from a mastodon or a mammoth or a giant rhinoceros. The museum curator said, “Yes, farmers bring us these all the time.” And I thought, why hasn’t it occurred to anyone that they were doing this in antiquity as well?

I read through about 30 different Greek and Roman authors from the time of Homer up through Augustine, and found more than a hundred incidents of finding remarkable bones of strange shape, gigantic bones that were inexplicable. How did they try to explain them? That’s really what got me going. These stories had all been dismissed as travelers’ tales or superstition. But I talked with paleontologists and found that if I superimposed a map of all the Greek and Roman finds of remarkable remains of giants or monsters, it actually matched the paleontological map of deposits of megafauna—not dinosaurs, but megafauna like mastodons and mammoths.

Also, I grew up in South Dakota where there were a lot of fossils, so I had always wondered what Native Americans had thought about dinosaur fossils. It turns out no one had asked them either. So my second book was Fossil Legends of the First Americans. In that case, I knew the geography of all the deposits of dinosaur fossils. I just had to drive about 6,000 miles around to reservations, talking to storytellers and elders and ordinary people to try and excavate the folklore. So I sometimes would read a scientific report in the media and think, “here’s got to be oral traditions about this,” and then I find them. And sometimes I find the myth and seek the historical or scientific kernels embedded in it.

Ars Technica:  What were your criteria for narrowing your list down to just 53 myths?

Adrienne Mayor:  I had to do something for every letter; that was a challenge. A few other authors in the series actually skipped the hard letters. I started out with the hard letters like Q, W, X, Z, Y. My husband says I almost got mugged by the letter Q because I got so obsessed with quicksand. I started talking about writing a book about quicksand because I was so obsessed with sand. There are singing sand dunes.

Ars Technica: There’s been a lot of research on the physics of singing sand dunes.

Adrienne Mayor:  Yes. Isn’t that amazing? There are even some humorous stories. One of my favorites is that Muslim pilgrims in the medieval period would travel to special singing sand dunes between Afghanistan and Iran. When pilgrims would feel the need to relieve themselves, they would try to find some privacy, yet urinating and defecating on the sand dune caused a very loud drum roll sound.

Ars Technica: Your work necessarily spans multiple disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. Has that been a challenge?

Adrienne Mayor: I’ve built my career since my first book in 2000 on trying to write not only to other disciplines, but to ordinary educated readers. Some people think it feels like walking a tight rope, but not to me because I don’t have a canonical academic career. I’m an autodidact, I’m not really an academic. So I have absolutely no problem trespassing in all kinds of disciplines. And I depend on the generosity of all these experts.

Some are from the classics and humanities, but an awful lot of them are from scientific disciplines. I think there’s a big tendency to want to collaborate. It’s just that in academia it’s been difficult because people are siloed. So I feel like I have worked as a bridge between the two. Scientists seem very excited to find out that there are epic poems discussing exactly what they’re studying. Paleontologists were thrilled to discover that people were noticing fossils more than 2000 years ago. So the impulse and the desire to collaborate is there.</div>

            <h2>GPS is vulnerable to jamming—here’s how we might fix it</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/gps-is-vulnerable-to-jamming-heres-how-we-might-fix-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, a Widerøe Airlines flight was trying to land in Vardø, Norway, which sits in the country’s far eastern arm, some 40 miles from the Russian coast. The cloud deck was low, and so was visibility. In such gray situations, pilots use GPS technology to help them land on a runway and not the side of a mountain.

But on this day, GPS systems weren’t working correctly, the airwaves jammed with signals that prevented airplanes from accessing navigation information. The Widerøe flight had taken off during one of Russia’s frequent wargames, in which the country’s military simulates conflict as a preparation exercise. This one involved an imaginary war with a country. It was nicknamed Zapad-2025—translating to “West-2025”—and was happening just across the fjord from Vardø. According to European officials, GPS interference was frequent in the runup to the exercise. Russian forces, they suspected, were using GPS-signal-smashing technology, a tactic used in non-pretend conflict, too. (Russia has denied some allegations of GPS interference in the past.)

Without that guidance from space, and with the cloudy weather, the Widerøe plane had to abort its landing and continue down the coast away from Russia, to Båtsfjord, a fishing village.

The part of Norway in which this interruption occurred is called Finnmark. GPS disruption there is near-constant; problems linked to Russian interference have increased since the invasion of Ukraine.

It’s one of the starkest geographic examples of how vulnerable GPS technology is. But such disturbances happen at a lower level all over the globe. The world’s militaries (including that of the United States) are big culprits, breaking out devices that can confuse or disrupt drones, missiles, and aircraft. But the equipment required to interfere with GPS at a less-than-military level is cheap and accessible and affects other aspects of life: Truck drivers, for instance, use it to look like they’ve delivered cargo on time. Players use it to fool augmented-reality games.

Given all this disruption, more U.S. institutions, from the Department of Defense to the Department of Transportation to the Federal Aviation Administration, are making moves toward alternatives and complements for GPS, though perhaps imperfectly. And the existing system has been undergoing a huge modernization program, introducing better-encrypted signals for military users, more varieties of signals for civilians, and higher-power signals for both to the tune of at least $22 billion. The military’s 2025 budget additionally requested $1.5 billion for more resilient “position, navigation, and timing” programs. Other departments have invested smaller amounts. In October 2025, for instance, the Department of Transportation awarded $5 million total to five companies to develop and demonstrate technologies complementary to GPS.

The update’s goals are to make the system more accurate, and harder to mess with. But as threats increase in frequency and sophistication, more work is necessary. “Sooner or later, we’re gonna see bad things happening here,” said John Langer, a GPS expert at the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit research organization. “So we need to armor up for it before it happens.”

GPS is the invisible spine of society, in more ways than most people realize. It became central quickly after the satellite system, built in the 1970s for the military, was optimized for civilians. “Part of what makes GPS so successful is that it’s ubiquitous and it’s inexpensive,” said Langer.

Losing GPS would mean losing a lot more than Google Maps. The technology is integrated into everything from lights that turn on at sunset to dating apps that match users nearby. Its signals also undergird the electrical grid, cell networks, banking, defense technology, and the movements of robots used in industries like agriculture.

The U.S. government currently has 31 GPS satellites in orbit around Earth, and three other governments have their own systems: Russia made one called GLONASS, China created BeiDou, and the European Union built Galileo; all four systems’ data is available to the international community.

GPS works in a deceptively simple way: Each satellite carries an atomic clock aboard. It broadcasts that clock’s time toward Earth. That signal alone is what’s useful to energy infrastructure and financial transactions. But to get position information, a receiver—in a phone or other device—simply has to pick up signals from at least four satellites. It knows what time those signals were sent, where the satellites were when they sent them, and how long it took the signals to arrive. Through fancy triangulation, the phone (or guided missile) then computes its own location.

Or at least that’s the idea. GPS can be jammed, meaning that someone broadcasts a signal much stronger than that of GPS (which has had to travel across thousands of miles of space, and grows weaker with every meter), drowning the real signal in noise. It can also be spoofed, meaning someone sends out a fake signal that looks just like a GPS blip but indicates an incorrect location or time.

Threats like these were always a possibility—and those who built GPS knew about that problem from the beginning, said Todd Walter, director of the Stanford GPS Lab. “Around 2000 is when people got a little more serious about it,” he said. Hardware and software became cheaper, lowering the barrier to swamping or faking signals.

Problems ticked up when the augmented reality game Pokémon GO came online, in 2016. The game required people to travel to places in real life to win. Turns out, not all of them actually wanted to. “All of a sudden, everyone was interested in spoofing,” said Walter.

Pokémon GO cheaters used low-power devices close to the ground, and so didn’t affect cruising aircraft like Widerøe’s. The game made cheating high-tech and furthered methods and technology for signal scrambling, making it available to non-experts, Walter said. At the same time, spoofing arose in conflict zones, where drone and missile attacks are often guided by GPS. Don’t want to get hit by one? Fool its navigation system. “So now people say, ‘Well, we need to protect ourselves from that,’” said Walter. “And so then you see a huge increase in very powerful jamming and spoofing.”

In Norway, officials have noted that GPS disruptions, while most commonly affecting flights thousands of feet in the air, can also cause issues for police cars, ambulances, and ships. According to Espen Slette, director of the spectrum department at the Norwegian Communications Authority (known as Nkom), the agency has detected GPS jammers near hospitals, which could force life-saving helicopters to redirect to a more distant facility. Nkom has also clocked disruptions that affect agriculture and construction operations, while emergency responders have warned about how problems might home in on emergency beacon devices, like the satellite SOS buttons many people carry in the backcountry or aboard boats. The police’s chief of staff in Finnmark encouraged anyone venturing out to, old-school, carry a map and compass.

“It’s hard to grasp the full effect this has on society,” Slette wrote in an email.

Such widespread disruptions are not isolated to the Russia-adjacent Arctic. There are hotspots in Myanmar, most likely associated with drone warfare in the area; on the Black Sea, publicly associated with Russia, which has denied some cases of GPS interference; and in southern Texas, potentially from drug cartels near the border. A report from OpsGroup, a membership organization for international aviation personnel, found a marked increase in spoofing in 2024. “By January 2024, an average of 300 flights a day were being spoofed,” the report said. “By August 2024, this had grown to around 1500 flights per day.” From July 15 to Aug. 15, 2024, 41,000 flights total experienced spoofing. (While in the U.S., it’s generally illegal for civilians to jam or spoof signals, military-led disruptions during conflict are considered a legitimate and legal use-case.)

The uptick indicates that there’s no going back to a world without disruption hotspots. And that, combined with humans’ dependence on GPS, is why scientists and engineers are working on ways to shore up the system—and develop backchannels so a single-point failure doesn’t come to bite anyone, in conflict or in peacetime.

“There are many ways to mitigate GPS disruptions,” Slette wrote in an email. He suggests setting up devices to use signals from all four international constellations, and to install better receivers and antennas. That’s easier for militaries or infrastructure companies, and hard for people who are just buying the latest model of cell phone and have no control over its innards. But existing backups can tell a given device that something fishy may be up. Planes have inertial navigation systems, which mostly use motion-sensing devices to get an independent measurement; phones do too, and they can also check their data against cell towers, to see if something is off in their GPS signal.

But the U.S. government is worried enough about GPS issues that, across civilian and military agencies, research and development for more robust and resilient systems is ramping up. In March, for instance, the Federal Communications Commission launched a proceeding on GPS alternatives, exploring tools that could be used in addition to or instead of traditional GPS.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the Defense Innovation Unit, meanwhile, are investigating how quantum sensors might help with position, timing, and navigation. The United States’ military branches are also working on their alternative position, navigation, and timing capabilities, and their innovation arms like the Space Force’s SpaceWerx organization are running challenges to support alternative technologies. The Department of Defense acknowledges challenges to GPS and the consequent need to diversify the ways it gets position, navigation, and timing information, noting that it is pursuing the integration of alternative capabilities, according to a statement that public affairs officer Chelsea Dietlin requested be attributed to a Pentagon spokesperson. It is also looking toward working with commercial companies.

Even the Department of Transportation has a strategic plan that includes promoting technologies complementary to GPS. (Undark reached out multiple times to the Department of Transportation to request comment but did not receive a response.) A statement that FAA media relations specialist Cassandra Nolan requested be attributed to an agency spokesperson noted that the FAA is working on a system to detect GPS interference, and that it is working with the Department of Defense on navigation signals and antennas that are more resilient. In addition, the statement noted, the FAA already has “a layered aircraft tracking system that incorporates multiple technologies to guard against threats to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).”

But the newer efforts across government may not be as connected as they could be, according to Dana Goward, president of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group that largely comprises companies working in the GPS-problem space. For one, he said, efforts to bolster military and civilian systems have a fairly strict line between them. And neither has been as effective as he’d advocate: On the military side, plentiful programs exist, but they may not be working together. “It’s not clear if there is any coordination or synergies between the projects or how much senior leader support there is for comprehensive solution sets,” Goward wrote in an email.

On the civil side, Congress mandated in 2018 that a backup to GPS be established, but only experimental systems exist so far. There also have been efforts to repeal the law, with the disputed rationale that funding a single system isn’t feasible and there are better paths toward resilience. Goward contended that the government has hoped the private sector will come up with a usable solution, saving the government from creating one itself.

And companies are coming to cash in on that desire, offering their solutions to both government agencies and other industries. “Our founding hypothesis was ‘let’s take 50 years of lessons learned but throw out the rulebook and do a clean-sheet design of a new GPS system incorporating a couple of fundamentals,’” said Patrick Shannon, CEO of one such company, called TrustPoint. The company, which has hired scientific and engineering experts in signal processing and space, aims to have a fleet of small satellites orbiting much closer to Earth than the current GPS constellation, and transmitting at a higher frequency.

TrustPoint’s satellites, a few of which have already gone to orbit, also send out an encrypted signal—something harder to spoof. With traditional GPS, only the military gets encrypted signals.

Many Russian jamming systems, he said, work tens of kilometers from their ground zero (their ground zero usually being a truck with a generator aboard). But with TrustPoint’s higher-frequency signals, the effectiveness of the jammer goes down by three times, and the circle of influence becomes 10 times smaller, shrinking even more if the receivers use a special kind of antenna that the U.S. government recently approved.

Messing with signals becomes less feasible, given those changes. “They would need exorbitant numbers of systems, exorbitant numbers of people, and a ton of cash to pull that off,” said Shannon.

So far, TrustPoint has launched three spacecraft, and has gotten five federal contracts in 2024 and 2025, totaling around $8.3 million, with organizations like the Air Force, Space Force, and the Navy.

Another company, called Xona Space Systems, is also putting satellites in low-Earth orbit, and has worked with both the Canadian and U.S. governments. The company plans to broadcast signals 100 times stronger than GPS, giving users two-centimeter precision, and making jamming more difficult. The signal also includes a watermark—a kind of authentication that, at least for now, protects against spoofing. They have launched one satellite that’s being tested by people in industries like agriculture, construction, and mining.

TrustPoint’s technology may offer novel defense against the dark GPS arts, but Xona, whose founders met while students at the Stanford GPS Lab, may have an edge anyway: Its signals are compatible with current infrastructure, so no one has to buy a new device. They just have to update their software. “We are not building receivers ourselves,” said Max Eunice, head of marketing and communications. Instead, they’re relying on the billions of earthly devices that already themselves rely on GPS.

Other solutions, like one called SuperGPS, stay closer to the ground. They use radio transmitters on Earth to do the same things GPS satellites do in space. The setup, as demonstrated by scientists at the Delft University of Technology and VU University in the Netherlands, involves scattering radio transmitters around an area or using those already in place. Each transmitter is synchronized to an atomic clock, which sends the time to transmitters via fiber optic cable, which may already be in a place due to existing communications infrastructure. Receivers can collect signals scattered across a wide range of radio frequencies, making it more difficult to jam or spoof them. The team published a proof of concept in a 2022 Nature paper and is working on a second iteration called SuperGPS2.

Tom Powell, another GPS expert at the Aerospace Corporation, said that looking at alternatives and augmentations like these is important—even though GPS recently underwent the 25-year modernization effort, making its own signals more robust to vulnerabilities. “Now that we have delivered, or nearly completely delivered, this modernization, is there a better way to do it in face of the current realities?” he said. He and other GPS experts don’t have answers yet. “We’re just asking questions right now.”

Walter, the director of the Stanford GPS Lab, thinks that whatever a better path looks like, it will likely still include the old-school, original system. “There’s nothing that really does replace GPS,” he said. “I see articles saying ‘post-GPS World’ and so forth. But really, GPS, I think, will always be there.”

People will, and should, strengthen it, Walter added, but that bolstering is going to be piecemeal—efforts may work in a particular region, or they cover some of GPS’s roles (such as providing accurate time) but not others, or they may back up navigation but not be as accurate. They may also cost money. “GPS is free, so that makes it almost impossible to compete with,” he said.

GPS is also straightforward, said Powell. “As satellites go, they’re pretty simple,” he said. They point at Earth, and they transmit signals that tell what time it is. From that, humans get to live in an interconnected, chronologically propriocepted world. Figuring out how to keep it that way, though, is proving a little more complicated.

            <h2>Remembering what Windows 10 did right—and how it made modern Windows more annoying</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/remembering-the-best-and-worst-about-windows-10-on-the-year-it-technically-died/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been following our coverage for the last few years, you’ll already know that 2025 is the year that Windows 10 died. Technically.

“Died,” because Microsoft’s formal end-of-support date came and went on October 14, as the company had been saying for years. “Technically,” because it’s trivial for home users to get another free year of security updates with a few minutes of effort, and schools and businesses can get an additional two years of updates on top of that, and because load-bearing system apps like Edge and Windows Defender will keep getting updates through at least 2028 regardless.

But 2025 was undoubtedly a tipping point for the so-called “last version of Windows.” StatCounter data says Windows 11 has overtaken Windows 10 as the most-used version of Windows both in the US (February 2025) and worldwide (July 2025). Its market share slid from just over 44 percent to just under 31 percent in the Steam Hardware Survey. And now that Microsoft’s support for the OS has formally ended, games, apps, and drivers are already beginning the gradual process of ending or scaling back official Windows 10 support.

Windows 10 is generally thought of as one of the “good” versions of Windows, and it was extremely popular in its heyday: the most widely used version of Windows since XP. That’s true even though many of the annoying things that people complain about in Windows 11 started during the Windows 10 era. Now that it’s time to write Windows 10’s epitaph, it’s worth examining what Microsoft got right with Windows 10, how it laid the groundwork for many of the things people dislike about Windows 11, and how Microsoft has made all of those problems worse in the years since Windows 11 first launched.

Like Windows 7, Windows 10’s primary job was to not be its predecessor. Windows 8 brought plenty of solid under-the-hood improvements over Windows 7, but it came with a polarizing full-screen Start menu and a touchscreen-centric user interface that was an awkward fit for traditional desktops and laptops.

And the biggest thing it did to differentiate itself from Windows 8 was restore a version of the traditional Start menu, altered from its Windows XP or Windows 7-era iterations but familiar enough not to put people off.

Windows 10 also adopted a bunch of other things that people seemed to like about their smartphones—it initially rolled out as a free upgrade to anyone already running Windows 7 or Windows 8, and it ran on virtually all the same hardware as those older versions. It was updated on a continuous, predictable cadence that allowed Microsoft to add features more quickly. Microsoft even expanded its public beta program, giving enthusiasts and developers an opportunity to see what was coming and provide feedback before new features were rolled out to everybody.

Windows 10 also hit during a time of change at Microsoft. Current CEO Satya Nadella was just taking over from Steve Ballmer, and as part of that pivot, the company was also doing things like making its Office apps work on iOS and Android and abandoning its struggling, proprietary browser engine for Edge. Nadella’s Microsoft wanted you to be using Microsoft products (and ideally paying for a subscription to do so), but it seemed more willing to meet people where they were rather than forcing them to change their behavior.

That shift continued to benefit users throughout the first few years of Windows 10’s life. Developers benefited from the introduction and continuous improvement of the Windows Subsystem for Linux, a way to run Linux and many of its apps and tools directly on top of Windows. Microsoft eventually threw out its struggling in-house browser engine for a new version of the Edge browser built on Chromium—we can debate whether Chromium’s supremacy is a good thing for an open, standard-compliant Internet, but switching to a more compatible rendering engine and an established extension ecosystem was absolutely the more user-friendly choice. Both projects also signaled Microsoft’s growing engagement with and contributions to open-source projects, something that would have been hard to imagine during the company’s closed-off ’90s and ’00s.

Windows 10 wasn’t perfect; these examples of what it did right are cherry-picked. But part of the operating system’s reputation comes from the fact that it was originally developed as a response to real complaints and rolled out in a way that tried to make its changes and improvements as widely accessible as possible.

As many things as Windows 10 did relatively well, most of the things people claim to find objectionable about Windows 11 actually started happening during the Windows 10 era.

Right out of the gate, for example, Windows 10 wanted to collect more information about how people were using the operating system—ostensibly in the name of either helping Microsoft improve the OS or helping “personalize” its ads and recommendations. And the transition to the “software-as-a-service” approach helped Windows move faster but also broke things, over and over again—these kinds of bugs have persisted on and off into the Windows 11 era despite Microsoft’s public beta programs.

Windows 10 could also get pushy about other Microsoft products. Multiple technologies, like the original Edge and Cortana, were introduced, pushed on users, and failed. The annoying news and weather widget on the taskbar was a late addition to Windows 10; advertisements and news articles could clutter up its lock screen. Icons for third-party apps from the Microsoft Store, many of them low-rent, ad-supported time-waster games, were added to the Start menu without user consent. Some users of older Windows versions even objected to the way that the free Windows 10 upgrade was offered—the install files would download themselves automatically, and it could be difficult to make the notifications go away.

Even the mandatory Microsoft Account sign-in, one of the most frequently complained-about aspects of Windows 11, was a Windows 10 innovation—it was easier to circumvent than it is now, and it was just for the Home edition of the software, but in retrospect, it was clearly a step down the road that Windows 11 is currently traveling.

But many of Windows 11’s annoyances are new ones. And the big problem is that these annoyances have been stacked on top of the annoying things that Windows 10 was already doing, gradually accumulating to make the new PC setup process go from “lightly” to “supremely” irritating.

The Microsoft Account sign-in requirement is ground zero for a lot of this since signing in with an account unlocks a litany of extra ads for Microsoft 365, Game Pass, and other services you may or may not need or want. Connecting to the Internet and signing in became a requirement for new installations of both the Home and the Pro versions of Windows 11 starting with version 22H2, and while workarounds existed then and continue to exist now, you have to know about them beforehand or look them up yourself—the OS doesn’t offer you an option to skip. Microsoft will also apparently be closing some of these loopholes in future updates, making circumvention even more difficult.

And if getting through those screens when setting up a new PC wasn’t annoying enough, Windows 11 will regularly remind you about other Microsoft services again through its Second Chance Out-Of-Box Experience screen, or SCOOBE. This on-by-default “feature” has offered to help me “finish setting up” Windows 11 installations that are years old and quite thoroughly set up. It can be turned off via a buried checkbox in the Notifications settings, but removing it or making it simpler to permanently dismiss from the SCOOBE screen itself would be the more user-friendly change, especially since Microsoft already bombards users with “helpful reminders” about many of these same services via system notifications.

Microsoft’s all-consuming pivot to generative AI also deserves blame. Microsoft’s Copilot push hasn’t stopped with the built-in app that gets a position of honor on the default taskbar—an app whose appearance and functionality have completely changed multiple times in the last couple of years as Microsoft has updated it. Microsoft changed the default Windows PC keyboard layout for the first time in 30 years to accommodate Copilot, and Copilot-branded features have landed in every Windows app from Word to Paint to Edge to Notepad. Sometimes these features can be uninstalled or turned off; sometimes they can’t.

It’s not just that Microsoft is squeezing generative AI into every possible nook and cranny in Windows; it’s that there seems to be no feature too intrusive or risky to make the cutoff. Microsoft nearly rolled out a catastrophically insecure version of Recall, a feature for some newer PCs that takes screenshots of your activity and records it for later reference; Microsoft gave its security an overhaul after a massive outcry from users, media, and security researchers, but Recall still rolled out.

The so-called “agentic” AI features that Microsoft is currently testing in Windows come with their own documented security and privacy risks, but their inclusion in Windows is essentially a foregone conclusion because Microsoft executives are constantly talking about the need to develop an “agentic OS.” There’s a fine line between introducing new software features and forcing people to use them, and I find that Microsoft’s pushiness around Windows 11’s AI additions falls on the wrong side of that line for me pretty much every single time.

Finally, while Windows 10 ran on anything that could run Windows 7 or 8, Windows 11 came with new system requirements that excluded many existing, functional PCs. The operating system can be installed unofficially on PCs that are several years older than the official cutoff, but only if you’re comfortable with the risks and you know how to get around the system requirements check.

I find the heightened requirements—implemented to improve security, according to Microsoft—to be more or less defensible. TPM modules enable seamless disk encryption, Secure Boot protects from threats that are otherwise invisible and hard to detect, and CPU makers like Intel and AMD only commit to supporting older processors with firmware-level security patches for so long, which is important in the era of hardware-level security exploits.

But the requirements don’t feel like something Microsoft has imposed to protect users from threats; they feel like something Microsoft is doing in order to upsell you to a new PC. Microsoft creates that impression when it shows Windows 10 users full-screen ads for new Copilot+ PCs, even when their systems are capable of upgrading to the new operating system directly. People are already primed to believe in “planned obsolescence,” the idea that the things they buy are designed to slow down or fail just in time to force them to buy new things; pushing people to throw out functioning PCs with full-screen ads does nothing to dispel this notion.

I still believe that Windows 11 has good bones. Install the Enterprise version of the operating system and you’ll get a version with much less extra cruft on top of it, a version made to avoid alienating the businesses that pay good money to install Windows across large fleets of PCs. Microsoft has made huge strides in getting its operating system to run on Arm-based PCs. The Windows Subsystem for Linux is better than it’s ever been. I’m intrigued by the company’s efforts to make Windows a better operating system for gaming handhelds, Microsoft’s belated answer to Valve’s Steam Deck and SteamOS.

But as someone with firsthand experience of every era of Windows from 3.1 onward, I can say I’ve never felt as frustrated with the operating system as I have during Windows 11’s Copilot era. The operating system can be tamed with effort. But the taming has become an integral part of the new PC setup process for me, just as essential as creating the USB installer and downloading drivers and third-party apps. It’s something my PC needs to have done to it before it feels ready to use.

Windows 10 was far from perfect. But as we mark the first stage of its multi-year passing, it’s worth remembering what it did well and why people were willing to install it in droves. I’d like to see Microsoft recommit to a quieter, cleaner version of Windows that is more willing to get out of the way and just let people use their computers the way they want, the same way the company has tried to recommit to security following a string of embarrassing breaches. I don’t have much hope that this will happen, but some genuine effort could go a long way toward convincing Windows 10-using holdouts that the new OS actually isn’t all that bad.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SIM cards, the small slips of plastic that have held your mobile subscriber information since time immemorial, are on the verge of extinction. In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the Pixel 10 series. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google’s new phones. And boy, do I regret it.

SIM cards have existed in some form since the ’90s. Back then, they were credit card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They slimmed down over time, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. Enter, eSIM.

The eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, non-removable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.

Apple was the first major smartphone maker to force the use of eSIM with the release of the iPhone 14, and it makes use of that space. The international iPhone 17 with a SIM card slot has a smaller battery than the eSIM-only version, but the difference is only about 8 percent. Google didn’t make the jump until this year with the Pixel 10 series—the US models are eSIM-only, but they unfortunately don’t have more of anything compared to the international versions.

In advance of the shift, Android got system-level support for downloading and transferring eSIMs. But whatever can go wrong will go wrong, and it’s extremely annoying when eSIM goes wrong.

There have been times when I swapped between phones on an almost daily basis—such was the nature of reviewing phones back when there were a dozen of them coming out every month. Never once in all those countless device swaps did I have a problem with my SIM card. As such, I managed to avoid contacting carrier support for years at a time.

In the three months since Google forced me to give up my physical SIM card, I’ve only needed to move my eSIM occasionally. Still, my phone number has ended up stuck in limbo on two occasions. Android’s built-in tools work better than they used to, and I can’t say what is responsible for the eSIM corruption. However, carriers bear the responsibility for how annoying this is to fix.

The first time, I was logged in to the mobile app for my carrier (T-Mobile). After a few minutes of back and forth with support, I was able to use the app to authenticate and get a new eSIM pushed to the phone. It was annoying but relatively painless. The second time a SIM transfer went sideways, I was not logged in to the app, and that was a problem.

When a mobile carrier needs to verify your identity for an account change, they all do the same thing: send a text message. And what happens if you don’t have a working SIM? That’s right—nothing. Without access to my account or phone number, I was stuck with no way to download a new eSIM. The only course of action was to go to a physical store to download an electronic SIM card. What should have been 30 seconds of fiddling with a piece of plastic turned into an hour standing around a retail storefront.

Many people have had the same phone number for years—even decades at this point. These numbers aren’t just a way for people to get in touch because, stupidly, we have also settled on phone numbers as a means of authentication. Banks, messaging apps, crypto exchanges, this very website’s publishing platform, and even the carriers managing your number rely on SMS multifactor codes. And those codes aren’t even very secure.

So losing access to your phone number doesn’t just lock you out of your phone. Key parts of your digital life can also become inaccessible, and that could happen more often now due to the fungible nature of eSIMs.

Most people won’t need to move their phone number very often, but the risk that your eSIM goes up in smoke when you do is very real. Compare that to a physical SIM card, which will virtually never fail unless you damage the card. Swapping that tiny bit of plastic takes a few seconds, and it never requires you to sit on hold with your carrier’s support agents or drive to a store. In short, a physical SIM is essentially foolproof, and eSIM is not.

Obviously, the solution is not to remove multifactor authentication—your phone number is, unfortunately, too important to be unguarded. However, carriers’ use of SMS to control account access is self-defeating and virtually guarantees people are going to have bad experiences in the era of eSIM. Enshittification has truly come for SIM cards.

If this future is inevitable, there ought to be a better way to confirm account ownership when your eSIM glitches. It doesn’t matter what that is as long as SMS isn’t the default. Google actually gets this right with Fi. You can download an eSIM at any time via the Fi app, and it’s secured with the same settings as your Google account. That’s really as good as it gets for consumer security. Between Google Authenticator, passkeys, and push notifications, it’s pretty hard to get locked out of Google, even if you take advantage of advanced security features.

We gave up the headphone jack. We gave up the microSD card. Is all this worthwhile to boost battery capacity by 8 percent? That’s a tough sell.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the first year of Donald Trump’s chaotic trade war winds down, the tech industry is stuck scratching its head, with no practical way to anticipate what twists and turns to expect in 2026.

Tech companies may have already grown numb to Trump’s unpredictable moves. Back in February, Trump warned Americans to expect “a little pain” after he issued executive orders imposing 10–25 percent tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including Canada, China, and Mexico. Immediately, industry associations sounded the alarm, warning that the costs of consumer tech could increase significantly. By April, Trump had ordered tariffs on all US trade partners to correct claimed trade deficits, using odd math that critics suspected came from a chatbot. (Those tariffs bizarrely targeted uninhabited islands that exported nothing and were populated by penguins.)

Costs of tariffs only got higher as the year wore on. But the tech industry has done very little to push back against them. Instead, some of the biggest companies made their own surprising moves after Trump’s trade war put them in deeply uncomfortable positions.

Right from the jump in February, Apple got backed into a corner after Trump threatened a “flat” 60 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, which experts said could have substantially taxed Apple’s business. Moving to appease Trump, Apple promised to invest $500 billion in the US in hopes of avoiding tariffs, but that didn’t take the pressure off for long.

By April, Apple stood by and said nothing as Trump promised the company would make “made in the USA” iPhones. Analysts suggested such a goal was “impossible,” calling the idea “impossible at worst and highly expensive at best.”

Apple’s silence did not spare the company Trump’s scrutiny. The next month, Trump threatened Apple with a 25 percent tariff on any iPhones sold in the US that were not manufactured in America. Experts were baffled by the threat, which appeared to be the first time a US company was threatened directly with tariffs.

Typically, tariffs are imposed on a country or category of goods, like smartphones. It remains unclear if it would even be legal to levy a tariff on an individual company like Apple, but Trump never tested those waters. Instead, Trump stopped demanding the American-made iPhone and withdrew other tariff threats after he was apparently lulled into submission by a gold statue that Apple gifted him in August. The engraved glass disc featured an Apple logo and Tim Cook’s signature above a “Made in USA” stamp, celebrating Donald Trump for his “Apple American Manufacturing Program.”

Around the same time that Trump eased pressure on Apple, he turned his attention to Intel. On social media in August, Trump ordered Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to “resign immediately,” claiming he was “highly conflicted.” In response, Tan did not resign but instead met with Trump and struck a deal that gave the US a 10 percent stake in Intel. Online, Trump bragged that he let Tan “keep his job” while hyping the deal—which The New York Times described as one of the “largest government interventions in a US company since the rescue of the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis.”

But unlike the auto industry, Intel didn’t need the money. And rather than helping an ailing company survive a tough spot, the deal risked disrupting Intel’s finances in ways that spooked shareholders. It was therefore a relief to no one when Intel detailed everything that could go wrong in an SEC filing, including the possible dilution of investors’ stock due to discounting US shares and other risks of dilution, if certain terms of the deal kick in at some point in the future.

The company also warned of potential lawsuits challenging the legality of the deal, which Intel fears could come from third parties, the US government, or foreign governments. Most ominous, Intel admitted there was no way to predict what other risks may come, both in the short-term and long-term.

Of course, Intel wasn’t the only company Trump sought to control, and not every company caved. He tried to strong-arm the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in September into moving half its chip manufacturing into the US, but TSMC firmly rejected his demand. And in October, when Trump began eyeing stakes in quantum computing firms, several companies were open to negotiating, but with no deals immediately struck, it was hard to ascertain how seriously they were entertaining Trump’s talks.

Trump struck another particularly wild deal the same month as the Intel agreement. That deal found chipmakers Nvidia and AMD agreeing to give 15 percent of revenue to the US from sales to China of advanced computer chips that could be used to fuel frontier AI. By December, Nvidia’s deal only drew more scrutiny, as the chipmaker agreed to give the US an even bigger cut—25 percent—of sales of its second most advanced AI chips, the H200.

Again, experts were confused, noting that export curbs on Nvidia’s H20 chips, for example, were imposed to prevent US technology thefts, maintain US tech dominance, and protect US national security. Those chips are six times less powerful than the H200. To them, it appeared that the Trump administration was taking payments to overlook risks without a clear understanding of how that might give China a leg-up in the AI race. It also did not appear to be legal, since export licenses cannot be sold under existing federal law, but government lawyers have supposedly been researching a new policy that would allow the US to collect the fees.

As the end of 2025 nears, the tech company likely sweating Trump’s impulses most may be TikTok owner ByteDance. In October, Trump confirmed that China agreed to a deal that allows the US to take majority ownership of TikTok and license the TikTok algorithm to build a US version of the app.

Trump has been trying to close this deal all year, while ByteDance remained largely quiet. Prior to the start of Trump’s term, the company had expressed resistance to selling TikTok to US owners, and as recently as January, a ByteDance board member floated the idea that Trump could save TikTok without forcing a sale. But China’s approval was needed to proceed with the sale, and near the end of December, ByteDance finally agreed to close the deal, paving the way for Trump’s hand-picked investors to take control in 2026.

It’s unclear how TikTok may change under US control, perhaps shedding users if US owners cave to Trump’s suggestion that he’d like to see the app go “100 percent MAGA” under his hand-picked US owners. It’s possible that the US version of the app could be glitchy, too.

Whether Trump’s deal actually complies with a US law requiring that ByteDance divest control of TikTok or else face a US ban has yet to be seen. Lawmaker scrutiny and possible legal challenges are expected in 2026, likely leaving both TikTok users and ByteDance on the edge of their seats waiting to see how the globally cherished short video app may change.

The TikTok deal was once viewed as a meaningful bargaining chip during Trump’s tensest negotiations with China, which has quickly emerged as America’s fiercest rival in the AI race and Trump’s biggest target in his trade war.

But as closing the deal remained elusive for most of the year, analysts suggested that Trump grew “desperate” to end tit-for-tat retaliations that he started, while China appeared more resilient to US curbs than the US was to China’s.

In one obvious example, many Americans’ first tariff pains came when Trump ended a duty-free exemption in February for low-value packages imported from cheap online retailers, like Shein and Temu. Unable to quickly adapt to the policy change, USPS abruptly stopped accepting all inbound packages from Hong Kong and China. After a chaotic 24 hours, USPS started slowly processing parcels again while promising Americans that it would work with customs to “implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.”

Trump has several legal tools to impose tariffs, but the most controversial path appears to be his favorite. The Supreme Court is currently weighing whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants a US president unilateral authority to impose tariffs.

Seizing this authority, Trump imposed so-called “reciprocal tariffs” at whim, the Consumer Technology Association and the Chamber of Commerce told the Supreme Court in a friend-of-the-court brief in which they urged the justices to end the “perfect storm of uncertainty.”

Unlike other paths that would limit how quickly Trump could shift tariff rates or how high the tariff rate could go, under IEEPA, Trump has imposed tariff rates as high as 125 percent. Deferring to Trump will cost US businesses, CTA and CoC warned. CTA CEO Gary Shapiro estimated that Trump has changed these tariff rates 100 times since his trade war began, affecting $223 billion of US exports.

Meanwhile, one of Trump’s biggest stated goals of his trade war—forcing more manufacturing into the US—is utterly failing, many outlets have reported.

Likely due to US companies seeking more stable supply chains, “reshoring progress is nowhere to be seen,” Fortune reported in November. That month, a dismal Bureau of Labor Statistics released a jobs report that an expert summarized as showing that the “US is losing blue-collar jobs for the first time since the pandemic.”

A month earlier, the nonpartisan policy group the Center for American Progress drew on government labor data to conclude that US employers cut 12,000 manufacturing jobs in August, and payrolls for manufacturing jobs had decreased by 42,000 since April.

As tech companies take tech tariffs on the chin, perhaps out of fears that rattling Trump could impact lucrative government contracts, other US companies have taken Trump to court. Most recently, Costco became one of the biggest corporations to sue Trump to ensure that US businesses get refunded if Trump loses the Supreme Court case, Bloomberg reported. Other recognizable companies like Revlon and Kawasaki have also sued, but small businesses have largely driven opposition to Trump’s tariffs, Bloomberg noted.

Should the Supreme Court side with businesses—analysts predict favorable odds—the US could owe up to $1 trillion in refunds. Dozens of economists told SCOTUS that Trump simply doesn’t understand why having trade deficits with certain countries isn’t a threat to US dominance, pointing out that the US “has been running a persistent surplus in trade in services for decades” precisely because the US “has the dominant technology sector in the world.”

Justices seem skeptical that IEEPA grants Trump the authority, ordinarily reserved for Congress, to impose taxes. However, during oral arguments, Justice Amy Coney Barrett fretted that undoing Trump’s tariffs could be “messy.” Countering that, small businesses have argued that it’s possible for Customs and Border Patrol to set up automatic refunds.

While waiting for the SCOTUS verdict (now expected in January), the CTA ended the year by advising tech companies to keep their receipts in case refunds require requests for tariffs line by line—potentially complicated by tariff rates changing so drastically and so often.

Looking into 2026, tech companies cannot breathe a sigh of relief even if the SCOTUS ruling swings their way, though. Under a separate, legally viable authority, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on semiconductors and any products containing them, a move the semiconductor industry fears could cost $1 billion.

And if Trump continues imposing tariffs on materials used in popular tech products, the CTA told Ars in September that potential “tariff stacking” could become the industry’s biggest nightmare. Should that occur, US manufacturers could end up double-, triple-, or possibly even quadruple-taxed on products that may contain materials subject to individual tariffs, like semiconductors, polysilicon, or copper.

Predicting tariff costs could become so challenging that companies will have no choice but to raise prices, the CTA warned. That could threaten US tech competitiveness if, possibly over the long term, companies lose significant sales on their most popular products.

For many badly bruised by the first year of tariffs, it’s hard to see how tariffs could ever become a winning strategy for US tech dominance, as Trump has long claimed. And Americans continue to feel more than “a little pain,” as Trump forecasted, causing many to shift their views on the president.

Americans banding together to oppose tariffs could help prevent the worst possible outcomes. With prices already rising on certain goods in the US, the president reversed some tariffs as his approval ratings hit record lows. But so far, Big Tech hasn’t shown much interest in joining the fight, instead throwing money at the problem by making generous donations to things like Trump’s inaugural fund or his ballroom.

A bright light for the tech industry could be the midterm elections, which could pressure Trump to ease off aggressive tariff regimes, but that’s not a given. Trump allies have previously noted that the president typically responds to pushback on tariffs by doubling down. And one of Trump’s on-again-off-again allies, Elon Musk, noted in December in an interview that Trump ignored his warnings that tariffs would drive manufacturing out of the US.

“The president has made it clear he loves tariffs,” Musk said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public. These exotic objects—once thought to be merely hypothetical—have also conceptually inspired countless artists all over the world. A generous sampling of such work is featured in Conjuring the Void: The Art of Black Holes.

Author Lynn Gamwell spent ten years as director of the New York Academy of Science’s Gallery of Art and Science. She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard’s interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown.

“I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,” Gamwell told Ars. “There’s just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.”

Gamwell opens the book by chronologically summarizing key developments in the science of black holes, from Isaac Newton and John Mitchell’s 1783 concept of “dark stars,” to the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and such Nobel Prize-winning discoveries as the LIGO collaboration’s 2016 detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s first image of a black hole in 2019. That discussion provides a springboard to showcase all the examples of black-hole-inspired art Gamwell unearthed during her research, from early 20th century illustrations to cutting-edge contemporary art.

Gamwell sees echoes of Mitchell’s dark stars, for instance, in Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “A Descent Into the Maelstrom,” particularly the evocative 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke. “This seemed to have been an early analogy to a black hole for many people when the concept was first proposed,” said Gamwell. “It’s a mathematical construct at that point and it’s very difficult to imagine a mathematical construct. Poe actually envisioned a dark star [elsewhere in his writings].”

The featured art spans nearly every medium: charcoal sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, oil or acrylic paintings, murals, sculptures, traditional and digital photography, and immersive room-sized multimedia installations, such as a 2021-2022 piece called Gravitational Arena by Chinese artist Xu Bing. “Xu Bing does most of his work about language,” said Gamwell. For Gravitational Arena, “He takes a quote about language from Wittgenstein and translates it into his own script, the English alphabet written to resemble Chinese characters. Then he applies gravity to it and makes a singularity. [The installation] is several stories high and he covered the gallery floor with a mirror. So you walk upstairs and you see it’s like a wormhole, which he turns into an analogy for translation.”

“Anything in the vicinity of a black hole is violently torn apart owing to its extreme gravity—the strongest in the universe,” Gamwell writes about the enduring appeal of black holes as artistic inspiration. “We see this violence in the works of artists like Cai Guo-­Qiang and Takashi Murakami, who have used black holes to symbolize the brutality unleashed by the atomic bomb. The inescapable pull of a black hole is also a ready metaphor for depression in the work of artists such as Moonassi. Thus, on the one hand, the black hole provides artists with a symbol to express the devastations and anxieties of the modern world. On the other hand, however, a black hole’s extreme gravity is the source of stupendous energy, and artists such as Yambe Tam invite viewers to embrace darkness as a path to transformation, awe, and wonder.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This holiday season, German automaker Porsche is winning hearts and minds by putting out a Christmas-themed ad that seemingly isn’t made with AI. What a concept, right?

Called “Porsche Holiday,” the 30-second animated commercial shows a driver elegantly tooling around in his new ride, driving through autumnal scenery on a mountainside road and then a cool sea of glass and concrete as the Sun sets on a city. It’s done up in striking 2D-looking animation with precise lines, pleasing geometry, and eye-popping colors — an ad seemingly done right for a change.

Sharing behind the scenes footage, Porsche revealed in a social media post that the ad was a mix of hand-drawn sketches and CGI. It was made by Parallel Studio, an animation team based in Paris.

Though Porsche made no specific mention of AI, people reading between the lines quickly took that to mean that the automaker was quietly bragging about not using the tech, and hailed it as a victory. This perception of it being AI-free drove it to being remarkably viral, and made it an unexpected hit.

“Can’t wait for more of this anti-AI rebound,” one user wrote.

“Amtrak has been hiring artists to create original animations as well,” observed Nathan Allebach, a creative director. “As slop races us to the bottom, real art signals craft, prestige, and trust.”

The response goes to show how divisive AI is, especially in the arts. And ads, the most commercial art form of all, have both been a useful gauge of how companies have been willing to experiment with the tech and of the public reaction to it, which has been largely pretty negative.

Coca-Cola, for example, unleashed a ghoulishly uncanny iteration of its “Holidays Are Coming” last month that sparked outrage over how overtly ugly it was. McDonalds, too, released an AI-generated ad that proved such a disaster that it sheepishly pulled it entirely.

Everyone knows that our modern idea of the holiday season has been heavily shaped by ad agencies, but no one likes to be reminded of how soulless it can be by seeing AI amalgamations forced onto their eyeballs. At least pretend to care about humans, for Pete’s sake.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some people are hitting a weight loss plateau with GLP-1 agonist drugs like Ozempic, so they’re turning to a stronger variety that promises even more dramatic weight loss — up to more than 70 pounds in some instances, The Atlantic reports.

There’s a small wrinkle: the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to officially approve this medication — technically called retatrutide but cheekily nicknamed a “GLP-3” by users — because it’s still in clinical trials. So the market for it is black, or at least severely grey, with shady overseas companies exploiting a legal loophole to get around regulatory barriers.

In other words, everyone taking retatrutide is basically taking part in an unregulated experiment that could have disastrous results. Sure, you can effortlessly melt off the pounds with the synthetic peptide, but some users have reported disturbing side effects — such as dysesthesia, when your body processes normal sensations but you perceive them as painful, similar to the nerve pain diabetics feel in their feet.

In the grand scheme of things, “GLP-3” users are part of a burgeoning group of people who have turned to foreign-made drugs, many other peptides that are also lacking federal approval. These substances, often manufactured in China, have become wildly popular in recent years for their purported anti-aging and longevity boosting potential, among other miraculous claims.

Companies that sell these drugs are able to skirt federal regulations by writing all over their website that the compounds are not for human consumption and are instead meant for research lab purposes — advice that users are pretty clearly not following.

“All of this stuff just scares the crap out of me,” Randy Seeley, a University of Michigan medical professor and GLP-1 agonist expert, told The Atlantic in reference to the unknown side effects of gray market drugs.

One danger with these drugs, Seeley said, is that their formulations aren’t known and they have the potential to be contaminated with bacteria and other substances. (To allay those concerns, some companies post lab results attesting to the purity of their products.)

Of course, everybody thinks their dealer is an exception.

“There’s a lot of people who just get these things and shoot them,” Marco, a retatrutide user who has bought the drug from what he considers trusted sources, told The Atlantic. “I don’t judge them in any way, but I think those people are out of their minds.”

Injecting GLP-1 agonist drugs into the human body boosts the levels of hormones GLP-1 and GIP, which trigger the release of insulin into your bloodstream. Retatrutide does that and more: it mimics another hormone, glucagon, found in the pancreas. This addition further revs up people’s metabolism, making them lose more weight compared to Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs.

Once clinical trials are done, FDA is expected to approve retatrutide, which will no doubt be a bestseller and make its manufacturer, Eli Lilly, even wealthier.

But even if it’s given the green light, it’s not a guarantee that the demand in the gray market will dissipate, especially if normies find the price too weighty to bear.

            <h2>Alzheimer’s Fully Reversed in Mice, Scientists Say</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A team of American scientists claim they have done something miraculous: they “cured” lab mice suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, which has robbed more than seven million Americans, typically 65 years old and up, of their identity and cognitive ability.

The researchers achieved this feat by administering the rodents with the powerful compound P7C3-A20, which they announced in a new paper in the journal Cell Reports Medicine. Scientists from Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center undertook the study.

“The key takeaway is a message of hope — the effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Andrew A. Pieper, the study’s principal investigator and a CWRU neuroscience professor, in a statement about the research. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”

This research is part of a growing wave of very promising lab studies that point to a tantalizing future where Alzheimer’s and other neurological issues could be a thing of the past. Besides this P7C3-A20 research, others have scored remarkable lab results using different compounds and treatments.

This has made normally cautious scientists so excited that they are making bold predictions. University of Edinburgh neuroscience professor Tara Spires-Jones, who wasn’t part of this P7C3-A20 study, told the BBC this month she thinks scientists are closer than ever to a “truly life-changing” treatment — in as little as five to 10 years; instead of a slow death where people lose themselves, she forecasts that new tests will detect the condition early and innovative treatments will “really make your life normal.”

Scientists are also closer to understanding what causes Alzheimer’s, which seems to be sparked by different factors such as genetics, environment and other stressors — which means that future patients may receive personalized cocktail of anti-Alzheimer’s treatment and drugs suited for their own situation.

Regardless of the cause, previous research has suggested that Alzheimer’s is a form of inflammation. That means lessening or zeroing out inflammation in the brain would be key rather than managing symptoms.

In the P7C3-A20 study, the scientists focused on the impact of the crucial molecule NAD+, a coenzyme important for driving cellular metabolism and which decreases as we age, according to the study. Patients with Alzheimer’s suffer from a significant decrease of NAD+ in the brain, and hence their brain cells have trouble maintaining normal functionality, staving off inflammation, and canceling other physical hallmarks of the disease.

For the study, the team first took two types of lab mice that have been genetically bred to be predisposed to Alzheimer’s; one cohort had mutations for the amyloid protein and the other had tau protein mutations. Both proteins are important to cellular function, but they can become dangerous if they accrete in the brain in the form of amyloid plaques and tau tangles — causing a breakdown in normal cellular processes.

The team injected P7C3-A20 into both mice cohorts at two months of age, later finding out that this treatment successfully prevented them from developing the disease. But the big news was when they injected the compound into another batch of lab mice, who were suffering from a relatively advanced stage of Alzheimer’s at six months of age; after getting injections, these mice completely recovered their cognitive ability and NAD+ levels were restored to homeostasis leve;s

“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Pieper in the statement. “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain’s NAD+ balance is restored.”

What’s also good about this study is that P7C3-A20 offers an alternative pathway to boosting NAD+ levels versus taking over-the-counter chemical precursors for NAD+, which can can raise NAD+ to such toxic levels that people could develop cancer, Pieper said. Supplements to boost NAD+ are just a click away on your cellphone, which should be worrying for anybody concerned about cancer.

The team wants to move to human clinical trials but some people are clearly not waiting; if you search online on how to obtain P7C3-A20 for yourself,  numerous websites selling vials of the compound will pop up.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just days after its robotaxi fleet crumbled into complete disarray because of a city power outage in San Francisco, the company was forced to suspend all rides again in the Bay Area on Thursday in anticipation of a nasty storm, CNBC reported.

Customers received word of the measure via the company’s ride-hailing app.

“Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,” a notification read.

While you can hardly fault Waymo for erring on the side of caution, the measure comes as its self-driving cabs’ ability to handle conditions that fall outside its typical programming is being called into question.

The San Francisco incident, for instance, left its robotaxis stranded and helpless on public roads. Footage showed the cabs piling up at intersections, where they appeared confused about what to do without traffic lights to guide them. Rather than taking initiative or moving themselves out of the way, the cabs stayed idling in the middle of the roads, blocking motorists and even other Waymos. One video showed at least five of the cabs stuck in the same intersection. Frightened animals have a fight-or-flight response; Waymos have a stand-dumbfoundedly-in-place response.

Waymo has been offering fully autonomous rides to the public in San Francisco since 2024, with at least 800 robotaxis in the area. And though it boasts an impressive safety record, the cars have been a controversial presence with locals, whose complaints about the vehicles’ safety reached new heights last month when one of the cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat.

Beyond tragedies like those, the cabs have been spotted more than occasionally driving down the wrong side of the road and committing blunders like getting stuck in a roundabout.

Other incidents like careening through an active police standoff and becoming paralyzed by a parade have exposed that the cars still struggle to handle the diversity of offbeat road scenarios one might be expected to encounter in a bustling city like San Francisco. Waymo can’t be blamed for the power outage last week, but that it seemingly didn’t equip its cars to handle a scenario like that is concerning.

“I think we need to be asking ‘what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?&#39;” former CEO of San Francisco’s Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin told CNBC.

            <div id="article-text">Who needs vicious music columnists when you live in the age of AI?

Apparently not Ashley MacIsaac, a Canadian fiddler, singer, and songwriter who was labeled a sex criminal by Google’s AI overview.

According to the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, event organizers at the Sipekne’katik First Nation, north of Halifax, canceled an upcoming performance featuring MacIsaac after Google incorrectly described him as a sex offender.

The paper reports that the misinformation was the result of one of Google’s AI summaries — brief summations it helpfully plasters above all other search results — which blended the musician’s biography with another person who bears the same name.

“Google screwed up, and it put me in a dangerous situation,” MacIsaac told the paper.

Though the AI overview has since been updated, MacIsaac explained that the situation presents a huge dilemma for him as a touring musician. For one thing, there’s no telling how many other event organizers passed on hiring him because of the libelous claim, or how many potential audience members got the wrong impression, but not the correction.

“People should be aware that they should check their online presence to see if someone else’s name comes in,” MacIsaac told the Globe.

After the truth came to light, the Sipekne’katik First Nation issued an apology, and extended a future welcome to the musician.

“We deeply regret the harm this error caused to your reputation, your livelihood, and your sense of personal safety,” a First Nation spokesperson wrote in a letter shared with the newspaper. “It is important to us to state clearly that this situation was the result of mistaken identity caused by an AI error, not a reflection of who you are.”

A representative for Google, meanwhile, said that “search, including AI Overviews is dynamic and frequently changing to show the most helpful information. When issues arise — like if our features misinterpret web content or miss some context — we use those examples to improve our systems, and may take action under our policies.”

Yet as MacIsaac correctly asserts, reputational risk is a difficult thing to repair. There’s no telling how far that misinformation might have spread — and when a corporation rolls out lazy software with obvious flaws, who’s responsible for the damage?

            <h2>Autopilot Autonomously Lands Plane After Cabin Loses Pressure, for the First Time Ever</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autopilot system took over a plane and pulled off an emergency landing completely autonomously.

The nail-biting intervention took place after the twin engine turboprop, a Beechcraft Super King Air, suddenly lost cabin pressure while flying across Colorado on December 20. Garmin’s Emergency Autoland system then took over, flew the plane, communicated with air traffic controllers, and made a fuss-free landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver.

“This was the first use of Autoland from start-to-finish in an actual emergency,” Garmin said in a statement, via CNN.

Various forms of autoland systems are routinely used to land aircraft in tough weather conditions where visibility is poor — but not during emergencies. Garmin’s system, however, is part of an emerging line of autoland systems intended for emergency use only, and is designed to take “complete control of the flight to land the airplane” in situations “where the pilot is unable to fly,” according to the manufacturer. That it managed to effortlessly handle a real-world emergency here is a milestone in aviation safety.

In this case, Garmin’s Autoland was automatically triggered because the “cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels” after the aircraft experienced “a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization,” Chris Townsley, CEO of the plane’s operator, Buffalo River Aviation, said in a statement. The pilots put on their oxygen masks, then “made the decision to leave the system engaged,” he added.

Once at the reins, the autonomous system selected where to land on its own, based on criteria like distance and runway length, and communicated its intent to ground control. “Emergency autolanding, 19 minutes from runway 30R at KBJC,” the system told the tower, as quoted by The Register.

The plane landed at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport around 2:20 pm local time. No passengers were on board the aircraft. Footage posted by emergency responders shows the two pilots disembark the plane on the runway.

In this case, the pilots made the voluntary decision to let Autoland take over and did not lose consciousness, contrary to initial speculation. (The system’s automated voice erroneously told air control that it had taken over after “pilot incapacitation,” leading to the confusion.)

“While the system performed exactly as expected, the pilots were prepared to resume manual control of the aircraft should the system have malfunctioned in any way,” Townsley said. The pilots “consciously elected to preserve and use all available tools and minimize additional variables in an unpredictable, emergent situation.”

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

            <h2>How to use the new ChatGPT app integrations, including DoorDash, Spotify, Uber, and others</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/how-to-use-the-new-chatgpt-app-integrations-including-doordash-spotify-uber-and-others/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI offers app integrations in ChatGPT to allow you to connect your accounts directly to ChatGPT and ask the assistant to do things for you. For instance, with a Spotify integration, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.

To get started, make sure you’re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.

If you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it’ll take you to the sign-in page for each one.

However, it’s important to note that connecting your account means you’re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you’re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)

You can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.

This integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.

Once you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site. Plus, you can be more specific, like searching for options “with breakfast included.”

When you find a hotel you like, just open the Booking.com listing to complete your reservation.

Canva in ChatGPT is a helpful tool for graphic designers and anyone else who needs to generate visual content quickly. Whether it’s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas.

Once you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like “a 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap” or “a fun poster for a dog-walking business.” You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions.

AI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want.

Coursera’s integration is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level. For instance, you can then tell ChatGPT to find an “intermediate-level course on Python.” You can then tell the chatbot to compare course options by rating, duration, and cost before enrolling. ChatGPT can also provide a quick rundown of what exactly each course covers.

DoorDash’s newly launched ChatGPT integration aims to save time on meal planning and grocery shopping. Users can ask the chatbot for a meal plan and instantly add all ingredients to their DoorDash cart, then review and check out.

​Currently, this feature is available only to users in the U.S., with participating grocery retailers including Kroger, Safeway, Fairway Markets, Wegmans, and more.

ChatGPT can display hotel options and flights via Expedia without leaving chat. Whether you’re looking for a quick escape or a longer trip, it can find flights that fit your travel dates, budget, and number of travelers. You can narrow things down by saying stuff like “Only show 4-star hotels.” Once you see something you like, go to Expedia to finalize everything and book your trip.

To use Figma in ChatGPT, you can ask it to generate diagrams, flow charts, and more. This is helpful for turning your ideas and brainstorming sessions into something more tangible. It may also be useful for visualizing complex concepts or workflows.

You can also upload files and ask the chatbot to generate a product roadmap for your team. This roadmap can include milestones, deliverables, and deadlines, helping your team stay organized and focused on their goals.

One of the most helpful aspects of using Spotify in ChatGPT is the ability to quickly create playlists and listen to new recommended songs tailored to your specific tastes. You can ask it to create a playlist based on your current mood, or just a playlist that only includes tracks by your favorite band.

It can also suggest new artists, playlists, audiobooks, and podcast episodes. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform actions on your behalf, including adding and removing items from your Spotify library.

Retail giant Target strategically launched a beta version of its ChatGPT integration before Black Friday. This feature allows shoppers to ask the chatbot for gift suggestions and quickly create a shopping basket with multiple items without leaving ChatGPT. For example, users can request ideas for a movie night, and the chatbot will provide a curated selection of available Target items. Shoppers can add these items to their cart and make a purchase using their Target account. They can then choose from same-day “Drive Up,” in-store pickup, or standard shipping.

If you’re planning a trip, the Uber integration makes it easy to find ride options, which is especially useful if you’re in a new country. You can set up your trip in the ChatGPT app, then complete the ride request and payment in the Uber app.

Currently, it’s only available in the U.S., and it doesn’t let you book rides in advance; only on-demand rides are available. You can choose from options like UberX, UberXL, Comfort, and Black.

There’s also an Uber Eats integration for U.S. users, so you can check out local restaurants and menu items within ChatGPT, then finish paying in the Uber Eats app.

If you’re looking for a new home, Zillow in ChatGPT could make the search experience more straightforward. Using a simple text prompt, you can find homes that meet your criteria and apply filters to narrow the results. Whether you’re looking for a specific price range, number of bedrooms, or particular neighborhoods, you can specify these details in your prompt, making the search process much more efficient and tailored to your needs.

Alongside the announcement that OpenAI would bring apps into ChatGPT, the company also said it plans to welcome additional partners soon, including OpenTable, PayPal, and Walmart. These will launch in 2026.

The rollout of ChatGPT’s app integrations is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada. Users in Europe and the U.K. are excluded for now.

This story has been updated to include newly launched integrations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT and kicked off a surge in innovation and attention on AI. Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.

But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An MIT survey in August found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.

So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, and increase their budgets for the tech.

Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different?

Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.

Molly Alter, partner, Northzone: A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers.

Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft: We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence.

Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital: 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.

Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect.

Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean: If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.

Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures: We are targeting two distinct frontiers: AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.

Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites.

Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.

Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and datacenters.

Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.

Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: if OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?

Molly Alter, partner, Northzone: It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.

Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures: For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.

Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.

Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.

Scott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners: We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.

Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent.

Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year.

Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over.

Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results, and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.

Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital: Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence.

Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.

Ryan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures: In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.

Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. $1 million to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both.

Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand – a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created.

Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations, and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews.

Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now, it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after 6 months of pilot use.

Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product, and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge North Star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?

Nnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures: Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication.

Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role – for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users.

Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly, and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving.

Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name!

Eric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund: I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots?

Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: these weren’t categories two years ago, but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale.

Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge.

Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media and apps like support or call centers.

Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern: they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to recreate, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done.

Tom Henriksson, general partner at OpenOcean: Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is Operations1, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without.

Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices.

Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. Authzed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems, and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was a normal day when Jay Gibson got an unexpected notification on his iPhone. “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone,” the message read.

Ironically, Gibson used to work at companies that developed exactly the kind of spyware that could trigger such a notification. Still, he was shocked that he received a notification on his own phone. He called his father, turned off and put his phone away, and went to buy a new one.

“I was panicking,” he told TechCrunch. “It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”

Gibson is just one of an ever-increasing number of people who are receiving notifications from companies like Apple, Google, and WhatsApp, all of which send similar warnings about spyware attacks to their users. Tech companies are increasingly proactive in alerting their users when they become targets of government hackers, and in particular those who use spyware made by companies such as Intellexa, NSO Group, and Paragon Solutions.

But while Apple, Google, and WhatsApp alert, they don’t get involved in what happens next. The tech companies direct their users to people who could help, but at which point the companies step away.

This is what happens when you receive one of these warnings.

You have received a notification that you were the target of government hackers. Now what?

First of all, take it seriously. These companies have reams of telemetry data about their users and what happens on both their devices and their online accounts. These tech giants have security teams that have been hunting, studying, and analyzing this type of malicious activity for years. If they think you have been targeted, they are probably right.

It’s important to note that in the case of Apple and WhatsApp notifications, receiving one doesn’t mean you were necessarily hacked. It’s possible that the hacking attempt failed, but they can still tell you that someone tried.

In the case of Google, it’s most likely that the company blocked the attack, and is telling you so you can go into your account and make sure you have multi-factor authentication on (ideally a physical security key or passkey), and also turn on its Advanced Protection Program, which also requires a security key and adds other layers of security to your Google account. In other words, Google will tell you how to better protect yourself in the future.

In the Apple ecosystem, you should turn on Lockdown Mode, which switches on a series of security features that makes it more difficult for hackers to target your Apple devices. Apple has long claimed that it has never seen a successful hack against a user with Lockdown Mode enabled, but no system is perfect.

Mohammed Al-Maskati, the director of Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, a 24/7 global team of security experts who investigate spyware cases against members of civil society, shared with TechCrunch the advice that the helpline gives people who are concerned that they may be targeted with government spyware.

This advice includes keeping your devices’ operating systems and apps up-to-date; switching on Apple’s Lockdown Mode, and Google’s Advanced Protection for accounts and for Android devices; be careful with suspicious links and attachments; to restart your phone regularly; and to pay attention to changes in how your device functions.

			Have you received a notification from Apple, Google, or WhatsApp about being targeted with spyware? Or do you have information about spyware makers? We would love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.

What happens next depends on who you are.

There are open source and downloadable tools that anyone can use to detect suspected spyware attacks on their devices, which requires a little technical knowledge. You can use the Mobile Verification Toolkit, or MVT, a tool that lets you look for forensic traces of an attack on your own, perhaps as a first step before looking for assistance.

If you don’t want or can’t use MVT, you can go straight to someone who can help. If you are a journalist, dissident, academic, or human rights activist, there are a handful of organizations that can help.

You can turn to Access Now and its Digital Security Helpline. You can also contact Amnesty International, which has its own team of investigators and ample experience in these cases. Or, you can reach out to The Citizen Lab, a digital rights group at the University of Toronto, which has been investigating spyware abuses for almost 15 years.

If you are a journalist, Reporters Without Borders also has a digital security lab that offers to investigate suspected cases of hacking and surveillance.

Outside of these categories of people, politicians or business executives, for example, will have to go elsewhere.

If you work for a large company or political party, you likely have a competent (hopefully!) security team you can go straight to. They may not have the specific knowledge to investigate in-depth, but in that case they probably know who to turn to, even if Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab cannot help those outside of civil society.

Otherwise, there aren’t many places executives or politicians you can turn to, but we have asked around and found the ones below. We can’t fully vouch for any of these organizations, nor do we endorse them directly, but based on suggestions from people we trust, it’s worth pointing them out.

Perhaps the most well known of these private security companies is iVerify, which makes an app for Android and iOS, and also gives users an option to ask for an in-depth forensic investigation.

Matt Mitchell, a well-regarded security expert who’s been helping vulnerable populations protect themselves from surveillance has a new startup, called Safety Sync Group, which offers this kind of service.

Jessica Hyde, a forensic investigator with experience in the public and private sectors, has her own startup called Hexordia, and offers to investigate suspected hacks.

Mobile cybersecurity company Lookout, which has experience analyzing government spyware from around the world, has an online form that allows people to reach out for help to investigate cyberattacks involving malware, device compromise, and more. The company’s threat intelligence and forensics teams may then get involved.

Then, there’s Costin Raiu, who heads TLPBLACK, a small team of security researchers who used to work at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Group, or GReAT. Raiu was the unit’s head when his team discovered sophisticated cyberattacks from elite government hacking teams from the United States, Russia, Iran, and other countries. Raiu told TechCrunch that people who suspect they’ve been hacked can email him directly.

What happens next depends on who you go to for help.

Generally speaking, the organization you reach out to may want to do an initial forensic check by looking at a diagnostic report file that you can create on your device, which you can share with the investigators remotely. At this point, this doesn’t require you to hand over your device to anyone.

This first step may be able to detect signs of targeting or even infection. It may also turn out nothing. In both cases, the investigators may want to dig deeper, which will require you to send in a full backup of your device, or even your actual device. At that point, the investigators will do their work, which may take time because modern government spyware attempts to hide and delete its tracks, and will tell you what happened.

Unfortunately, modern spyware may not leave any traces. The modus operandi these days, according to Hassan Selmi, who leads the incident response team at Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, is a “smash and grab” strategy, meaning that once spyware infects the target device, it steals as much data as it can, and then tries to remove any trace and uninstall itself. This is assumed as the spyware makers trying to protect their product and hide its activity from investigators and researchers.

If you are a journalist, a dissident, an academic, a human rights activist, the groups who help you may ask if you want to publicize the fact that you were attacked, but you’re not required to do so. They will be happy to help you without taking public credit for it. There may be good reasons to come out, though: To denounce the fact that a government targeted you, which may have the side effect of warning others like you of the dangers of spyware; or to expose a spyware company by showing that their customers are abusing their technology.

We hope you never get one of these notifications. But we also hope that, if you do, you find this guide useful. Stay safe out there.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/from-sonos-to-sauron-new-ceo-takes-on-high-end-home-security-startup-still-in-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Kevin Hartz’s security system failed to alert him as an intruder rang his doorbell and tried to enter his San Francisco home late one night, the serial entrepreneur decided existing solutions weren’t good enough. His co-founder Jack Abraham had experienced similar frustrations at his Miami Beach residence.

In 2024, they launched Sauron — named after the sinister, all-seeing eye from “The Lord of the Rings” — to build what they envisioned as a military-grade home security system for tech elites. The concept resonated in Bay Area circles, where crime had become a constant topic during and after the pandemic, despite San Francisco Police Department statistics showing property crime and homicide rates declining last year.

The startup raised $18 million from executives behind Flock Safety and Palantir, defense tech investors including 8VC, Abraham’s startup lab Atomic, and Hartz’s investment firm A*. It came out of stealth exactly a year ago, promising to launch in the first quarter of 2025 with a system combining AI-driven intelligence, advanced sensors like LiDAR and thermal imaging, and 24/7 human monitoring by former military and law enforcement personnel.

But a year later, Sauron is still very much in development mode —  a reality that its new CEO, Maxime “Max” Bouvat-Merlin, acknowledged candidly in a recent interview with TechCrunch.

After nearly nine years at Sonos, including a stint as chief product officer, Bouvat-Merlin took the helm of Sauron just last month. He’s spending his first days on the job finalizing fundamental questions: which sensors to use, how exactly the deterrence system will work, and when the company can realistically get products into customers’ homes.

The answer to that last question? Later in 2026 at the earliest — a significant delay from the original timeline.

“We’re in the development phase,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “You’ll see a phased approach where we get our solution to market as a stepping stone. All the different components — our concierge service, our AI software running on servers, our smart cameras — are building blocks coming together in a plan we just put in place very recently.”

Still, Bouvat-Merlin sees striking parallels between Sauron and Sonos, which both target wealthy customers first, rely on word-of-mouth growth, and combine complex hardware with sophisticated software. “I had lunch with John MacFarlane, the founder of Sonos, a few weeks ago,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “All the topics he was thinking about when starting Sonos were exactly the same topics we’re discussing at Sauron.”

Both companies faced the same strategic questions: Start with super-premium customers or mass premium? Professional installation or DIY? Build everything in-house or partner with an ecosystem? “We might make different decisions, but the questions are very similar,” he said.

Bouvat-Merlin says he was drawn to Sauron by both the mission and an opportunity to solve a real customer problem. “Securing people’s homes is important, but I also like the deterrence aspect — changing people’s minds before they make a bad decision and get into trouble,” he said.

His research showed that market leaders in premium home security have small market shares and negative Net Promoter Scores. “People are not happy with their solutions today,” he said. “There are so many false positives that when law enforcement is called, they don’t respond because they assume it’s a false alarm.”

The company is targeting customers “where safety and security is a major concern”  —  people like Hartz. The plan is to start with this premium segment, establish a reputation for supporting demanding clients, then expand to what Bouvat-Merlin calls “mass premium.”

So what exactly is Sauron building? The answer is still evolving. The offering starts with camera pods containing multiple sensors —  “40 cameras and different types of sensors, potentially LiDAR and radar, potentially thermal,” Bouvat-Merlin said. These pods connect to servers running machine learning software for computer vision, all linked to a 24/7 concierge service staffed by former military and law enforcement personnel.

“Those people understand patterns,” he said. “They’re good at helping us mature our machine learning solution and train our system to detect weird behaviors.”

The deterrence system remains somewhat vague. Options being considered include loudspeakers, flashing lights, and other methods. But Bouvat-Merlin emphasized that deterrence should begin before someone enters a property, detecting when homes are being surveilled, noticing cars circling neighborhoods multiple times, and identifying threats at each stage.

“The more upfront we are with deterrence, the more we can convince people this is the wrong house to rob and the wrong decision to make,” he said.

As for the drones mentioned when Sauron first took the wraps off its plans last year, Bouvat-Merlin declined to say much. “These are roadmap conversations. I don’t want to go too deep at this point because there are so many things we could do, but we’re such a small company,” he said. He added that, bigger picture, the focus is on growing the ecosystem through partnerships rather than reinventing the wheel.

With fewer than 40 employees, Sauron plans to hire just 10 to 12 more in 2026. The company will also begin working with early adopters later in 2026, with a Series A fundraise planned for mid-year.

“Raising a Series A is not about raising because we have to — it’s because we want to,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “I want to make sure we’re showing progress and explaining how we’ll use extra funds to accelerate growth, [including to] launch our first end-to-end product, drive customer adoption, and accelerate the roadmap.”

The company has already attracted a significant list of prospective clients, he said, thanks to work by Sauron’s three founders, which include roboticist and engineer Vasumathi Raman. “We expect the strategy initially to be word of mouth, then grow differently over time.”

But Bouvat-Merlin is cautious about growth. “I want to make sure we grow sustainably and keep the experience and service premium over time,” he said. “I want to manage growing pains as much as possible while driving profitability.”

The surveillance state questionFacial recognition and privacy concerns loom large for a surveillance-heavy product. Bouvat-Merlin outlined one approach: a trust-based system where homeowners grant access to specific people. “I granted you access to my house, so now you’re in the trusted group. When you come, I detect it’s you and you’re allowed in. Everyone else is an unknown person,” he said, painting a picture of a likely scenario.

License plate detection is also being considered for identifying cars circling neighborhoods multiple times. “How do we assess if that’s a threat? The ex-military and ex-law enforcement team will be really good at helping mature our machine learning solution,” he said.

Either way, Bouvat-Merlin is confident in the opportunity ahead because of Sauron’s approach. “A lot of companies started as traditional security companies and are trying to add tech,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’re looking at it from the opposite angle — we’re a tech startup in San Francisco bringing technology to this market.”

Sauron is also appearing on the scene as concerns rise about crime among the most wealthy. Recent high-profile incidents include a November armed robbery at the home of tech investors Lachy Groom and Joshua Buckley in San Francisco’s Mission District, where $11 million in cryptocurrency was stolen during a 90-minute ordeal involving torture and threats.

“We see people who are wealthy attracting criminals,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “We’ve seen a lot of robberies in San Francisco and other major U.S. cities, sometimes at gunpoint. I don’t think the world is getting safer — there are probably more disparities between people at the top and bottom of the wealth spectrum. We see anxiety from prospective clients who are eager to get their homes secured.”Still, much remains uncertain about Sauron’s path. The company must finalize everything from sensor configurations to manufacturing locations. (Bouvat-Merlin mentioned potentially starting in the U.S. for proximity and control, then moving to more affordable locations as volume grows.)

It must also determine how to serve customers in different settings,  from estates with perimeters to dense urban residences, while maintaining premium service quality.

For now, Bouvat-Merlin says he’s focused on listening to his team, building credibility, and finalizing the strategy he’s putting in place. “I don’t demand that people trust me  — I want to show them why they should.”

The company expects to share more details about its products later next year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Untold numbers of ICE agents have appeared on America’s streets in recent months, and many of them have committed acts of aggression with seeming impunity. ICE agents have detained suspected illegal immigrants without cause—including U.S. citizens and lawful residents. They have, in effect, kidnapped people, breaking into cars to make arrests. They have used tear gas and pepper spray on nonviolent protesters. They have refused to identify themselves, wearing masks, using unmarked cars, and switching license plates, presumably to avoid detection. They have kept people in detention without access to lawyers. They have questioned people simply for appearing Latino, speaking Spanish, and being in areas believed to be frequented by illegal immigrants.

Many of these tactics are plainly illegal. The Constitution incontestably applies to federal immigration officers: The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and excessive force and requires a warrant to search a private home. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process and bans self-incrimination. The Sixth Amendment establishes a person’s right to counsel. Why, then, are they getting away with not following the Constitution?

Their impunity traces back to two Supreme Court decisions that put far too much faith in ICE’s commitment to respecting people’s constitutional rights. As a result of these cases, people whose rights are violated by ICE agents have little to no recourse. Contrast that with the rules for police officers. If a police officer kicks down your door and searches your home without a warrant, questions you without a Miranda warning, or illegally arrests you, a provision known as the exclusionary rule may prevent the evidence gathered through those tactics from being admitted in your prosecution. And if you happen to be acquitted, you can sue for damages. None of that is true when it comes to ICE.

The first of these two cases is a 1984 decision, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, that untethered ICE from the exclusionary rule. In a 5–4 opinion, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor rejected the exclusionary rule for immigration courts, favoring, instead, “a deliberately simple deportation hearing system.” In a typical criminal case, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct—the idea being that the police will avoid such conduct if it risks undermining a conviction. But for ICE, the Court decided, such deterrence is not necessary. Unless ICE conduct amounts to an “egregious” violation of the Fourth Amendment, the evidence that agents gather even through illegal means can be used in immigration courts. Key to the Court’s decision was a presumption that Fourth Amendment violations by ICE officers were not “widespread” and that the Immigration and Naturalization Service “has already taken sensible and reasonable steps to deter Fourth Amendment violations by its officers.” Such assumptions may not have been reasonable then; they are certainly not reasonable now.

A second Court decision appears to have eliminated, or at least seriously limited, the possibility of lawsuits for damages after individuals are unlawfully detained, searched, or experience excessive force at the hands of ICE. When the police engage in misconduct, the victim can sue the responsible officers for damages. Again, not so for ICE. In the 2022 decision Egbert v. Boule, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, denied the rights of plaintiffs to sue Border Patrol agents for excessive use of force in the name of “national security.” There is every reason to believe that the Supreme Court would extend the rationale in Boule to shield ICE from liability as well. The Court would effectively be greenlighting ICE’s abusive tactics and insulating agents from damages when they are, in fact, no different from any state or city police officer who violates a person’s constitutional rights. As in INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, the rationale in Boule relies on the agency’s purported ability to self-regulate; after all, Thomas suggested, Border Patrol “must investigate ‘alleged violations’ and accept grievances.” Can anyone count on such care to come from Border Patrol under this administration? Again, the faith in these institutions to self-regulate seems tragically misplaced.

The remaining options for someone mistreated by ICE are inadequate, to say the least. An individual could file a lawsuit under the Federal Torts Claims Act against federal officers, but that law has its shortcomings: A person must submit a detailed claim to the government and wait for a response before they can go to court. That process can take years and years. An individual could also file a complaint with the DHS Office of Inspector General or the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which would theoretically launch an investigation, but in this administration, the chances of redress for misconduct are slim to none. Nothing drives the point home more than the case of a CBP commander, Gregory Bovino. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found that he had lied to the court about whether he had used excessive force against protesters in Chicago. Was he dismissed or disciplined? Neither; he went on to lead another immigration sweep, this time in New Orleans.

Then there are the practical problems with contesting ICE misconduct. Where in the United States is the immigrant? In which detention facility? Do they have a lawyer? Worse, what if they have already been deported through a process known as expedited removal? Expedited removal generally involves a determination by a low-level immigration officer who, in many cases during a single interview, determines that the noncitizen arrived in the U.S. without proper documents and therefore cannot prove that he or she has been physically present in the U.S. for two years. (Exceptions are made only for people who have a credible fear of persecution or torture, or who intend to apply for asylum—exceptions that have been severely limited under this administration.) Although expedited removal used to apply only to noncitizens within 100 miles of the border, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has expanded the policy to apply to any unlawful noncitizen anywhere in the country who cannot prove two years of residency, giving them no time to secure counsel or gather evidence, no right to appeal, and surely no meaningful due process.

Even for those who manage to get before an immigration judge, the process is formidable. ICE attorneys have been systematically asking immigration judges to dismiss proceedings in order to strip individuals of even the limited protections those hearings afford. Judge Jia Cobb, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., noted in a recent decision that people have been arrested immediately following dismissals, subjected to expedited removal, and shortly removed. These tactics, combined with the administration’s expanded policy of mandatory detention—meaning the immigrant is not entitled to bail—have turned immigration courts into what the former chief counsel for Joe Biden’s Citizenship and Immigration Services characterized as a “deportation pipeline.”

Much of what ICE is doing is not remotely constitutional. The Court decisions that laid the groundwork for the agency’s lawlessness no longer stand up to basic scrutiny. As Justice O’Connor said in INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, “our conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule’s value might change, if there developed good reason to believe that Fourth Amendment violations by INS officers were widespread.” There’s more than good reason; there’s every reason.</div>

            <h2>How Mary Todd Lincoln Lands Totally Out of Context</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/oh-mary-theater-trump/685446/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By now, you will be used to the feminist practice of finding a historical woman and rescuing her from the clutches of evil biographers who have done her dirty. What if Marie Antoinette or Typhoid Mary were a more rounded figure—more constrained by the expectations of her time, perhaps, or a victim of her circumstances and upbringing?

That is not the approach that the playwright Cole Escola has taken in Oh, Mary!, which is currently playing on Broadway and has just opened in London. Escola’s question about Mary Todd Lincoln, wife and widow of America’s 16th president, is this: What if she were an absolute monster? The idea for the show came from an email Escola sent to themselves in 2009, which read: “Write a play (maybe musical?) about Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln in which it comes out being a good thing that Abe Lincoln dies.”

To fulfill that brief, the 39-year-old playwright has taken the Mary of the historical record—a laudanum user, prone to wild mood swings and shopping sprees, eventually confined to an asylum by her own son—and made her worse. This Mary drinks paint thinner and pushes her companion, Louisa, down the stairs. Above all, she desperately wants to be a cabaret star, and believes that Abraham has thwarted her dream. Fatally, he reacts to her constant complaints by hiring a handsome actor—whose identity becomes important later in the plot—to give her lessons for the “legitimate theater.”

Having already seen the show on Broadway, I was curious to know how such a quintessentially American story would land in Britain. (No one here could pick Mary Todd Lincoln out of a first-lady lineup, even though this is the second play about her to open in London in 2025.) How does a show whose satirical power comes from cutting against received wisdom deal with the audience having no idea what that received wisdom is? The answer is: Training wheels and a reliance on physical comedy help, up to a point.

In London, the play begins with a straightforward exposition dump: A preshow voiceover establishes Mary Todd Lincoln as the wife of President Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated by the actor John Wilkes Booth. Oh, Mary!, shorn of its political resonance, falls squarely into an established populist British stage tradition: pantomime, in which unwitting 7-year-olds are corralled into a theater at Christmastime to watch well-worn favorites such as Aladdin or Dick Whittington and His Cat, a folktale in which a young man (always played by a woman) leaves home to make his fortune in London. Pantomime leans heavily on popular songs, risqué jokes, and melodrama, just like Oh, Mary!

In addition to writing the play, Escola originated the lead role, playing Mary as a 19th-century Veruca Salt, all wobbling curls and petulantly folded arms. “Mary is just me,” Escola once told NPR. “It’s all based on me and my feelings, and all of my characters are some aspect of me that I’m ashamed of or curious about.” Since then, the Marys have tended to be either queer actors or gay icons, underlining the show’s immersion in gay culture. (Mary repeatedly addresses a portrait of George Washington as “Mother,” and this Abraham Lincoln is gay, too.) The London Mary is played by the nonbinary actor Mason Alexander Park, best known for portraying Ariel in Jamie Lloyd’s truly cursed production of The Tempest.

I saw the play on Broadway with the drag queen Jinkx Monsoon, who followed Escola and others, and was herself followed by Jane Krakowski. The role does not call for subtlety. “I have to imagine that somewhere along the line someone had to have told you, ‘You’re a little too big,’” Monsoon told Krakowski in September. “I’ve been told that a billion times.”

When I saw Monsoon’s (yes, very big) performance, I did think, snobbily: Oh, look, the Americans have discovered panto. I wasn’t alone. The London reviews have been positive, but the two harshest ones described the show as “sophomoric” and “farce at its broadest” (The Guardian) and “a bit … ’70s? A little bit Airplane!, a little bit Benny Hill, maybe even a touch of Mr Bean” (Time Out). In the British context, these reviewers implied, Oh, Mary!’s humor reads as dated rather than groundbreaking. That’s largely because of the pantomime tradition. I was brought up on this genre, which also usually features a dame (always played by a man: In a production of Aladdin, Ian McKellen once gave a fantastic Widow Twankey) and volleys of double entendres for parents. The title character in Dick Whittington has a cat mostly so all the other characters can remark on his “lovely pussy.”

This is the energy that Escola has brought to Oh, Mary! Todd Lincoln, under her prim crinoline, is wearing red-and-white-striped bloomers, which is very panto. And just like a panto, the staging is deliberately lo-fi: two static sets, a wheeled-on theater box, and a bit of front-of-curtain business. On Broadway, The New York Times described it as having “the cheesy naturalism of community theater.”

What Escola has built on this foundation, however, is truly unhinged. Do you remember the end of Inglourious Basterds, when Quentin Tarantino kills off the entire Nazi Party in an exploding movie theater? Yeah, about that unhinged. Mary might be awful, but Escola makes her pathetic too, with her terrible loneliness and her deluded belief that she could have been a star. “I don’t even want to be alive,” she tells her acting teacher at the start of their first lesson. More than anything else, she is bored—a default condition for humanity before smartphones and reliable Wi-Fi. History isn’t just battles and bowers; it’s privileged people in gilded rooms waiting for death or the invention of streaming services, whichever comes first. For aristocratic women, this boredom was particularly acute, because their enforced inactivity was a status symbol. The Mitford sisters, growing up in rural Oxfordshire in the 1920s, found their lives so tedious that they invented, as one of them put it, “a contest to see who could best stand being pinched really hard.” This sounds exactly like something Escola’s Mary would inflict on her companion, Louisa.

Earlier this year, Oh, Mary! was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, an award that  in 2016 went to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton. As it happens, I rewatched Hamilton not long ago, and its earnest paeans to diversity (“Immigrants, we get the job done”) now feel like the last gasp of the Obama era.

When Hamilton first came to Britain, I wrote that its blend of rap, classical music, and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas showed that it “speaks all the cultural languages of America, and it echoes Obama’s ability to change cadences depending on his audience.” Added to that, by offering cheap tickets in a daily street lottery alongside the usual sky-high prices of Broadway, “Miranda created a fan base that mirrors the ‘Obama coalition’ of Democrat voters: college-educated coastal liberals and mid-to-low-income minorities.” Hamilton might have been great entertainment, but it also took seriously the idea of educating America about its history, in a spirit now continued by the popular Substack historian Heather Cox Richardson.

Read: Watching Hamilton is like opening a time capsule

Like Hamilton, Oh, Mary! uses color-conscious casting, reframing white historical figures by having nonwhite actors play them. And like Hamilton, it is an improbable box-office smash: It became the first production to gross more than $1 million a week at the Lyceum Theater in New York. But otherwise, the two plays could not be more different. Instead of Obama-era earnestness, Oh, Mary! is steeped in the signature moods of the Trump era: pure camp, twisted humor, and lol nothing matters nihilism. (Think: Donald Trump dancing to “YMCA,” or the casual cruelty of all those deportation videos.) Escola did “less than no research” into Mary Todd Lincoln, to avoid the temptation of writing in-jokes. “I wanted to have the same knowledge that the audience had,” Escola told Seth Meyers. “I didn’t want to do research and then be making jokes about, like, ‘Well, that’ll get a laugh ’cause that’s where she was born.’” This artistic decision worked out well for me, a person who had no idea where Mary Todd Lincoln was born until I looked it up for this article.

The audience also learns precisely nothing about Mary’s divided loyalties—she was born in Kentucky, and several of her half-brothers fought for the Confederacy. Her real-life grief over the death of her sons Eddie and Willie is completely absent; Mary assures her acting teacher that “I never go near the children.” Even the Civil War barely gets a look-in. When Abraham complains about fighting with the South, Mary growls, “The South of what?!” His announcement of the end of the war is included only to set up a contrast with Mary’s activities that afternoon—discovering that Louisa “wants to rub ice cream on her pussy!”

In its absolute refusal to take history seriously, Oh, Mary! is basically the anti-Hamilton. But then, we are living through the mirror image of the Obama era right now. Escola’s Mary is a monster, but also a ham, a narcissist, and a born entertainer—and the audience ends up glued to her every move. I mean, you could suggest a parallel with contemporary America there. Or you could just enjoy the wigs and the gags and the spotted bloomers.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you went to the movies this fall, you probably met him: the Sad Art Dad. You’ll have known him by his miserableness; despite the flash of the cameras and the cheers of the groundlings, he’s most often found moping alone. His vocation may vary—movie star (in Jay Kelly), art-house director (Sentimental Value), blockbuster Tudor playwright (Hamnet)—but his problem tends to be the same. He has chosen great art over good parenting, utterly failing as a father, and he knows it. There’s something delicious about his cocktail of self-pity and self-loathing, which can arouse both the viewer’s repulsion and compassion. It may not be much fun to be a Sad Art Dad, but it’s certainly fun to watch one.

The distant and distracted patriarch, although abundant on-screen in 2025, is not a novel invention. Yet most movie dads are more likely to be found balancing stellar careers and model parenting (lawyer-dad in To Kill A Mockingbird; Mob-dad in the Godfather films) than exhibiting—let alone acknowledging—their fatherly flaws. Sometimes prioritizing professional ambitions is even depicted as admirable: In Interstellar, Matthew McConaughey plays an astronaut who abandons his kids for a decades-long space mission, but only in order to save humanity. The character might beat himself up for it, but the viewer understands that it’s a pretty good excuse, as far as they go.

What’s different about this new cinematic crop of dads is their culpability. They each choose themselves over their kids, prioritizing creative fulfillment. George Clooney’s titular A-lister in Noah Baumbach’s Jay Kelly admits as much when trying to explain his years-long absence to his now-adult daughter: “I wanted something very badly,” he says, “and I thought if I took my eye off of it, I couldn’t have it.” At least Jay is trying to apologize. When Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård), the ornery patriarch of Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value, is accused by his daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve) of never having watched her perform, he defends himself by saying that he doesn’t like theater. Meanwhile, in Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) likes the theater a bit too much. Although he’s a much more affectionate parent than Jay or Gustav, the Bard’s absence—he gallops away from plaguey Stratford-upon-Avon to the Elizabethan West End—has calamitous consequences for his kids.

Read: Parenting is the least of her worries

But these films are not pat condemnations of the flawed fathers they depict; they illustrate, sometimes with seeming ambivalence, the consequences of such self-absorption. Tellingly, Sentimental Value’s most tender scene doesn’t feature Gustav at all. Instead, it’s a quiet moment between Nora and her sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Having finally read Gustav’s latest screenplay, and found within it surprising echoes of the darkest periods of her own life, an emotional Nora sits on her bedroom floor beside her sister. The script is so uncannily accurate, Agnes notes, that it’s as though their father had been there for Nora’s suffering. “Well, he wasn’t,” Nora replies. “You were.”

It’s a gorgeous demonstration of familial love that also lays bare the true cost of the Sad Art Dad’s narcissism. He has made himself redundant; his children have learned, painfully, to cope without him. The same specter of redundancy haunts both Hamnet and Jay Kelly. When Shakespeare arrives home after tragedy strikes, he finds that he’s too late to help his family. He then announces his intent to return to London—and his wife, Agnes (Jessie Buckley), slaps him. Jay’s daughter Jess (Riley Keough) tells her father with brutal candor not to worry about her: “I’m gonna have a good life, just not with you.” A memorable shot in Sentimental Value shows Gustav standing alone on a Normandy beach, his hulking, black-suited figure marooned against miles of sand and scudding lilac clouds. The price of failed fatherhood, it seems, is loneliness.

Does the Sad Art Dad regret his choices? Is making great art—which, in these films, has a capacious, allegorical quality—worth ruining your relationship with your kids? Each of these movies tries to convince us, with varying degrees of success, that prioritizing your artistic endeavors offers emotional compensation. Hamnet, for instance, ends with a delicately choreographed moment of parental connection. Agnes, standing in the audience at the Globe Theatre, reaches out to grasp the hand of the young actor playing Hamlet; in the film’s version of the play, the tragic boy-hero is named for her dead son. Moving though it is, the scene’s mawkishness renders it unpersuasive: Agnes’s abrupt pivot from bitterly resenting her husband to forgiving him strains credulity. A play, even a Shakespeare play, is no substitute for a child.

Read: Two different ways of understanding fatherhood

Jay Kelly also considers the case for putting your craft before your kids, but only half-heartedly. It toys with the idea that the magic of the movies at least partially justifies Jay’s parental negligence; the film ends on a long close-up of Jay’s face as he watches a retrospective reel of his career, visibly moved. But the film ultimately gives up trying to convince the audience that the art was worth the human cost. In its closing line, Jay asks, fruitlessly, for a chance to live his life over again. Measured against the wreckage of his relationships, Hollywood’s comforts prove chilly even to the movie star.

Sentimental Value’s vision of film as a doorway to empathy and repair is by far the most compelling. Gustav’s script may dwindle beside the compassion his daughters offer each other, yet his transformation of Nora’s pain into art is still an act of love. As Agnes says to her sister: “I think he wrote it for you.” Gustav’s work, we realize, is more empathetic, more attentive to other people, than he is. His daughters might find this to be a bitter-tasting irony, but the consolation is real—particularly for an actor like Nora, who eventually finds creative catharsis playing the part Gustav based on her.

Oddly, despite his inadequacies, the Sad Art Dad suggests a promising cultural shift on-screen. To pay attention to the idea of flawed fatherhood, after all, is to think seriously about what constitutes its opposite, the good dad. Laura Dern’s unsentimental divorce lawyer says it well in Baumbach’s Marriage Story, which is also about depressed dads: “The idea of a good father was only invented, like, 30 years ago.” As such, it’s striking to find three films out at the same time that are gnawed by such similar anxieties. Perhaps Joachim Trier put it best: “Tenderness is the new punk.”</div>

            <h2>The Slow, Inevitable Death of the Bowl Game</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/death-college-football-bowl-playoff/685454/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been a hard month for the once-prestigious college bowl. Just hours after Notre Dame learned that it would not be included in this season’s College Football Playoff—the mega-popular, multibillion-dollar, 12-team invitational that crowns an NCAA Division I champion—the team announced that it would not play in any bowl whatsoever this year. Nine other programs, including Florida State, Auburn, and Baylor, soon followed Notre Dame’s lead, declining bowl bids. Fans, pundits, and football insiders lashed out at these schools for refusing to finish out the season with one final game. Notre Dame took the brunt of the criticism; people called the team “quitters” and wondered if its choice sounded “a death knell” for the entire bowl tradition.

Here’s the reality: The bowls have been dying a slow death in terms of cultural importance since 1998, when the college-football power brokers instituted the first national-championship game open to teams from every major conference. The move to a four-team playoff in 2014 hastened the decline of the old bowl system, and last year’s expansion to a 12-team playoff put it on life support. With the best teams now competing in a proper playoff, the other postseason games have effectively become consolation prizes, late-season scrimmages with no stakes whatsoever.

It should have been obvious that this format would render the pageantry of the bowls irrelevant. The power brokers who created the national-title game back in 1998 worried as much: “In an effort to focus on a championship game,” the Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said way back at the start, “we’re putting all the other bowls in a negative position.”

At the time, the bowls truly mattered. In the 1989–90 season, teams played just 18 bowl games. For many players, a bowl game was one of their only chances to appear on national television, and the exposure launched careers. The Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl dated back to the early 20th century and managed to transcend sports, becoming must-watch TV on New Year’s Day—the Rose Bowl perhaps most of all. Jim Delany, a former commissioner of the Big Ten, told me recently that the teams in his conference didn’t dream about winning national titles; they dreamed about going to Pasadena, California, to play in the Rose Bowl. “It was welcomed as a cultural event,” Delany said. “It had a great time slot on New Year’s Day—at 2 p.m. local, 5 p.m. eastern. The parade and the ratings were Super Bowl–esque in the ’50s and ’60s.”

Sally Jenkins: How to fix the mess of college sports

Even the lesser bowls—such as the Holiday Bowl, played for the first time in 1978 in San Diego—mattered. Ty Detmer, the quarterback at Brigham Young University from 1988 to 1991, threw for 576 yards against Penn State in the 1989 Holiday Bowl, which was broadcast on ESPN. The following season, Detmer won the Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious award in college football. In a lot of ways, Detmer told me, he could trace his Heisman win to his performance in that game against Penn State. “That put us on the map,” he said. “That was the culmination of our season, even though it wasn’t a national championship.”

But the tradition of the bowls was also slowing the growth of the game. In many seasons, the best teams in the country never crossed paths. They played in different conferences during the regular season and didn’t match up in the bowls. That left it up to pollsters to determine a national champion by a vote. Many years, they returned different results, leading to two champions; in the 1990s, fans were horrified when three seasons ended without a clear winner.

Fans demanded a new system—and one man had a solution. Roy Kramer, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, believed that he could preserve the sanctity of the bowls while giving people the national champion they wanted. Kramer pulled together a coalition of fellow commissioners, including Delany at the Big Ten. Together, they laid the groundwork for the Bowl Championship Series, a format that would include every major conference and create the first-ever national-title game that would name an indisputable college-football champion. Huddling in a small library at the SEC headquarters with a young public-relations man named Charles Bloom, Kramer set out to invent a mathematical formula that used data points, including a team’s overall record and the strength of its schedule, to determine which two teams should get the call to play in the title game.

Bloom, who is now an athletic director at the University of South Carolina, told me that Kramer was driven to get the formula right, demanding “relentless research.” When they thought they had one that worked, Kramer and Bloom checked it against the results of previous seasons to make sure that it successfully chose the best two teams. And when the system was unveiled, in 1998, Kramer had created a new—and more certain—world. Finally, the college-football season would end with a clear champion.

Almost immediately, the criticism came. “Today, people are arguing about the 12th and 13th teams,” Bloom said. “Well, back then you were arguing about the second and third teams.” Every year, teams felt snubbed. The arguments, at times, grew heated, and people began calling for a bigger playoff.

Kramer pushed back. He said that he could list “100 reasons” an expanded playoff would be bad for the sport—one being that it would make the bowls irrelevant. But by the early 2000s, Kramer was in his early 70s and nearing retirement. From the moment he left the SEC, in 2002, younger voices began rallying support for playoff expansion. After years of debate, a four-team playoff began in 2014.

Jemele Hill: The most egregious double standard in sports

But with more spots in the playoff field, more teams could now make a credible case that they should have been included. Arguments became a staple of bowl season. Delany, who was still the commissioner of the Big Ten at the time, knew what was coming next: an even bigger playoff. “It was obvious that it was going to grow, and going to grow, and going to grow,” he said, “because no matter what you give, people want more.”

In general, most people would agree that the 12-team playoff, launched last year, has been good for college football. Teams competing this season will split nearly $120 million in winnings. ESPN inked a $7.8 billion deal to broadcast these games through the 2031–32 season, and if last year’s ratings are any indication, fans will be tuning in to watch: The title game in January drew a TV audience of more than 22 million viewers.

Before the second season with the new playoff format is even over, Kramer’s predictions are already coming true. The bowls do mean less, because the playoff is now everything. This postseason involves 11 playoff games, with high stakes and big crowds—as well as 35 other bowl games, played for the most part by mediocre teams with mediocre records, with very little fanfare at all. These games aren’t the Rose Bowl of yesteryear. They aren’t even the Holiday Bowl circa 1989. They’re the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl, the GameAbove Sports Bowl, the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl. And in the years to come, you can bet that more college programs will skip them. They won’t want bowls; they’ll want the playoffs, which the college-football power brokers are already considering expanding—to 16 teams, or maybe 24.

It’s the future that Roy Kramer feared. At least he won’t be around to see it. He died at the age of 96 early this month, just a few days before Notre Dame got snubbed, took its football, and went home.

Impressive response times -- but is that just for the panel alone?  Is it only when in the non-upscaling mode perhaps?

There has to be some degree of overhead (aka latency) involved in AI upscaling so I would be very cautious that they&#39;re carefully referring to many key performance metrics when in regular monitor mode and seemingly not clearly stating the effects (if any) of introducing the upscaling.

Of course it&#39;s &quot;AI&quot; so it must be good... right?  Sigh!

games already do this, with algorithms that are more advanced than what a monitor can do.

i don&#39;t really see a reason for a monitor to do this.

How to make your main marketing point the main reason that no one wants your product.

But instead of standard interpolation algorithms we&#39;ll use &quot;AI&quot; to do pretty much the same thing. Ie educated guesswork. You can&#39;t recover pixel data that isn&#39;t there in the first place.

Not that hard to require any remote exam to be done with the audio and video up and running so they can see you and hear you while you take the exam.

While it would not 100% defeat cheating, it should at least destroy the ease and convenience of doing it.

Bingo I think we can all admit that no matter ones feelings on remote-work that remote-testing is pretty silly that it was ever considered to work.

Even when I got my A+ cert as a teenager back when grunge was cool still I had to show up at a testing facility.

I have had testing centers send me cameras in the mail to take a test. This was for an online college, and they sent two cameras. One was meant to be mounted to the monitor and the other was supposed to be behind me but offset to the side a bit. They combined to give a full field of view of my desk and the surrounding room. This is a pretty good solution, and these cameras are quite cheap now. Requiring the user to pay for them so they don&#39;t have to come into the testing center isn&#39;t asking a lot.

I&#39;d imagine that millions of people will be getting bad tax advice from LLM&#39;s this year. These remote testers are just ahead of the curve!

What are they do when cyborgs take tests, just punish guys like Tank & Dozer?

Letting AI write your slashdot question and use the word &quot;stupidest&quot; instead of &quot;the most stupid&quot;.

That&#39;s the stupidest complaint I&#39;ve heard yet.

now it&#39;s choked with AI generated content as well.

The tripling of memory prices and watching the domino effect to any computer hardware that needs memory (but can&#39;t get adequate supplies) due to the hoovering up of nearly all the memory being produced by data centers used for AI projects.

That&#39;s the most stupid, and annoying thing about all this to me.  May this bubble pop, and quickly.

Clearly you don&#39;t understand supply and demand.

To start with...no one is producing consumer ram. No one. Everyone is focusing solely on high-end memory.

They have already stated they have zero intention of producing it again. None. Not one single person has said this will be over by summer...if anything...every company has said the shortages will continue in to 2027.

If no one makes it, there&#39;s nothing to sell. EVen if the bubble pops...it takes time to retool.

They quit producing consumer ram to meet the demands for AI. If you really think the corporations aren&#39;t going to take advantage of this; well I think we have a whole history of times where shortages lead to price increases that stayed permanent. The prices of everything went up 5 years ago...and did not go down when the supposed problems were solved. If those prices were high due to shortages, they should have dropped....but they didn&#39;t.

If they can get people paying $1500 a gig now...then why stop? You don&#39;t. You keep charging the stupid high rates and make them the new normal.

People can&#39;t buy computers if they can&#39;t get RAM. If they can&#39;t buy computers, then they&#39;ll be forced on to another option...like a hosted desktop. Then you have no options and no freedom....just a walled garden where every move you make can be watched.

Brand new motherboards and CPUs cost less than last years stuff; and last years stuff is getting stupid expensive. It&#39;s hit a wall. There&#39;s no incentive to sell new stuff because no one can use it. Can&#39;t afford the last generation because everyone is buying that instead.

By destroying the consumer side first...they can force everyone on to hosted platforms...where they&#39;ll ensure a revenue stream and make sure the bubble doesn&#39;t pop. Because right now the corporations have every incentive to invest every dollar they can because they know the future for them will be wage-free world of AI workers.

&quot;It might cost us a trillion now but it will save us trillions in the future&quot;

Funding AI companies, 1) whose demand for GPUs, SSDs and RAM drives up prices of computer hardware during a recession, so people can&#39;t upgrade, 2) which don&#39;t respect copyright.

And while at the same time asking people to upgrade their computers only so they can run a new version of your OS with new DRM (to enforce copyright) and with supposed AI features that nobody wants.

If AI wasn&#39;t here, do you think memory would still be as high priced, because something or the other would be used as an excuse?

Especially by those who are clueless what it actually is. How it works. How it can be useful. What to watch out for (hallucination, etc).

And watching the company execs who fired a bunch of people cos AI can &quot;do their work / help the other staff to do their work&quot;, and finding out a while later that they actually need those people back cos (surprise!) AI can&#39;t do the whatever work and they screwed up.

Environmentalism was never really on the table for corporations. Plenty of people are talking about the environmental impact of AI. What you seem to be realizing is that corporations don&#39;t give a fuck about society and will gladly fuck it over if they can get away with it and make more profit.

Oh wait, that was the dot-com bubble, I&#39;m getting bubbles mixed up.

That AI Village garbage [slashdot.org] we just read about yesterday is high on the list.

The media keeps calling that vending machine stupid, but in reality is is an experiment and not expected to work perfectly. Anthropic keeps updating and refining it, and they learned a lot in the process.

How is it not stupid? In what way is an AI vending machine the most efficient way to do anything, and not just a total waste of resources? Buying shit from Amazon on your smartphone takes fewer resources. A human worker who takes your order requires fewer resources.

We have narcissistic CEO types, tapping away in ChatGTP all day, and the LLMs are providing a narcissistic feedback loop. In public companies, axis 2 cluster b personalities tend to group in management, and with LLMs telling these maniacs that they&#39;re blessed with cosmic insights, management has become insufferable.

The only good benefit I have seen from AI is that marketing f***wits have all been laid off.

I imagine that anything accounting related, where AI is used to analyze data directly would be pretty stupid, but I think the dumbest thing that I have seen is this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]   real witness testimony generated by AI in a trial case.

You pay me $20 and I&#39;ll talk to it. Hmmm...$100 is more like it.

Builder.ai ended up being 700 remote workers in India pretending to be bots.  The exceptionally stupid part was the company&#39;s market cap of something like $1.5 Billion.  With that sort of &quot;due diligence&quot; going on I can imaging some over-zealous, greedy hedge fund manager investing $450 Million in a bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce after not stopping or slowing down to read the label completely.

When applying for a position at a corporation, if you are suddenly thrust into an A.I. driven job interview process. ABORT IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLAIN LOUDLY AND PROFUSELY.  Nothing quite so insulting as a corporation hiring but refusing to perform basic human interaction to find an appropriate candidate.

That may be true, but Ubisoft is in a bit of trouble.  Everyone&#39;s jobs are on the line, and there&#39;s no guarantee that performance will equal job security.  Are you familiar with the Tencent situation?

The only reason to form a union is if your employer is mistreating you.The other reason is you want to prevent mistreatment to happen based on 1) observation that it is happening in other companies in the same industry, and 2) it is likely to happen in yours as well if no force is set to push backwards preventively.

My dad was in IBEW and local electricians union, growing up he&#39;d often talk about how most weeks he had an apprentice with him to assist and shadow and learn.  The apprentice wasn&#39;t always employed at the actual company most times, they were provided for and paid (or partially paid) via the union although usually they would get hired out once they &quot;graduated&quot;.

Also the union had a pool of available members so if the company he was working for had a job that required extra work the company could get assistanc

In other news, cabin staff on Titanic also successfully formed a union to demand fair treatment 0115 on April 15 1912.

            <h2>One State Supreme Court’s Lazy “Shortcut” Erases Civil Rights</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/colorado-supreme-court-civil-rights-constitution.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This piece was originally published in the Behind the Bench newsletter on state constitutional law. Behind the Bench is published by the State Law Research Initiative.

It can be astonishing, and more than a little depressing, to see the lengths some courts go to avoid upholding basic constitutional rights. In June, I wrote about how the North Carolina Supreme Court’s Republican majority dilutes civil rights by requiring claimants to prove that challenged state actions, including discriminatory laws, are “unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.” The problem, as liberal Justice Anita Earls pointed out, is that “either the statute is consistent with the constitution or not,” and the “notion that you have to somehow establish that beyond a reasonable doubt makes no sense”—except, of course, as an excuse to erode civil rights.

Today, I bring your attention to the Colorado Supreme Court, which this month reaffirmed an inexplicable quirk of its excessive sentencing jurisprudence that preemptively extinguishes constitutional rights for entire categories of people. The court declares certain crimes to be “per se grave or serious,” which in practice means that no one convicted of such crimes can ever challenge their sentence, no matter its severity. The long-standing rule is both wholly illogical and blatantly unconstitutional (in the sense that it erases constitutional rights), but there is some good news: It appears that two justices are finally ready to, in their words, “deep six this concept.”

Colorado’s state constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual” punishment, including excessive or “disproportionate” prison terms. To assess excessive punishment claims, Colorado courts begin by comparing “the gravity or seriousness of the offense to the harshness of the penalty.” Normally, Colorado case law takes a relatively capacious view of how a crime’s “gravity” should be measured. It accounts not just for the offense and its elements but also for potentially mitigating factors such as whether the person “was an accessory, complicitor, or principal,” along with the person’s “culpability and motive.” In theory, this definition captures how personal characteristics (such as youth, disability, or addiction) and other circumstances (such as the role of group dynamics, poverty, or coercive relationships) might reduce someone’s culpability and factor into the constitutional analysis.

But for some offenses, the Colorado Supreme Court—and only the Colorado Supreme Court—has devised what it calls “the ‘per se’ shortcut.” Under this rule, the court “designate[s] certain crimes ‘per se grave or serious,’ ” which, the court says, renders a sentence all but “impervious to attack on proportionality grounds.” In other words, the court’s justices have decided they will not do their jobs for people who have certain convictions. Rather than actually assess excessive punishment claims in light of all the factors the law requires, they will just assume that these claims fail, giving prosecutors and legislators free rein to pursue the sort of punitive excess that has fueled mass incarceration for decades.

And it’s not like this rule has been reserved for what might intuitively be the most violent, high-culpability crimes. Robbery, for example, remains “per se grave or dangerous” even though the circumstances under which robberies take place vary wildly, as do the characteristics of the people who commit them (more on that below). Even worse, for nearly 30 years Colorado courts put all drug offenses, including mere possession, on this list until a “clarify[ing]” decision in 2019 finally changed that. (It took decades for the Colorado Supreme Court to realize that it “makes little sense to automatically treat the sale of a large quantity of cocaine by the leader of a drug cartel as equally grave or serious as the mere possession of a very small quantity of cocaine by a drug addict who is not involved in sale or distribution.”)

The court concedes that this “shortcut” is “unique to Colorado law” and that it “eliminates a longstanding layer of due process for criminal defendants.” Nonetheless, it remains on the books because it supposedly “saves time” and promotes “consistency.” I would submit that “saving time” is never a good reason to dispense with constitutional rights, but the court’s claims to efficiency are dubious in any case. Now, instead of properly analyzing its cruel and unusual clause, the court spends its time hopelessly trying to figure out what on earth “per se grave or serious” actually means and what offenses it applies to. With this rule in place, and with prosecutors thirsty to invoke it, the first part of every excessive punishment analysis turns into Tom Cruise cross-examining Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men: Q: “Grave Danger?” A: [Raises eyebrow] “Is there another kind?”

But there is a glimmer of hope. In People v. Kennedy, decided earlier this month, Justices Carlos Samour and Richard Gabriel “specially concurred” to advocate nixing the per se grave or serious shortcut.

In Kennedy, the court stood by its shortcut and upheld the 24-year prison term at issue. But it also held that vehicular homicide–DUI is not “per se grave or serious” because it is a strict liability crime with no specific intent element. “When a crime requires no proof of mens rea,” the court said, “it is impossible to evaluate the culpability of defendants convicted of the offense under every factual scenario.”

It is good that the court declined to expand the shortcut to cover a new offense, but the analytical problem here is that the same reasoning applies to crimes that do require proof of intent. To use an example mentioned above, the court thinks that people who commit robbery have sufficiently high culpability “under every factual scenario”—a conclusion that can only be understood as the willful ignorance of reality. Just a few other facts one might want to know: How old is the person? Are they a youth or emerging adult under age 25, and therefore more susceptible to peer pressure and impulsive decisionmaking? Was the person coerced by an abusive partner or authority figure? Did the person use a weapon and if so what kind? Was it a gun that turned out to be fake? Did the person act out of desperation? Was anyone physically harmed? The list goes on. To say that virtually no punishment could be unconstitutionally severe for all robbery convictions across all factual scenarios is absurd.

Justices Samour and Gabriel, at least, have started to push back. They argued that “easier and faster isn’t always better,” and that such “superficial proportionality review” is inappropriate when constitutional rights are at stake. Ultimately, they found “the drawbacks of per se designations far outweigh any purported benefits.”

Of course, Samour and Gabriel are right, but I’d add another critique: This constitutional “shortcut” makes absolutely no sense. Recall what it is ostensibly a shortcut to: comparing the gravity and/or seriousness of a criminal offense (including, per Colorado case law, characteristics of the offender) with the severity of the punishment imposed for it. In this context, neither “grave” nor “serious” is a bright-line, binary category. They exist along a spectrum. There is no being “not serious” up to a point before falling over a line into “seriousness.” This isn’t bankruptcy. This is a test about whether certain prison terms are too severe; one would think or at least hope that the Colorado Supreme Court is not perfectly fine with incarceration for wholly unserious crimes. To say that an offense is automatically “serious” or “grave,” therefore, means absolutely nothing, and it certainly doesn’t help understand if the resulting criminal punishment is fair.

What the court must mean, then, is that some crimes are sufficiently serious, but that only makes sense relative to the punishment imposed—a fact irrelevant to the court’s per se designation.

Perhaps I am thinking too hard about this. Such an arbitrary, court-created rule—born out of some combination of cowardly deference to extreme punishments and sheer laziness, and that even prosecutors agree is “a weird concept anyway”—doesn’t deserve that much credit. The point is: The Colorado Supreme Court’s rule, it turns out, is less a shortcut and more a barrier to protecting fundamental constitutional rights that should be torn down.

Only days remain until Zohran Mamdani ascends the throne of New York City, and nearly all his great opponents have given up. Andrew Cuomo, vanquished. Financier Bill Ackman, reduced to congratulations for the mayor-elect and even offers of support. Donald Trump, singing his praises after inviting him over to hang. Maybe the great socialist boogeyman isn’t so scary after all.

But not everyone is in the mood for total defeat. In a recent interview with Fox News, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman in Long Island announced a novel approach to combat the threat of socialism bearing down from America’s largest city: He is building a wall.

Mamdani, he said, “talks like he’s pro-criminal, not pro-victim.” And as such, in a last-ditch effort, Blakeman is going up with a wall on the border of Queens and Nassau counties, where New York City ends and what most think of as Long Island begins.

This makes plenty of sense. All truly great civilizations have a signature wall. China, for example. Also Donald Trump’s America. So why not Long Island? And this is not some archaic cinderblock and mortar contraption: It’s a top-of-the-line, high-tech fabrication.

“We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras,” Blakeman said in late November. “Nassau Exec Bruce Blakeman plans a wall of surveillance at NYC border after Mamdani win,” boasted the New York Post. So maybe not a Great Wall of China exactly, but certainly a wall with Chinese characteristics, given that an estimated 90 percent of surveillance cameras are made in China.

I appreciate the great works. But my request for a tour of the construction site was shot down; the county exec’s office gave me the elliptical redirect to watch Fox News. No one could tell me whether the wall was up or not. And the clock was ticking. So I headed for the borderlands, to watch the county batten down the hatches for the impending arrival of pro-criminal socialism, or else to delight in the last few days of open borders, Long Island–style.

I spoke with numerous sources in Long Island politics to pin down just where this wall might begin. The Queens–Nassau border is no small tract. To make matters worse, the border is effectively a stretch of highway, the Cross Island Parkway.

I began my tour at Bellerose Terrace, which I was told might be singled out as high priority. I got off at Jericho Turnpike. No surveillance wall in sight.

I stopped by the Bellerose Village Hall and asked for directions to the wall. A very kind woman working behind the desk straightened me out: I was being too literal.

“I think they’re talking about cameras,” she told me. But even so, she couldn’t point me to any new ones. “We haven’t seen any of that yet. They didn’t tell the village anything.”

The wall would be a crowning achievement of Blakeman’s tenure as county executive in Nassau. He has, in some sense, made Long Island into one of the world’s policing laboratories. In August, the county unveiled a $70 million police training village, replete with New York City–style homes, a church, a courtroom, a bar, and even a Long Island Rail Road–style station, where police run around doing what look a lot like combat exercises. Blakeman has also chartered a militia, hiring and deputized armed citizens for mobilization during emergency declarations. And now the wall.

Some would say that astronomical financial commitments to policing have gotten results. A 2024 U.S. News and World Report study found that Nassau County was one of the safest counties in America. Others would say that that same survey also found that the rest of the New York metropolitan area—aka crime-infested hellscape teeming with socialist policies—was similarly safe. Ten of the top 25 safest counties in the country were in New York metro, including Queens County and Brooklyn. The next year Blakeman announced even more police hires, and no more tax hikes to pay for them.

I got back on the Cross Island Parkway and headed for Elmont. This was another town, I was told, that had been identified for wall construction.

I saw a Nassau County Police Department squad car and talked to the officer inside. “That is coming from way more higher up than me,” he told me, of the wall implementation. He, too, was at a loss as to where I could identify some of these new cameras. “I mean, they could be up in any of the towers,” he said. Street lights and telephone poles and electrical wires were all fair game.

This abstracted wall, hung high in civilian infrastructure and currently invisible, couldn’t come at a more important time. With Elise Stefanik summarily bounced from the New York gubernatorial race after a swift falling out with Republican national political leadership, Blakeman is now likely to be the Republican standard bearer, in a race Republicans continue to tell themselves they can actually win because of the unpopularity of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, the fantastic ineptitude of the New York Democratic Party, and some anti-socialist backlash to the Mamdani ascendance. Republicans love to point out Blakeman won his most recent race by close to 12 percentage points in a county with over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. Trump has already endorsed him.

The result of Blakeman’s police push is that, obviously, the police budget is gargantuan. The 2025 budget of $4.2 billion doesn’t raise property taxes for the fourth year in a row, even though it adds over 50 new cops; over $1 billion of that is going to the police. He has boasted that he has hired 600 law enforcement officers and vetoed over $150 million in tax hikes, which would seem to spell financial trouble in the long run.

When asked how he would foot the bill for it all, Blakeman told Fox News it would come from civil asset forfeitures, an extremely controversial practice that allows law enforcement to seize property—including cash, cars, and assets like homes—from people merely suspected of being linked to crime, even without being charged or convicted. Some might say that they were going to pay for the wall by stealing from people in New York City.

I drove down to Valley Stream. Same story, no construction cones, no earth-moving, no camera crews. I stopped by another Nassau County Police Department office, where they instructed me to call the public affairs contact, who told me not only that he didn’t think they’d even started yet, but that he wasn’t “even sure they’re even gonna be allowed to do that.”

So maybe it was open borders after all. What else was there to do? I got back on the Cross Island Parkway, drove it north and south, crossed freely into Nassau and back into Queens. I counted preexisting security cameras as I went: three on a large gray tower on the west side of the parkway. One on decommissioned road work sign. One on a streetlight near the off-ramp. One more on another gray tower. Did I commit crimes all the way? Wouldn’t you like to know.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus is another entry in our occasional “Dear (Juris)Prudence” series, in which we invite listeners to ask their burning questions about the law and answer them as best we can. Write to amicus@slate.com to pose a question to Dahlia and Mark. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

What do we do about the Supreme Court? Several Supreme Court decisions over the past decade under John “ball-and-strikes” Roberts have not just reinterpreted laws but have effectively rewritten the Constitution such that many Democratic priorities are now effectively unconstitutional (gun control, campaign finance regulations, civil rights). Even a trifecta with a filibuster-proof majority cannot pass laws to address these issues. If you were put in charge of writing the Democrats’ Project 2029 Supreme Court chapter, what recommendations would you give to undo the damage this court has done that goes beyond waiting for the Grim Reaper?

Mark Joseph Stern: I’ve already laid out the blitz of executive actions that the next Democratic president needs to undertake immediately to undo the damage of Trumpism. But this question points toward an uncomfortable reality: To survive and endure, the next administration’s agenda must be accompanied by a suite of structural reforms that will, over time, make the Supreme Court more reflective of popular will. Congress absolutely needs to add states to the union, starting with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. That will ensure that rural red states like Wyoming and South Dakota are not so egregiously overrepresented. Remember, the senators who voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court represented fewer people than the senators who voted to oppose him. That is a huge structural problem that Congress can fix.

Now, any structural reforms that Congress enacts—including statehood for D.C.—need to include a provision stating that the Supreme Court cannot strike it down with a supermajority vote of 7–2. I am borrowing that idea from law professors Ryan D. Doerfler and Samuel Moyn. North Dakota and Nebraska actually have a version of this in their constitutions: Their state Supreme Courts can only strike down laws when a supermajority of justices finds them unconstitutional. I don’t think that’s such a bad idea. A supermajority requirement to invalidate legislation should be stuffed into everything Democrats do from here on out. Not just D.C. statehood, but campaign finance reform, gun safety laws, environmental regulations, civil rights. Put it in there that the law cannot be struck down unless seven justices agree that it’s unconstitutional.

I would also add a timing element, because this is one of the most insidious ways that the Supreme Court manipulates its docket. Think back to the Affordable Care Act: By the time SCOTUS weighed in, Democrats had lost their majority in the House of Representatives, so they would not have been able to repair whatever damage the court inflicted. There needs to be a time limit for judicial review built into all of these bills, combined with stringent limitations on forum shopping so that Matthew Kacsmaryk cannot immediately block them indefinitely. All legislation should require that any challenge must be commenced within, say, 30 days of the law’s enactment. And that challenge must be heard by a three-judge district court randomly drawn from around the country. Every bill should create an expedited appeals process and say that the Supreme Court must decide on the law’s constitutionality within one calendar year of passage—at which point Congress’ composition would presumably be the same.

What happens if the Supreme Court refuses to comply with all of this? The logical next step is to expand the court. Of course, Democrats could always choose to start with that, but I don’t think the political will is there quite yet. It seems to me that the first step needs to be a good-faith effort by Democrats to recalibrate the balance of power by reestablishing Congress’ primacy and diminishing the Supreme Court’s untouchable supremacy. If SCOTUS won’t allow that, then it’s time to add four seats.

That’s when the liberal justices need to aggressively restore constitutional democracy by ruthlessly overturning all of the worst decisions of the Roberts court. You know what I’m talking about: Dobbs, Shelby County v. Holder, Rucho v. Common Cause, all the bad voting-rights rulings, the affirmative action decision. The current Republican justices have already shredded adherence to precedent. A future liberal majority should say no to unilateral disarmament and apply the same rules. That is how Democrats put the court back in its place: by undoing its attacks on democracy and restoring the constitutional settlement the Roberts court has spent years dismantling. I think it’s something Democrats should be talking about right now.

During his first year back in office, President Donald Trump amassed an unprecedented amount of power in pursuit of his far-reaching agenda. His quests to crush the Democratic Party’s electoral power, seize control over the economy, and deport millions of immigrants were all actively abetted by the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices. Time and again—often over the shadow docket, with no explanation—the 6–3 supermajority cleared the path for Trump’s aggressive executive overreach. Those who believed that SCOTUS might serve as a modest check on the administration’s abuses were proved wrong almost weekly, as the court’s far-right bloc delivered win after win to the president it had helped return to the White House. The justices’ rare rebuke to Trump on Tuesday over his deployment of the National Guard in Chicago illustrated just how far outside the law this president must go before a majority is willing to tell him no.

On this week’s year-end episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern ponder the two big questions posed by this alliance: Why did the Supreme Court conservative supermajority align with Trump, and what consequences might it face for its choices? A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A year ago, we were operating under the theory that three of the six conservative justices were not all in for MAGA and genuinely cared about democracy. That was a mistake. Instead, what we have seen is the so-called center go all in for Trump, doubling and tripling down on the idea that this administration is like every other administration and any judge who tries to thwart it is a woke liberal—including fistfuls of Trump judges who aren’t auditioning for the Supreme Court. And just as the Supreme Court went after DOJ officials during Jack Smith’s prosecution of Donald Trump, it’s now going after judges who stand in the president’s way, suggesting that they are anti-Trump zealots suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” while we the justices are normal and must put a stop to it.

Why? It’s hard to believe that they go to cocktail parties with only the furthest of the far-right donors. It’s hard to believe that they don’t occasionally read the Washington Post or the New York Times. So what is going on? And this is the real thing I think we haven’t grappled with, but I’m not sure people who are watching the court have yet satisfactorily explained it, at least to my ears. What possible benefit is there to being the stewards of the MAGA destruction of America?

Mark Joseph Stern: My top-line thesis—and I want you to dispute it, because I don’t know if it’s entirely right—is that these justices have fully cast their lot with Trump and Trumpism. And a big part of Trumpism is antidemocratic, ensuring that political minorities can entrench their own power through undemocratic institutions like the Senate, the Electoral College, and the judiciary, as well as through voter suppression and assaults on democracy. Trumpism seeks to perpetuate a system that privileges the elites, the wealthy, white people, Christians, non-LGBTQ+ people. And I fear that the Supreme Court is now intertwined with that perception of who deserves power and who can legitimately exercise power—which is Trump and his GOP and their supporters. So it fills the need to protect Trump’s entire project from the direct forces of actual democracy.

That’s why one of the big pieces of this puzzle is voting rights. The Supreme Court is currently on the brink of delivering another blow to the Voting Rights Act in Callais v. Louisiana. It has been green-lighting voter suppression for so long. Just this month it reinstated Texas’ racial gerrymander that benefits Republicans. Any conversation of this kind needs to start there, because what we are seeing is the court trying to accelerate and facilitate the Trump agenda—and, on the other side of it, trying to ensure that the people can no longer shake loose this regime or really do anything to stop it and reverse what it has done, because there’s only one true way. It’s originalism and Trumpism, which are increasingly the same thing. And anyone who contests that is wielding an illegitimate claim to power. That justifies taking away voting rights and equal representation and democracy and whatever is necessary to ensure that what the regime’s doing now can just keep going forever.

When I started doing these New Year’s shows, it really struck me that we get absolutely caught up in individual big-ticket cases that weigh toward Trump and the culture wars, without looking at all the cases in the aggregate. When you’re covering the court, it is very easy to think, in the moment: The only case that matters is tariffs. Or transgender athletes. Or birthright citizenship. And, to be sure, every one of those cases is a blockbuster. But if you look at the big themes this year, you’re exactly right: It’s the voting cases. There are a lot of voting cases on the docket. We’ve talked about Callais and Texas’ gerrymander. There’s also campaign finance, plus a major case about mail ballots that the court will hear this term.

I think we really need to see the trend line, which is: The Supreme Court now has six votes to do anything it wants. And it is constantly taking cases about how people vote, where people vote, how their votes are counted, how campaigns are financed. While the big-ticket cases with huge social justice and racial justice implications do matter, it’s the democracy cases that have the biggest impact. We’re barreling into the midterms, and the 2028 election after that. And the way for the Supreme Court to achieve all the big-ticket items it wants is to make sure that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have a permanent majority.

By the way, these democracy cases don’t always get treated as seriously in the public conversation. They can be arcane; explaining campaign finance is a two-bourbon job right now. These are abstractions, and they can get devalued in the discourse. But we have to reckon with the fact that if you are a six-justice supermajority and you want to make sure you can do all the stuff you want to do for the next 10 or 20 years, you need to ensure that nothing will stop you, not even an election.

I do want to add that the birthright citizenship case, while absolutely a social justice issue, is also a democracy case. It’s about who counts as an American. And if the Trump administration gets its way, it would radically reduce the number of people who have a constitutional claim to birthright citizenship and are therefore able to participate in basic aspects of civic life. And that’s a theme that sounds in a lot of these other cases: Who gets to be a full and equal American citizen, and who gets something more like skim-milk citizenship? You see it in democracy cases and civil rights cases alike: Straight white men get the highest form of American citizenship. They can’t stop winning, while everybody else is losing.

That really does lead me to this stakes question, because we ask all the time on this show: What are the stakes for women? For LGBTQ+ communities? For immigrants? But I want to ask the question: What are the stakes for the Supreme Court? Because it seems to me we don’t think nearly hard enough about what is on the line for those six MAGA justices if they don’t shrink democracy enough to change electoral outcomes.

I think they have reached a point of no return, and they are scared of what happens if the political winds switch direction. At least some of them must understand that they have failed to act as independent jurists. In the mind of a majority of Americans, they are a political body, and as I said, they have cast their lot with Trumpism. If they had spent the past year truly standing up to Trump from time to time, I don’t think they’d have as much to fear from Republicans losing political power. I doubt there would be as much Democratic appetite for Supreme Court reform, including term limits and court expansion.

The Republican-appointed justices could have played this smarter if their goal was to stave off Democratic backlash. Giving Trump just 25 percent more losses would have given a lot of people the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the court was more or less doing its job. Americans want to see one branch stand in the way of another when it looks like there is an abuse of power. At this point, though, the justices have gone too far down this road to turn around. And they should be worried, because there is a very real chance that the entire Trumpist project will fall apart. And they are now so intertwined with Trumpism that they might collapse with it. That’s why it is so important for them to weaponize these democracy cases. There may come a time when the only way they can maintain their grasp on power is to oppress the majority.

Over the past calendar year, the Supreme Court’s center has shifted to the right and then more to the right, and the justices’ decisions have time and again facilitated Trump’s agenda. But the Roberts majority is not simply focused on what the current president wants; it has its sights set on a larger project: voting. Suppressing and constraining and problematizing the core function of democratic rule.

In this episode, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern reflect on the significant developments at the Supreme Court over the past year with an eye toward the implications of the court’s decisions on democracy, voting rights, and the erosion of checks and balances. Looking back at the past year at One First Street, Dahlia and Mark trace the cases that reveal the court’s long game, with elections coming quickly, and discuss the forces for and against democracy being exerted within and without the high court. Then, they turn to the urgent matter of what you and I can do about it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2005, YouTube has gone from launching its first website to serving up more than 100,000 years&#39; worth of video content every day. During the same period, the State of California has gone from the idea of adopting a single ERP, HCM, and procurement platform to getting nearly all of its departments on board – although there are still a few stragglers.

In 2021, 16 years after the implementation was first proposed, the final functionality was deployed to FI$Cal, the statewide finance system. The following year, the legislature judged that all the project&#39;s objectives had been met. Just why it took the same time as a startup like YouTube to achieve world domination tells us a lot about enterprise software, and especially its role in government: it&#39;s harder than it looks.

FI$Cal – short for Financial Information System for California – combines financial planning, accounting, budgeting, cash management, and procurement. Its builders believe that it is one of the largest public-sector IT systems in the world. Given that most national governments would rely on separate departmental systems, and that California is the world&#39;s fourth-largest economy, the claim may not be so far-fetched.

Based on PeopleSoft, acquired by Oracle for $10.3 billion in January 2005, and Hyperion, which Oracle bought for $3.3 billion in 2007, FI$Cal supports approximately 16,000 end users in 151 departments that use the system to pay their bills and balance their budgets every day. It processed $453 billion in spending in fiscal 2023-2024 while the State Treasurer&#39;s Office system functionality handled more than $2.9 trillion in state government banking transactions in the same period.

Although the rollout is officially complete, new challenges continue to arise. As well as finding the right time for six deferred departments to adopt the system, the team must manage the Department of Justice&#39;s plan to go live in 2027 and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) project to adopt the system in 2028.

The California Government Code Section 11865 determines future developments in FI$Cal – specifically, onboarding deferred departments, continuing technical optimization, and maintaining system security. It is also set to support the transition of the accounting book of record for the State of California to the FI$Cal system by the July 2026 statutory deadline.

FI$Cal, also the name of the department that manages the system, is developing and implementing an onboarding schedule for each deferred department including tasks, training, analysis, and touchpoints to prepare the department and transition them to the &quot;new&quot; system. This process includes an analysis in the early stages in the form of a fit/gap report and a master departmental workplan.

FI$Cal works with departments before, during, and after the onboarding process. It anticipates a learning curve of around three years for all newly onboarded departments, throughout which it supports these departments.

The idea of the FI$Cal system was first proposed when the Department of Finance needed to replace its budgeting system, which originated in 1984 and ran on IBM Power8 servers using the IBM iSeries operating system. After the 2005 feasibility report, the California government expanded the project to modernize the state&#39;s entire financial management processes into a single financial management system. Seven years after the project was first proposed, in 2012, a systems integrator was brought onboard and implementation work started in earnest (see timeline for more detail).

According to FI$Cal, a cloud-first policy is now in place. This means it considers cloud solutions before making any new investments. It aims to take advantage of cloud technology to help with resilience and flexibility. Using a phased approach, it has been replacing system infrastructure with cloud services for the past few years. During its first phase, it implemented a cloud-based disaster recovery environment for the FI$Cal system and migrated back-office systems and services to the cloud. It is currently in the second phase and is working to migrate the main FI$Cal system to cloud-based infrastructure.

&quot;Our goal is to complete this migration before we have to upgrade the current hardware, avoiding significant capital expenses to replace our hardware,&quot; FI$Cal said in a statement to The Register. &quot;We are already using cloud-based infrastructure to support onboarding new departments and to test new functionalities. The last phase in our journey to the cloud will be to determine a feasible and cost-effective strategy to transition our core software to a cloud software-as-a-service model, where such a model would provide benefits to the state.&quot;

California is not alone in facing the challenge of moving from PeopleSoft to a SaaS application for HR, finance, and payroll.

Akshara Naik Lopez, a senior analyst at Forrester, said that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, PeopleSoft was a popular system for so-called SLED entities in the United States. These State, Local, and Education government organizations – of which there are around 90,000 – often took the opportunity to add customizations on top of the vanilla solution to suit their specialized requirements.

&quot;If they&#39;re using the entire HCM, including payroll, they are more than likely to customize it. Some are also using time and labor applications, which can be very complex. The more complex ones are not easy to undo and figure out how to do it in a SaaS product,&quot; she said.

&quot;What&#39;s happening with a lot of SLED entities is they&#39;ve done the traditional cycle right every three to five years of setting budget aside and doing an upgrade project. What we are seeing is a lot of these SLED entities, when they&#39;re due for an upgrade, you will see their HR heads and CTOs and the budget office trying to figure out, &#39;Is it time for that entity to consider SaaS?&#39;&quot;

PeopleSoft is not the future direction of travel for Oracle ERP, HCM, and financial management software. Big Red currently markets its Fusion SaaS application suite, hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, for enterprise organizations and NetSuite for medium-sized enterprises. Fortunately for the sizable army of US public sector users, the support cut-off for PeopleSoft is long. Unlike SAP – which is mandating end-of-2027 and 2030 depending on what you pay – Oracle has announced it will support PeopleSoft until the end of 2035.

&quot;We have extended support annually for the last six years, and will continue to do so until Oracle&#39;s strategy and support for PeopleSoft changes,&quot; Oracle veep Rebekah Jackson said in a blog post.

Nonetheless, users will have to make the move at some point. Although Oracle says it continues to enhance PeopleSoft, the last full application release, 9.2, came out in 2013.

&quot;The difficult question that users face is whether SaaS HCM and finance vendors can prove to them that their application can support their needs out of the box,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;Most likely, they won&#39;t, but they can also see if it is configurable enough with the help of the product vendor and systems integrator to provide a core application, without any add-on solutions that they then have to integrate.&quot;

Modern SaaS vendors in this market, such as Workday, have low-code and no-code environments with which they can adapt the standard application. But to do that they need to figure out what their existing application actually does, a challenging enough task in itself.

Another option is to move the PeopleSoft applications to a hyperscaler, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or OCI, where they can add automation and AI onto their existing applications.

&quot;You can run on-prem PeopleSoft applications on AWS or OCI. AWS offers phenomenal add-on AI capabilities. There are options available, even from &#39;on-prem or non-SaaS options,&#39;&quot; Lopez said.

Given how long it took California&#39;s state government to move onto PeopleSoft in the first place, even with generous lead time, organizations might want to start planning soon.

Iain Saunderson, chief technology officer at Spinnaker Support, said that despite the long lead time for support and updates, the PeopleSoft install base is dwindling. &quot;I don&#39;t think Oracle&#39;s selling very many new installations of PeopleSoft,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;Users are probably moving off PeopleSoft very gradually. The customers are going to be there for the next decade but if I was a CEO running a PeopleSoft installation, I would probably need to figure out what&#39;s going to come next. I don&#39;t have to act on it today, but you know, I&#39;m not going to get all the latest and greatest features and just new enhancements where I am.&quot;

FI$Cal kindly provided some of the details for this article. The Register asked a number of follow-up questions about the technical stack, the systems integrator, and the costs. We&#39;re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, FI$Cal offered a prepared statement.

Bret Ladine, director of FI$Cal, said: &quot;FI$Cal continues to hit key milestones and enable efficiencies throughout state government. This progress can be attributed to applying lessons learned from FI$Cal&#39;s early years, effective collaboration between FI$Cal and its partners, and legislative oversight that provided a clear roadmap, which FI$Cal is following closely.&quot;

The Register will follow FI$Cal&#39;s progress closely too, because the roadmap is not the territory and others in the US public sector are likely to embark on the same journey in the next few years.

Forrester&#39;s Lopez said some of the projects had been on hold, but that wouldn&#39;t last. &quot;We are already seeing a lot of RFP activity going on in the SLED client base across the United States, and we&#39;ll continue to see them.&quot;

Thousands of US public sector bodies might have a long history with PeopleSoft, but the hard years lie ahead. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Feature More than half a century ago, a consortium of European aerospace businesses from the UK, France, Germany and Spain joined forces to take on America&#39;s Boeing. Fast forward to the 21st century and the countries are applying the same model needs to the world of cloud computing, giving the continent a fighting chance to reduce the digital domination of Big Tech.

It took Airbus decades to compete with rivals on a global stage, achieving an operating profit only at the end of 1990. Due to the success of the A320, it reported an overall net profit five years later. Long-term thinking, as is more typical in China, is how Catherine Jestin, executive vice president of digital at Airbus, views what&#39;s needed now.

There are some big players in Europe, albeit not in the same ballpark as AWS, Microsoft, or Google. &quot;If we are able to build on them, maybe we have a chance to reach - not tomorrow, but maybe in one or two decades - something that is getting closer,&quot; she told The Register.

&quot;It&#39;s a long game,&quot; she added. &quot;And if you look at the way China is approaching it, it takes time. It takes political will and the alignment of the industry. Easier to attain in China than in Europe.&quot;

Digital sovereignty isn&#39;t a new topic, though under Trump 2.0, interest in the subject continues to balloon. This isn&#39;t lost on the big three US cloud giants. Despite their size, they&#39;re moving quickly to protect their patch. Europe represents big business for them, and with the safety of hosted data a priority for customers in the region, AWS, Microsoft, and Google are promoting their own digitally sovereign services.

President Trump has created mistrust of American institutions in Europe. The US - once seen as the leader of the free world - isn&#39;t perceived this way now. The CLOUD Act further sows the seeds of doubt, worrying customers about US authorities getting access to their data. The International Criminal Court incident, when the ICC chief stopped being able to access email after he was sanctioned by Trump, has left some wondering if they&#39;ll find themselves in the same boat.

AWS, Microsoft, and Google insist these fears are blown out of all proportion.

Jestin says lawyers still haven&#39;t come back with a definitive answer to the question of whether customers in Europe are immune to extraterritorial laws, when using their digitally sovereign services.

Over-reliance on America is something GAIA-X was founded to address. The European Commission-backed initiative was conceived in 2019, the brainchild of France and a more cautious Germany that wanted to back a digital champion, but not at the cost of upsetting trade relations with the US.

Jestin, who is chairwoman at GAIA-X, says it was never the organization&#39;s intent to fund a European David to take on the Goliaths in the US. &quot;The idea was more to foster the creation of it and to put in place the conditions for this to emerge. This has not been completely successful.&quot;

&quot;I think that the creation of Airbus was a political decision,&quot; she added. &quot;What we were missing at the launch of GAIA-X was this backing from political institutions. And there were probably too many people and companies that wanted to become champions. The number of players is just too high.&quot;

Just as Europe has started to find common ground in defense, so too is it finding some unification in the provision of sovereign data spaces. Signs of this were evident at the Franco-German Digital Sovereignty Summit in Berlin on November 18, an event focused on AI, the cloud, chips, and using open source software to create an independent digital infrastructure.

However, just as the US supports its tech companies with IT contracts in the federal sector, governments across Europe need to put their money where their mouth is and start backing local IT providers. At present, more than 70 percent of cloud computing contracts in Europe go to the big three. That needs to change, says Jestin.

&quot;If the European governments only rely on private funding and hope that all the European large organizations will be the ones funding the creation of a champion, we will not be successful. It has to be joined together. We will have to make choices. We need to pick a few players, bet on them, invest in them, and bring public funding.&quot;

Not subsidies, but government service contracts.

Thiebaut Kleiner, director of Future Networks at DG Connect at the European Commission, who was among the attendees at the event in Berlin, spoke on stage at the GAIA-X conference in Porto during November, which The Register attended.

The &quot;problem,&quot; he said at the event, is that many European tech providers might be national or not have the scale of &quot;international competitors&quot; and so are less visible. But the concept of a &quot;European technology stack where we complement each other&quot; is &quot;exciting.&quot;

Technological sovereignty should be discussed more widely at the next European Council, Kleiner said. &quot;But in the future, we should not even ask ourselves. We should simply do it and really use European providers first.&quot;

GAIA-X has itself taken six years to create a framework for digital sovereignty. It&#39;s a complex, multi-faceted initiative that involves four layers denoting varying levels of digital sovereignty compliance, each with increasingly stricter conditions.

The strictest requirement, Level 3, necessitates corporations be headquartered in Europe to truly offer data solutions that can be considered digitally sovereign under the sovereignty index. Level 3 will be applicable to circa 10 percent of customers in the region who need this level of data sovereignty guarantee. Military and highly regulated industries will opt for this, and it likely won&#39;t come cheap.

Industries including aviation, automotive, and nuclear are among those creating data spaces - a standardized software platform to exchange sensitive data digitally in a protected way between suppliers for collaboration purposes. This is about demonstrating compliance with the principles of digital sovereignty. More than 150 projects in total are underway, although only a handful of the data spaces are operational today.

Companies in the finance, agricultural, and pharmaceutical sectors are also making progress in this respect. The concept is intended to comprise all suppliers that work in a specific vertical market. Airbus, for example, works with 10,000 suppliers globally in the design and production of aircraft. French energy provider EDF is building six new nuclear plants and is creating a data space for 2,500 suppliers in its ecosystem that will help to build and manage the nuclear facilities.

&quot;It&#39;s coming, slowly,&quot; said Jestin of the data space proliferation.

With much of the technology in the world produced outside of Europe, it isn&#39;t realistic to rely on a European stack now. But the idea, via the European CHIPS Act and related initiatives, is to nurture the creation of one over time.

American companies are trying to partner with European digital providers - Google with Thales in France, Google with T-Systems in Germany, and Microsoft with Orange and Capgemini in France. These alliances are not perfect, says Jestin, but they are also an opportunity.

&quot;I see that as an opportunity to develop skills, to develop knowledge, and that&#39;s a little bit like what Airbus did after the Second World War. We learned about aeronautics by working under license of US products. And then, thanks to that, we were able to develop our own skills and industry around it. So I see that also as a way for Europe to really understand and build skills, build competencies, and maybe tomorrow, build something that will be able to compete.&quot;

American and Chinese big tech are members of the working group of GAIA-X and can influence the standards, but they &quot;respect the rules of the association,&quot; said Jestin. They are not on GAIA-X&#39;s board, which is comprised only of Europeans tasked with making the strategic decisions.

Minutes of every meeting where decisions are made are publicly available for transparency purposes, and Jestin urges detractors to take a look. Achieving certification to provide GAIA-X label Level 3 - 100 percent digital sovereignty - requires service providers to be headquartered in Europe.

AWS is itself setting up a European organization, so will it comply? &quot;My view is, at this stage, I still don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Jestin. &quot;I know that they claim they are immune to extraterritorial laws. I still don&#39;t understand how it is possible. And for me, if they are still subject to extraterritorial laws, they will be excluded from Level 3, because that is the big criteria.&quot;

Lawyers are working on this review process.

Forrester senior analyst Dario Maiso told The Register that the tech market remains &quot;heavily dependent on hyperscalers,&quot; with some 70 percent of the cloud market in the hands of the big three.

&quot;Their clients are already accustomed to cloud migrations, so as sovereign solutions become available, it is likely that one of the preferred ways to realize sovereignty will be to migrate from the non-sovereign to the sovereign solution of the hyperscaler.

&quot;However, we also see clients switching from hyperscalers to local cloud vendors at a cost to get rid of the dependency on foreign jurisdictions. This opens up a more complex problem though, as clients will have to migrate the SaaS stack and the workspace suite too, something that is sometimes not even technically possible.&quot;

GAIA-X has amassed a catalog of services - 600 as of November - provided by fifteen European service providers, and these will be used to create the data spaces. The services will be selected based on the four security levels specified.

The data spaces concept, based on the GAIA-X sovereignty index, is also being exported to Japan, Korea, Brazil, and Canada. This framework, we&#39;re told, respects local legislation but enables global interoperability of data.

One country that has yet to show firmer interest is the UK. GAIA-X CEO Ulrich Ahle says GAIA-X has not made real progress there in the past three years, despite some discussions with officials from the UK government.

&quot;So far, we have not established the right contacts in the UK to really get the support from the government. And from my perspective, we have not been successful yet to convince the UK on the benefits of data spaces as an enabler to create sovereign data operations,&quot; he told us.

The UK was one of the major forces behind the creation of Airbus, and yet the country continues to award public sector contracts to US hyperscalers. Central government departments have 41 live contracts with AWS alone, totaling £1.1 billion. More agreements are headed in the direction of AWS, including a £600 billion contract from HMRC, with additional departments distributing tenders.

With European leaders admitting it will take years for European cloud providers to get the scale to compete, there is a risk that AWS, Microsoft, and Google will have an even tighter stranglehold on the sector.

Ernst Stoeckl-Pukall, head of unit digitization and industrie 4.0 at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany, said at the GAIA-X event in November that he is &quot;totally committed&quot; to GAIA-X, that it is about a federation, interoperability, and &quot;strong communities.&quot;

That said, he admitted Europe does not yet have a &quot;strong decision process&quot; across the continent to push GAIA-X forward and this is &quot;why we lose so much speed.&quot;

It may be that too many factions have a vested interest in promoting their national digital champions.

&quot;We will need to make choices,&quot; said Jestin. &quot;And maybe we will need to make joint ventures and create associations.&quot;

&quot;When we created Airbus more than 50 years ago, it was a political decision to take the German champions, the French champions, the Spanish champions, the UK champion, and bring them together. And maybe we need to do that on digital also and pick a few big players and ask them to work together for a goal that is going beyond their current mission.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if it is feasible - maybe I am just dreaming - but I think that is the way it needs to work, because otherwise there are too many players who will try to get the support.&quot;

One thing is certain: with Trump in the White House for three more years at least, the topic of digital sovereignty won&#39;t be going away anytime soon. ®

            <div id="article-text">On Call Y2K Welcome to a special festive season edition of On Call, in which we share readers&#39; stories of working on the 31st of December 1999 – the moment the tech world held its breath and hoped years of Year 2000 bug remediation efforts would work.

Let&#39;s start with a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Graham&quot; who at the time worked at a cable television network operated by a giant US telco.

Midnight passed without incident for Graham, but at 0010 an actual manifestation of the Y2K bug appeared.

&quot;There was a problem with an old character generator that used an 80286 processor,&quot; Graham wrote. &quot;The clock had stopped at midnight and the machine just froze.&quot;

Graham and his team spent months preparing for Y2K and sprang into action, then relaxed again when the borked box resumed operations after a simple reboot.

&quot;One interesting and unanticipated problem was people shooting weapons,&quot; Graham told on Call. &quot;In at least one case a merrymaker shot a distribution amplifier, knocking out cable for their neighbors. There was some discussion as to whether to include the outage on the Y2K dashboard or not.&quot;

Now let&#39;s meet another reader we&#39;ll call &quot;Kerry&quot; who worked for a University that ordered all computers machines be turned off for Y2K eve.

Kerry&#39;s job saw him manage a fleet of Unix servers, and he decided to ignore that instruction.

&quot;I was confident that nothing serious would go wrong and that my users could continue to work from home,&quot; he told On Call.

Kerry therefore went home and prepared for the millennium eve party he intended to host.

&quot;At around 4pm everything electrical stopped working,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;I felt the bottom drop out from under me. Were the doomsday predictions true?&quot;

&quot;I quickly found out the out that my neighbors did not have the same problem,&quot; Graham told On Call. &quot;The main fuse of my house had blown because we were using way too much power.&quot;

And when he returned to work the following week, all was well – other than the banner page on print jobs dated &quot;Monday January 3 1900.&quot;

Now let&#39;s meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Rob&quot; who at the time of Y2K worked for Sun Microsystems in the UK.

As a global company, Sun had an early warning system for any Y2K problems: Its Australian office was 11 hours ahead of the UK office, so if any problems struck there, the company would get advance notice.

Which is why, as midnight neared Down Under, Rob&#39;s boss called Sun&#39;s Sydney office … then heard the phone line go terrifyingly silent as the clock ticked pas midnight. Rob said that &quot;scared the hell out of my manager&quot; – at least for a few moments, because the phone soon rang.

&quot;It was the Australian office, laughing their heads off,&quot; Rob told On Call. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">IBM has announced the death of its former CEO Lou Gerstner, who passed away on Saturday, aged 83.

In his biography, “Who Says Elephants Can&#39;t Dance?” Gerstner recounted his middle-class upbringing and time at Dartmouth University and Harvard Business School. At 23, he went to work for management consultancy McKinsey and within nine years became a senior partner before taking a senior role at American Express.

During his 11 years at American Express, Gerstner had his first encounter with IBM when one of the divisions he oversaw adopted computers from Amdahl in addition to its Big Blue mainframes. IBM threatened to withdraw support for its hardware. Gerstner tried to contact IBM’s CEO, only to be met with bureaucratic indifference despite American Express being a very significant customer at the time.

“Cooler heads prevailed at IBM and the incident passed,” he wrote. “Nevertheless, it did not go out of my memory.”

Gerstner next became CEO of RJR Nabisco, a chastening experience as its new venture capitalist owners demanded performance the business was not set up to deliver. After four years in the job, he began to contemplate his next move. IBM’s leadership was the subject of speculation at the time, and Johnson & Johnson CEO Jim Burke reached out to Gerstner and suggested he express interest in the job.

The idea appealed and Gerstner engaged with IBM, but after seeing the state of its books and product strategy, he decided not to seek the role.

Burke persisted and told Gerstner “You owe it to America to take the job.” He and others convinced Gerstner that his work at American Express meant he had the experience to reform IBM, and that his approach of focusing on business fundamentals – strong cashflow and focusing on customers’ needs – would be applicable.

Gerstner decided IBM was a great challenge, took the job, and started work in April 1993.

The New York Times reported his appointment with the headline “Task of Turning Around I.B.M. Is Given to an Industry Outsider.”

In a letter sent to IBM staff and posted online, current IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote that Gerstner “arrived at IBM at a moment when the company’s future was genuinely uncertain.”

“The industry was changing rapidly, our business was under pressure, and there was serious debate about whether IBM should even remain whole,” Krishna wrote. “His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”

“One of Lou’s earliest signals as CEO has become part of IBM lore. Early on, he stopped a long internal presentation and said, simply, ‘Let’s just talk.’ The message was clear: less inward focus, more real discussion, and much closer attention to customers. That mindset would define his tenure.”

Krishna said Gerstner believed IBM “had lost sight of a basic truth of business: understanding the customer and delivering what the customer actually values,” and changed that attitude.

“Meetings became more direct. Decisions were grounded more in facts and client impact than in hierarchy or tradition. Innovation mattered if it could translate into something clients would come to rely on. Execution in the quarter and the year mattered, but always in service of longer-term relevance.”

Gerstner also made many more IBM staff eligible to earn stock options, decided to integrate IBM’s siloed business units, and created its first services and consulting operations that offered business strategy and worked with technologies beyond Big Blue’s own stack. That business, IBM Global Services, became a powerhouse. He also embraced openness, allowing IBM software to run on third-party platforms and rival software vendors to code for Big Blue’s boxes.

He expressed those strategies through acquisitions such as the 1995 deal to buy Lotus for $3.5 billion – then the biggest-ever software deal – and the $743 million purchase of Tivoli in 1996. Buying Lotus gave IBM an entry into the emerging market for custom networked applications running on PCs. Tivoli gave its consulting arm tools to manage diverse IT estates.

Gerstner’s acquisitions and strategies changed IBM’s culture and helped it surf the mid-1990s wave of internet adoption to grow revenue by around $20 billion a year on his watch. The company also enjoyed strong share price growth.

But the CEO didn’t believe in internet hype.

In the year 2000, The Register obtained an internal IBM memo in which Gerstner explained that he bet the company on e-business, which he believed was “changing the entire basis of the global economy.”

Gerstner observed the sky-high stock market valuations of early internet companies, the CEOs replicating their strategies, and dismissed it all as “dot-com alchemy.”

“How long it will continue, or why it is so often unreasoned, I wouldn&#39;t venture to say,” he wrote in the memo. “But I&#39;m certain that is not the game for most CEOs – whether their companies are smokestacks or dot-coms. For us, the game is to do the hard work of accelerating the transformation of our fundamentals – to understand that the Net isn&#39;t really about short-term stock performance but long-term stock and business performance.”

“Of course, not all companies have been seduced by the lure of the magic market-cap wand. Many are hard at work creating alternate distribution channels, reinventing – not just spinning off – their supply chains, and more. This is a period of extraordinary change, with extraordinary opportunities. But we can&#39;t seize them through dot-com alchemy.”

When Gerstner left IBM in 2002, it was in better shape than he found it. He even earned an honorary knighthood.

There were casualties along the way: Gerstner presided over tens of thousands of job cuts. The CEO misread consumer and business enthusiasm for PCs, allowing Compaq and Dell to overtake the market it pioneered, and Microsoft to dominate the market for PC operating systems to the extent that IBM gave up on OS/2. Those decisions gave Microsoft and Dell an entry to enterprise computing that both have used to surpass IBM’s revenue and influence. IBM also lost leadership in networking, storage, processor design, and saw x86 servers drive its mainframe and midrange business into niche markets. And IBM Global Services became surplus to requirements in 2020, when it was spun out as part of Kyndryl.

After leaving IBM, Gerstner focused on philanthropy, especially regarding education, and serving on boards. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Korean e-tailer Coupang claims a former employee has admitted to improperly accessing data describing 33 million of its customers, but says the accused deleted the stolen data.

In a post published on Christmas, Coupang revealed it worked with Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, and Ernst & Young, to conduct a forensic investigation into the incident, and has also secured sworn statements from the alleged perpetrator.

The investigation and testimony mean Coupang believes the perpetrator stole a security key while working at the company and later used it to access customer records.

According to Coupang’s report, the alleged perp looked up “roughly 3,000” customers’ order histories and building access codes, a data point used so delivery workers can place packages inside apartment blocks.

Investigators found the alleged perp accessed the data using a PC and a MacBook Air. The accused surrendered the PC, and investigators found the script used to run the attack on one of its hard drives.

After media reported the attack, the accused decided to destroy evidence of his activity, and therefore smashed his MacBook Air, stuffed it in a Coupang canvas bag along with some bricks, and threw it into a river.

An aside: In 2011, before joining The Register, your correspondent wrote a story about data recovery and spoke to a forensics expert who advised using salt water to destroy evidence because it does more damage to electronics than fresh water. That story may have been useful to the accused because after he revealed his actions, investigators found the laptop in the river and were able to read its serial number – which matched the serial number of the accused’s iCloud account.

Coupang’s post says the alleged perpetrator “only” retained data describing roughly 3,000 accounts, never moved it off his PC and MacBook Air, and deleted it all after seeing news reports about his actions.

“The investigative findings to date are consistent with the perpetrator’s sworn statements and found no evidence that contradicts these statements,” Coupang’s post states.

Coupang’s account of the incident suggests its impact was relatively limited, a welcome assertion as South Korea’s population is around 52 million – meaning the attack affected more than half of the nation’s residents.

Coupang remains in a world of pain. On Monday the company announced that it will gift 33 million customers whose data the alleged perp accessed a ₩50,000 ($35) voucher, an effort that will cost it $1.17 billion. South Korea’s government has commissioned an inquiry into the company’s operations, which – if the data leak at Korean carrier SK Telecom is a precedent – will result in substantial fines. ®

            <div id="article-text">Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.

The draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”

As is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.

One Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:

Providers shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.

Providers are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.

The draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.

Also among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users&#39; psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”

The draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.

The Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.

Australia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”

“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”

Australia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”

The Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”

Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.

The agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.

The rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.

57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.

Working with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.

Nikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.

Papua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.

PNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.

On December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.

On Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”

It’s almost the new year and time to treat yourself to a new pair of earbuds — especially if one of your resolutions for 2026 is to work out more. If you find yourself reading this and nodding, take a look at the Beats Powerbeats Fit, a recent upgrade of Beats’ Fit Pro earbuds that feature a redesigned wing tip. They are now on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H for about $179.99, which is $20 off their usual $199.99 price and the lowest they’ve gone so far.

According to the company, the new tips have more flexibility in order to improve comfort while keeping the earbuds more securely anchored in your ears. While these mid-level earbuds still use the H1 chips (the Powerbeats Pro 2 and the AirPods Pro 3 are equipped with Apple’s newer H2 wireless chip), they have most of the features you’d look for, whether you’re using them with an iPhone (hands-free Siri access, Find My tracking, and syncing across Apple devices through iCloud) or an Android phone (one-touch pairing and location tracking through the Beats mobile app, along with customizable controls).

A new version of the Fit Pro wireless earbuds, which are upgraded with a redesigned wing tip that Beats says is 20 percent more flexible, a smaller case, and other advantages.

In addition, they offer active noise cancellation, an IPX4 rating, and seven hours of playback (six hours with ANC turned on). Read our coverage.

            <div id="article-text">The depth-defying lens can focus on multiple objects at different distances.

The depth-defying lens can focus on multiple objects at different distances.

A camera lens, historically, can only focus on one thing at a time, just like the human eye. That could be a thing of the past, though, thanks to a breakthrough lens technology developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that can bring every part of a scene into sharp focus, capturing finer details across the entire image, no matter the distance.

Traditional lenses are limited to sharpening one focal plane (the distance between an object and your camera) at a time, blurring everything behind or in front of that object. That effect can bring a sense of depth to images, but seeing a full picture clearly typically requires you to combine multiple photographs that were shot at different focal lengths. This new “spatially-varying autofocus” system instead combines a mix of technologies that “let the camera decide which parts of the image should be sharp — essentially giving each pixel its own tiny, adjustable lens,” according to CMU associate professor Matthew O’Tool.

The researchers developed a “computational lens” that combines a Lohmann lens — two curved, cubic lenses that shift against each other to tune focus — with a phase-only spatial light modulator — a device that controls how light bends at each pixel — allowing the system to focus at different depths simultaneously. It also uses two autofocus methods: Contrast-Detection Autofocus (CDAF), which divides images into regions that independently maximize sharpness, and Phase-Detection Autofocus (PDAF), which detects whether something is in focus and which focal direction to adjust.

The experimental system “could fundamentally change how cameras see the world,” according to CMU professor Aswin Sankaranarayanan.

It isn’t available in any commercial camera you can actually buy, and it may be some time before options start appearing on the market, if ever. CMU researchers suggest that this tech could have broader applications beyond traditional photography, however, including improved efficiency in microscopes, creating lifelike depth perception for VR headsets, and helping autonomous vehicles to see their surroundings with “unprecedented clarity.”

            <div id="article-text">From steamy romance to surreal animated comedy, HBO has a little bit of everything to watch this holiday season.

From steamy romance to surreal animated comedy, HBO has a little bit of everything to watch this holiday season.

With all the drama surrounding Warner Bros. Discovery’s plans to sell itself to another company, it’s not currently clear how much longer HBO Max will continue to exist in its current form. But for the time being, the streamer is chock full of solid series you might want to consider watching if you find yourself bored, chilly, and firmly planted on your couch this holiday season. Whether it’s superhero madness, dark satire, or steamy romance, HBO Max has a little bit of everything. And the streamer has a whole lot more coming down the pipeline, so now’s the time to check out some of what it had to offer in 2025.

At a time when it often feels like TV is shying away from sex in favor of more family friendly stories that appeal to Gen Z’s modest tastes, Heated Rivalry — an adaptation of Rachel Reid’s Game Changers novels — feels like a breath of fresh (and steamy) air. It’s a classic frenemies-to-forbidden lovers romance set against the backdrop of professional ice hockey. But as spicy as the series is, it’s also a strong drama anchored by two stellar lead performances from Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie. Canadian streamer Crave (the original studio behind Heated Rivalry) has already greenlit a second season, and if the show strikes your fancy, you should check out the books as well.

Despite its name, Rachell Sennot’s I Love LA is really a love letter to one’s late 20s — that magical time when you understand that life isn’t all sunshine and daisies, but you still have the energy to say “screw it” and go out partying with your friends. The show’s feelings about Los Angeles as a showbiz industry town are much thornier, and its sense of humor is charged with a deliciously pointed nihilism.

In its first season, The Pitt reminded everyone what makes tightly-crafted procedural dramas with hefty episode counts so satisfying to watch. Even though the show’s story took place over the course of a single day, The Pitt felt so much bigger because of how much time it spent developing its characters and making them feel like people with lives outside of the emergency room. Season 2 is right around the corner, but there’s still time to get all caught up. You should probably dig in soon, though, because The Pitt is a show best savored rather than binged.

Adventure Time: Fiona and Cake’s second season digs deeper into its whimsical multiverse as heroines Fionna (Madeleine Martin) and Cake the Cat (Roz Ryan) set out to save Finn the Human’s (Jeremy Shada) life after he’s wounded in battle. Though the second season moves a bit slower than the first, the way it deepens the backstories of some of Adventure Time’s supporting characters like Huntress Wizard (Ashly Burch) and Simon (Tom Kenny) is phenomenal.

There was so much detail from Stephen King’s It novel that didn’t make it into Warner Bros.’ recent film adaptations, and one of the (few) great things about HBO’s Welcome to Derry prequel series is how it manages to weave a lot of that lore into a wholly original story. There’s only so much mystery and suspense because this is a story about murderous horror from beyond the stars who we all know will live to see another day. But it’s interesting to see how Pennywise’s tactics have evolved over time, and if the finale’s any indication, we’re going to be seeing much more of the clown’s story unfolding in other points in time.

Harley (Kaley Cuoco) and Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) have had their ups and downs. But after a few seasons of figuring their romantic situation out, the couple are together, stronger than ever, and shaking their lives up a bit by leaving Gotham city behind in favor of moving to Metropolis. The Harley Quinn series has always excelled at lampooning the denizens of Batman’s home city, but the show’s fifth season takes things to the next level by taking aim at a bigger larger chunk of DC’s universe of heroes and villains.

Though Mad Men is almost 20-years-old at this point, it is new to HBO Max and the streamer has finally worked out most of those embarrassing technical issues that made the series’ 4K streaming debut such a fiasco. Mad Men’s approach to storytelling has always been excellent, but it’s especially wild in 2025 to see how the show’s characters evolve over the course of a seven season run. The series is an all-time classic that embodies everything that was great about the last pre-streaming golden age of TV. And if you haven’t had a chance to see Mad Men in its entirety, now is the perfect time to dive back in.

Mike White’s madcap dark comedy lampooning the wealthy travels to Thailand in its third season to weave another tale about people who can’t escape their inner demons. It takes a little bit longer for this season to really get rolling and deliver on The White Lotus’ promise of bonkers twists. But if you can stick it out, the season (mostly) delivers and makes for a solid watch before the show returns before its next chapter.

As was the case with The Last of Us Part II, the second season of HBO’s The Last of Us series goes through some major changes that takes its story in a very different direction. Bella Ramsey’s Ellie has always been a tremendous on-screen presence, but there’s a dynamism to her performance in season 2 that is nothing short of amazing. The show’s production design, cinematography, and special effects make it feel like one of HBO’s strongest projects in ages. And because we’re still a ways out from season 3 premiering, your best bet for now is to fire the show up from the very beginning.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6AZTfI54OUThe latest season of James Gunn’s Peacemaker snatched everyone’s wigs with a wild twist that makes a hell of a lot more sense when you watch the episodes for a second time. Multiversal superhero fare has long since grown a bit tiresome, but Peacemaker uses the comics convention to tell a surprisingly thoughtful and poignant story about its titular meathead. Though John Cena will likely reprise the role in future DC Studios projects, it seems like this might be the end of Peacemaker’s standalone series. But as superhero spinoff projects go, Peacemaker was a success that’s more than worth your time this holiday season.

Xiaomi used the Christmas period to launch its top flagship phone for the year, the 17 Ultra. It drops the extra rear display that’s the key selling point of the 17 Pro, but instead adds in the option of a manual zoom ring, built directly into the phone’s camera island.

That rotating zoom is only included in the new Leica edition of the phone, which also packs touches like the Leica red dot logo and a textured finish on the phone’s sides. The ring can be reprogrammed for exposure or focus if you prefer, and the Leica version has a few custom software touches too, like unique film simulation effects, and physical accessories like a lens cap and branded cleaning cloth.

Otherwise, the 17 Ultra by Leica is identical to the regular 17 Ultra. It’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, with up to 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. The OLED display is big, at 6.9 inches, and so is the silicon-carbon battery, at 6,800mAh.

Like all Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, its cameras are the real focus. The 50-megapixel main camera uses a 1-inch-type sensor and a wide f/1.7 aperture, with selfie and ultrawide cameras at the same resolution.

The bigger change is to the telephoto — instead of the two separate zoom lenses on the 15 Ultra, the new phone has a single 200-megapixel periscope camera that can range from 3.2x to 4.3x zoom. More impressively, it has continuous optical zoom throughout, a trick first employed in phones by the Sony Xperia 1 IV, with a variable aperture of f/2.4-3.0.

The 17 Ultra starts at ¥6,999 (about $1,000), with the Leica model at ¥7,999 (about $1,140). Xiaomi has confirmed plans for a global launch of the 17 Ultra in 2026, but we don’t know when exactly — or whether the Leica edition will be included. The Xiaomi 15 and 15 Ultra got an international rollout at MWC 2025 in March, so a repeat may be possible in the coming months.

            <div id="article-text">﻿2026 will bring new chips and further software improvements. But competition is heating up too.

﻿2026 will bring new chips and further software improvements. But competition is heating up too.

In 2024, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips finally made Arm-based Windows laptops viable. Unlike previous Arm laptops that struggled to even run Windows well, this new class offered solid performance and the best battery life on Windows, and they impressed us in Microsoft’s own Surface Laptop and Surface Pro offerings. But inconsistent app compatibility remained the biggest hurdle to running Windows on Arm. (It forced me to use the watered-down Adobe Lightroom app instead of Lightroom Classic, and that’s a sin.) And playing games, one of Windows’ greatest strengths against the walled garden of Apple’s Macs, was basically a nonstarter.

Throughout 2025, a slow burn of software improvements have taken the situation from pretty good to much better. Some creative apps that were absent from Windows on Arm now have native versions or run with Prism emulation. Adobe Premiere Pro works natively. And I found that Lightroom Classic, compatible in emulation, works just fine for light edits, even on lower-end Snapdragon X Plus chips.

More games work too, thanks to emulator improvements supporting x86 Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) and AVX2. Qualcomm even has a designated Snapdragon Control Panel for delivering prompt graphics driver updates, just like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat, used by Fortnite and other games, now works on Windows on Arm. And the Xbox game launcher now supports local game installs on Arm instead of only offering cloud streaming.

At this point, I have no hesitation recommending a Windows on Arm laptop to friends and family as long as they don’t require specific software, like Ableton Live, that’s not yet compatible (and even Ableton is getting an Arm version in 2026). Or, if gaming is their highest priority and they’re better served by the Asus ROGs and Lenovo Legions of the world than a thin-and-light. In fact, I encouraged my sister to buy the 13-inch Surface Laptop while it was on sale for $550 during Black Friday. That’s such a good deal, and I’m confident it’ll be the quietest, most portable, most powerful, and longest-lasting laptop she’s owned yet.

Even if you’re not upgrading from a 10-year-old laptop, the first generation of Snapdragon X chips offer battery life and standby times that were once unheard of for Windows laptops, especially coming off of a few especially bad generations of Intel processors. However, Intel’s Lunar Lake and AMD’s Strix Point chips took some of the wind out of Qualcomm’s sails when they launched a few months after, with competitive performance and nearly as good battery life.

Intel and AMD showed that the x86 architecture still has fight left in it. And as hype builds for 2026’s face-off between Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2, Intel’s Panther Lake, and AMD’s rumored “Gorgon Point,” we could be in for an even fiercer battle than usual. It could get more heated if Nvidia enters the fray.

There are rumors and leaked benchmarks indicating Nvidia is working on a new Arm-based chip to debut in a not-yet-announced Alienware laptop — in addition to whatever it’s cooking up with Intel for x86. The combination of Nvidia and Alienware points to an Arm chip with a big focus on graphics, much like AMD’s excellent Strix Halo on the x86 side. The integrated GPUs we’ve seen so far on Snapdragon chips aren’t powerful enough to run modern games at high settings, and Arm chips don’t yet support discrete GPUs. An Arm chip with Nvidia graphics could be pretty compelling for gamers.

Windows on Arm had a good year. The gap between x86 and Arm Windows laptops is narrowing, and it’ll narrow further in 2026. Arm laptops are easier to recommend to more people, though x86 will still be the better choice for gaming for the foreseeable future.

2026 will bring fresh challenges: not just new Intel and AMD chips, but fiercer competition from Linux, which also had a very good year. As Microsoft transforms Windows into an “agentic OS,” stuffing it with more semifunctional AI bloat, it risks further pissing off users, who might find greener pastures elsewhere. Maybe the question in 2026 won’t be “Should you buy a Windows on Arm laptop?” but “Should you buy a Windows laptop at all?”

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <h2>AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/25/1130298/ai-wrapped-the-14-ai-terms-you-couldnt-avoid-in-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <h2>Four bright spots in climate news in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1130191/good-climate-news-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
