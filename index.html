            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-gamestop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six and a half years ago—after a failed corporate sale attempt, massive financial losses, and the departure/layoff of many key staff—I wrote about what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of meme stock mania that helped prop up the company’s finances a bit, I’ll admit the video game and Funko Pop retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.

GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop has abruptly shut down 400 stores across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, per SEC filings.

GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.

The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when more than half of Destiny 2’s game sales came via download rather than disc, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like PlayStation Plus, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are skipping physical releases altogether these days, while Nintendo is selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.

Just as Tower Records couldn’t continue to exist in a world where almost all music was being downloaded or streamed, a chain devoted to selling games on physical discs can’t sustain itself in a world where the vast majority of game spending is now online.

Seeing the writing on the wall, GameStop has made a number of attempts to rebrand around something other than selling (or re-selling) physical video games. Anyone else remember the chain’s abortive attempt to restructure around “high margin immersive experiential gaming content” like esports? How about the rollout of “GameStop Retro” locations that sell games and hardware dating back to the last century? Or the much-hyped NFT marketplace that GameStop quietly wound down in 2023?

The latest attempt at a GameStop corporate pivot seems to be toward collectible trading cards, via in-store partnerships with card-grading agencies and a “Power Pack” program combining digital and physical card sales in some novel ways. But a world where GameStop is the place to trade in a $30,000 Pokémon card isn’t at all the same as the one where millions of people traded in Madden 09 discs for a couple of bucks of GameStop store credit.

So even though GameStop has lasted longer than I expected, I’m still relatively confident in predicting that the end is coming for the retailer sooner rather than later. Who knows, though, maybe I’ll be writing another article like this in 2033, marveling at how a once-lumbering giant in the world of video game sales is somehow continuing to limp along.</div>

            <h2>UK probes X over Grok CSAM scandal; Elon Musk cries censorship</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/uk-investigating-x-after-grok-undressed-thousands-of-women-and-children/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is currently under investigation in the United Kingdom after failing to stop the platform’s chatbot, Grok, from generating thousands of sexualized images of women and children.

On Monday, UK media regulator Ofcom confirmed that X may have violated the UK’s Online Safety Act, which requires platforms to block illegal content. The proliferation of “undressed images of people” by X users may amount to intimate image abuse, pornography, and child sexual abuse material (CSAM), the regulator said. And X may also have neglected its duty to stop kids from seeing porn.

“Reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal non-consensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X have been deeply concerning,” an Ofcom spokesperson said. “Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that’s illegal in the UK, and we won’t hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there’s a risk of harm to children.”

X is cooperating with the probe, Ofcom said, noting that X met a “firm” deadline last week to explain what steps it’s taking to comply with the UK law. Ofcom declined Ars’ request to share more details about possible changes X has already made to either limit Grok in the UK or more broadly, since the investigation is “live.”

Grok has already been blocked in Indonesia and Malaysia, as the chatbot remains unchecked. The UK could be next to block Grok if X fails to comply with the Online Safety Act. Additionally, X could face fines of up to 10 percent of its global revenue.

It’s unclear how long the probe will take to conclude. Ofcom’s spokesperson told Ars that the agency will progress the investigation “as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process.” The probe will end “as soon as reasonably possible.”

X will have an opportunity to respond to Ofcom’s preliminary ruling before any final decision is made.

Ars could not reach X to comment on the probe, but Musk has complained that Grok critics are looking for an “excuse for censorship,” the BBC reported. X has previously said that it will report harmful outputs to law enforcement and permanently suspend accounts that are abusing Grok to nudify images that X deems to be illegal content. The platform also started charging some users to edit images, instead of blocking outputs.

Shortly after Ofcom announced the probe, UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the country would be bringing a new law into force that makes it illegal for companies to supply tools designed to create sexualized images, the BBC reported.

Before Kendall’s announcement, it seemed like X could possibly escape the investigation unscathed, due to “gaps” in the Online Safety Act, according to the chairwomen of the UK Parliament’s technology and media committees, the BBC reported.

“There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality—that means generative AI’s ability to nudify someone’s image,” Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media, and sport committee, told the BBC.

Chairwomen suggested that the UK may need to update the law to better explain platforms’ duties to remove or prevent the making and sharing of sexualized deepfakes. In a document defining illegal content, however, Ofcom emphasizes that deepfakes can count as both CSAM and intimate image abuse, suggesting X could face penalties under the Online Safety Act for some of Grok’s outputs, even if Ofcom cannot require changes to Grok’s functionality.

Ofcom noted that in its view, CSAM does include “AI-generated imagery, deepfakes and other manipulated media,” which “would fall under the category of a ‘pseudo-photograph.’” As Ofcom explained, “If the impression conveyed by a pseudo-photograph is that the person shown is a child, then the photo should be treated as showing a child.”

Similarly, “manipulated images and videos such as deepfakes should be considered within the scope” of intimate image abuse, Ofcom said. “Any photograph or video which appears to depict an intimate situation” that a real person would not want publicly posted should “be treated as a photograph or video actually depicting such a situation.”

Some Grok fans think that the chatbot’s outputs that undress people and put them in skimpy bikinis or underwear isn’t abuse. However, the UK law further details that an “intimate situation” could be an image where a person’s “genitals, buttocks, or breasts” are “covered only with underwear” or “covered only by clothing that is wet or otherwise transparent.”

It’s unclear how long Ofcom may take to reach its decision, but the regulator acted urgently to intervene. And UK officials who were shocked by the scandal have confirmed that they are quickly moving to protect people in the UK from being targeted by Grok’s worst outputs.

While Ofcom does not directly refer to Musk’s comments on censorship, the regulator takes a defensive stance in its announcement—likely preparing to fight X’s argument by pointing out that X would be the one in charge of deciding what is illegal content and what should be removed.

“The legal responsibility is on platforms to decide whether content breaks UK laws, and they can use our Illegal Content Judgements Guidance when making these decisions,” Ofcom noted. “Ofcom is not a censor—we do not tell platforms which specific posts or accounts to take down.”</div>

            <h2>The Chevrolet Bolt is back... but for how long?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/the-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-for-how-long/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new Chevrolet Equinox EV is a solid entry into the compact crossover market, and with a (just) sub-$35,000 starting price, it also counts as affordable by the standards of 2026. But if you think that’s too rich for your blood, or that the Equinox is still too large for your needs, take heart—the Chevrolet Bolt is back in dealerships now as well.

The Bolt was GM’s first modern electric vehicle, following on from the hand-built, pre-lithium ion EV1 and the compliance car that was the Spark EV. We’re big fans of the Bolt here at Ars Technica. It offered well more than 200 miles of range in a mass-produced EV at a reasonable price well before Tesla’s Model 3 started clogging up our roads, it got more efficient over time, and it managed to be fun to drive in the process.

General Motors (which owns Chevrolet) probably feels less well-disposed toward the Bolt. It lost thousands of dollars on each car it sold, even before the entire fleet had to be recalled for a costly battery replacement. The issue was due to improperly folded tabs on some cells that could cause a battery fire, giving GM (and its battery partner LG) plenty of bad press in the process. That recall alone cost $1.8 billion.

The Bolt also predated GM’s big investment into the battery platform it used to but no longer calls “Ultium.” As the automaker began to ready a larger portfolio of new EVs (including the aforementioned Equinox EV), it decided the Bolt would have to go to make room for production of other, more profitable vehicles. The announcement was made in April 2023 and helped make the Bolt GM’s bestselling EV by a large margin.

The outcry from Bolt fans was loud and vociferous, and in July 2025, GM CEO Mary Barra announced that it would be coming back, with a new Ultium-based battery pack. But only in the Bolt EUV body style—if you prefer the original hatchback, you’re out of luck.

Reengineering the Bolt for a new battery pack wasn’t a quick process. The cells, modules, and electronics are all different but had to fit in the same size space with the same mounting points as the original. And GM’s own LFP factory won’t be producing cells until sometime next year. Which means for now, GM is importing LPF cells from CATL in China, paying costly tariffs in the process.

In October, Chevy released pricing: $28,995 (plus a $1,395 delivery charge) for the Bolt LT, or $32,995 for the Bolt RS. In time—we’re not sure when—there’s supposed to be a stripped-out model that starts at less than $28,000. For the record, this is more expensive than the Bolt EUV we reviewed in late 2022, particularly once you take trim levels into account. And of course, there’s now no way to cast your Apple or Android phone to the new infotainment system. And the model-year 2027 Bolt makes far less torque than the Bolts we were used to driving, which may well mean a very different on-road experience, given how important that tidal wave of torque is to how an EV feels.

Now, Chevy has released the all-important info: 262 miles (422 km) of range according to the EPA test, a slight improvement on the 249 miles (398 km) of range from the old Bolt EUV. Better news is that fast charging is almost three times more powerful. Where the old Bolt topped out at 55 kW, often infuriating other EV drivers waiting for them to hurry up at overcrowded charging stations, the new car will reach rates of up to 150 kW, meaning a 10–80 percent charge should take as little as 26 minutes, not close to an hour.

Chevy says that the new Bolt is already in dealerships, in both LT and RS trims. But its inventory checker won’t search for MY27 vehicles yet, so we haven’t been able to confirm that. The company has also said that the car is only back “for a limited time only.” Although with no elaboration on what “limited” means in this context, we can’t tell you how many cars the automaker will actually build.</div>

            <h2>New research shows how shunning ultraprocessed foods helps with aging</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/avoiding-ultraprocessed-foods-supports-healthier-aging/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Older adults can dramatically reduce the amount of ultraprocessed foods they eat while keeping a familiar, balanced diet—and this shift leads to improvements across several key markers related to how the body regulates appetite and metabolism. That’s the main finding of a new study my colleagues and I published in the journal Clinical Nutrition.

Ultraprocessed foods are made using industrial techniques and ingredients that aren’t typically used in home cooking. They often contain additives such as emulsifiers, flavorings, colors, and preservatives. Common examples include packaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, and some processed meats. Studies have linked diets high in ultraprocessed foods to poorer health outcomes.

My team and I enrolled Americans ages 65 and older in our study, many of whom were overweight or had metabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance or high cholesterol. Participants followed two diets low in ultraprocessed foods for eight weeks each. One included lean red meat (pork); the other was vegetarian with milk and eggs. For two weeks in between, participants returned to their usual diets.

A total of 43 people began the dietary intervention, and 36 completed the full study.

In both diets, ultraprocessed foods made up less than 15 percent of the total calories—a significant reduction from the typical American diet, where more than 50 percent of total calories comes from ultraprocessed foods. The diets were designed to be realistic for everyday eating, and participants were not instructed to restrict calories, lose weight, or change their physical activity.

We prepared, portioned, and provided all meals and snacks for the study. Both diets emphasized minimally processed ingredients and aligned with the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the US government’s nutrient-based recommendations for healthy eating, while providing similar calories and amounts of key nutrients.

The 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released on January 7, 2026, explicitly recommend eating less ultraprocessed food, but the previous versions of the guidelines did not specifically address food processing. Our feeding study design allowed us, for the first time, to examine the health effects of reducing ultraprocessed foods while keeping nutrient levels consistent with recommended targets.

We compared how participants fared while eating their habitual diets with how they responded to the two diets that were low in ultraprocessed foods. During the periods when participants ate fewer ultraprocessed foods, they naturally consumed fewer calories and lost weight, including total and abdominal body fat. Beyond weight loss, they also showed meaningful improvements in insulin sensitivity, healthier cholesterol levels, fewer signs of inflammation, and favorable changes in hormones that help regulate appetite and metabolism.

These improvements were similar whether participants followed the meat-based or the vegetarian diet.

Ultraprocessed foods make up more than half the calories consumed by most US adults. Although these foods are convenient and widely available, studies that track people’s diets over time increasingly link them with obesity and age-related chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. With older adults making up a growing share of the global population, strategies that preserve metabolic health could support healthy aging.

Most previous feeding studies testing how ultraprocessed foods affect people’s health haven’t reflected real-world eating, especially among Americans. For example, some studies have compared diets made up almost entirely of ultraprocessed foods with diets that contain little to none at all.

Our study aimed to more closely approximate people’s experience while still closely tracking the foods they consumed. It is the first to show that for older adults a realistic reduction in ultraprocessed foods, outside the lab, has measurable health benefits beyond just losing weight. For older adults especially, maintaining metabolic health helps preserve mobility, independence, and quality of life.

Our study was small, reflecting the complexity of studies in which researchers tightly control what participants eat. It was not designed to show whether the metabolic improvements we observed can prevent or delay diseases such as diabetes or heart disease over time. Larger, longer studies will be needed to answer that.

On the practical side, it’s still unclear whether people can cut back on ultraprocessed foods in their daily lives without structured support, and what strategies would make it easier to do so. It’s also not fully understood which aspects of processing—for example, additives, emulsifiers, or extrusion—matter more for health.

Answering these questions could help manufacturers produce foods that are healthier but still convenient—and make it easier for people to choose healthier food options.

The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age.

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10. Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs.

“This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, also known as Building 4572 (and 4573, its associated gantry) or the “T-tower” in reference to its shape, was the first stand to support the firing of single-stage rockets with multiple engines. During the 1960s, the 175-foot-tall (53-meter) facility contributed to the development of the F-1 engine and the first stage (S-IC) of the Saturn V, the rocket that launched the first astronauts to the moon.

The facility, which was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, was used to test the Redstone rocket, the first stage of the Saturn IB and, after being modified, the solid rocket motor used by the space shuttle program. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and listed as a National Landmark the next year.

In recent years, NASA considered using the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility to support the Constellation program and its Ares family of rockets, but that program was canceled in 2010.

“While it is hard to let them go, they’ve earned their retirement,” said Rae Ann Meyer, the acting director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. “Each one of these structures helped NASA make history.”

The Dynamic Test Stand (Building 4550) rises more than twice as high as the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility and for good reason—it was built to fit a fully assembled Saturn V (363 feet or 111 meters tall) for mechanical and vibrational trials. Described once as the tallest building in the state, the stand was later used to form the first complete space shuttle stack with a winged orbiter (the prototype “Enterprise”), external fuel tank, and solid rocket boosters.

The Dynamic Test Stand is so tall that, according to NASA, its last use in the early 2000s was as a drop tower in support of microgravity testing. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places and deemed a National Landmark in 1985.

“These structures are not safe,” said Meyer. “Strategic demolition is a necessary step in shaping the future of NASA’s mission to explore, innovate, and inspire. By removing these structures that we have not used in decades, we are saving money on upkeep of facilities we can’t use. We also are making these areas safe to use for future NASA exploration endeavors and investments.”

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility and the Dynamic Test Facility were among 19 sites identified for removal at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The count also includes the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS), a facility that enabled NASA astronauts and researchers to practice for spacewalks and work in microgravity. It comprised a tank that was 75 feet in diameter, 40 feet deep, and designed to hold up to nearly 1.5 million gallons of water (23 by 12 meters by 5.7 million liters).

The tests and training conducted in the NBS were pivotal to saving Skylab, the United States’ first space station, from damage it sustained during its 1973 launch. The simulator was also used to prepare for the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope during its first servicing mission in 1993.

The NBS opened in 1968 and was succeeded nearly 30 years later by a larger tank in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at the Sonny Carter Training Facility near NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Demolition of the NBS began in mid-December.

To preserve the legacy of the NBS, Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, and Dynamic Test Stand, detailed architectural summaries, written histories, and large-format photos were permanently archived in the Library of Congress’ Historic American Engineering Record collection. This ensures the information will be available to the public and researchers for years to come. Additionally, NASA partnered with Auburn University to create digital models of each site.

Physical artifacts from each site were also identified and transferred to the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, preserving tangible pieces for educational and inspirational purposes.

“As we look to an exciting future, we honor the past, especially the dedication of the men and women who built these structures and tested hardware that has launched into space, made unprecedented scientific discoveries, and inspired generations of Americans to reach for the stars,” said Meyer.</div>

            <h2>The most fascinating monitors at CES 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 took place in Las Vegas last week, and as usual, we’re looking at the most interesting monitors from the show. Not every display is a monitor in the strictest sense, but they all provide a display for computers and have a unique twist that make them worth exploring.

It was a pretty safe bet that Dell would announce new UltraSharp monitors at CES. The displays are a solid recommendation for reliable USB-C monitors, including for Mac users and people needing something polished for professional or creative work. In recent years, UltraSharp monitors have also boasted more modern features, including integrated web cameras and IPS Black tech.

This year, the strategy was clear: Bigger is better.

At 51.5 inches, the UltraSharp U5226KW that Dell announced at CES is the biggest UltraSharp monitor yet. It has a resolution of 6144×2560, for a pixel density of 129 pixels per inch. The IPS Black monitor also has a bevy of ports via a Thunderbolt 4 hub that supports up to 140 W power delivery. There’s a separate pop-out box with 27 W USB-C and 10 W USB-A ports, and the monitor can connect to up to four PCs simultaneously via an integrated KVM. There’s a bounty of connectivity options across this massive display.

The U5226KW lacks any other noteworthy innovations beyond its size, but Dell is still hoping to impress professionals who frequently use numerous apps simultaneously, and especially those currently using multi-monitor setups.

Dell’s giant UltraSharp launched last week for $2,900 with a stand or $2,800 without a stand.

All-in-ones (AIOs) are often overlooked, but Lenovo arrived at CES with a unique take on the computer-monitor combo.

The Lenovo ThinkCentre X AIO Aura Edition differs from other AIOs, including Apple’s 24-inch iMac, in its square-like panel. Its 16:18 aspect ratio means it’s not a true square, but the display is still much taller than other AIOs and most regular computer monitors, which are both usually 16:9.

The Aura Edition’s specs include a 27.6-inch IPS panel with 2560×2880 resolution, up to an Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processor, up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM, and two M.2 SSD storage slots.

Lenovo expects the PC to appeal to “creators, programmers, and data professionals who benefit from seeing two A4 pages or full data sets in an easy-to-view portrait display,” the company said in a press release.

Additionally, Lenovo will preload the system with business-friendly features, like Lenovo DeskView, which can “digitize documents placed in front of the screen for instant sharing.” And in case there’s any debate over whether the ThinkCentre X AIO is truly a monitor, Lenovo says the device will launch with Lenovo Share Zone, which lets the screen support both the AIO and a second, connected system simultaneously.

Noteworthy AIO releases are infrequent these days (Lenovo also announced a 32-inch 4K-resolution Yoga AIO I Aura Edition aimed at consumers who want their monitor’s base to light up in different colors depending on what’s on the screen. That machine is expected to release in Q2 for $2,400). Laptops, smartphones, and improvements in monitor technology and affordability have largely supplanted some of AIOs’ primary benefits, like saving space and providing an ample screen.

But with many companies pushing employees back into offices full-time or part-time, there’s an incentive to explore alternative ways to equip offices, from AIOs to big-screen tablets, and even keyboard-PCs. AIOs are easy for IT teams to set up and use minimal space. Simultaneously, Lenovo is offering an option for the growing number of people who prefer taller screens, perhaps due to the nature of their work or the increasing presence of taller displays in consumer laptops.

Lenovo didn’t announce a price or release date for its tall AIO.

A return to classic OLED subpixel layouts from panel-makers LG Display and Samsung Display is a promising sign for the versatility and legibility of future OLED monitors.

Most OLED computer monitors use either a WOLED panel from LG Display or a QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. WOLED panels feature a red, white, blue, and green (RWBG) subpixel layout or, for newer monitors, an RGWB subpixel layout. QD-OLED monitors have a triangular RGB layout.

Both subpixel layouts have issues with text legibility on Windows. That’s because ClearType, Windows’ subpixel font-rendering software, is built for LCDs with an RGB-stripe subpixel layout. The result for OLED monitors is “fringing,” which, to astute eyes, appears as a colorful border around text. Fringing is especially common on OLED monitors with less than 4K resolution and is often more associated with QD-OLED than WOLED.

As is common in emerging, expensive computing peripherals, OLED monitors first targeted gamers, making fringing less of a concern. WOLED and QD-OLED panels were also favored by panel suppliers because they were easier to manufacture in large sizes for TVs.

And after Japanese panel maker JOLED went bankrupt (it has since been acquired), we stopped seeing new RGB-stripe OLED monitors, which should be more suitable for reading, working, and other non-gaming applications.

But this year, LG Display is making OLED panels with RGB-stripe subpixels. As the company announced in December, “the RGB stripe structure arranges the three primary color subpixels—red, green, and blue—in a straight line, significantly reducing visual distortions such as color bleeding and fringing, even at close viewing distances. Although OLED panels using the RGB stripe method existed before, their maximum refresh rate reached around 60 Hz, making them unsuitable for use as gaming monitors.”

To enable an RGB-stripe subpixel and high refresh rates, LG Display said it increased “the proportion of the pixel area that emits light.”

Similarly, Samsung Display announced at CES that this year, Asus and MSI will release monitors with Samsung’s new QD-OLED panels, which use a vertical RGB subpixel structure the company has named “V-stripe.”

“The biggest technical challenges in mass-producing high refresh rate panels with a new pixel structure include reduced organic material lifespan, heat generation, and brightness degradation,” Samsung Display’s announcement said. “By leveraging QD-OLED’s top emission structure, which offers brightness advantages, along with improvements in organic material efficiency and design optimization, we were able to mass-produce a high-performance monitor.”

Some publications that demoed RGB-stripe OLED monitors at CES reported text looking noticeably better than on other OLED monitors.

LG and Gigabyte also announced that they will release OLED monitors with RGB-stripe subpixels this year.

In true CES fashion, Samsung’s latest Odyssey 3D monitor one-ups its predecessor in every way it can.

Samsung launched its first Odyssey 3D monitor last year. We found that while the glasses-free 3D experience was impressive, the monitor was hard to recommend given its limited game support.

Back then, Samsung’s Odyssey 3D Hub app, which is used to launch stereoscopic content, had 14 games. As of this writing, there are 29 3D-supporting titles (you can see a full list at the Microsoft Store), but that still may not be enough to warrant a purchase price of what we expect will be over $2,000, based on the preceding Odyssey 3D’s release price.

The lack of applications for a glasses-free 3D gaming monitor didn’t stop Samsung from releasing a larger option, though. The Odyssey 3D that came out in 2025 has a 27-inch 4K IPS screen with a 165 Hz refresh rate. The 2026 model is 32 inches and supports 6K resolution (6144×3456) at a refresh rate of 165 Hz. The monitor is also supposed to easily drop down to 3K resolution (3072×1728), at which point it will run at 330 Hz. So although you don’t need glasses to get the most out of this monitor, you will need a decently powerful GPU.

In addition to glasses-free 3D gaming, Samsung’s 3D monitors can make 2D videos appear to be in 3D. In our testing of the 27-inch Odyssey 3D, this worked well enough on YouTube videos, albeit with a bit of a cardboard-cutout effect.

Most gamers or people seeking 6K resolution won’t opt for a 3D monitor. But Samsung’s investment in improving 3D displays alongside (slowly) growing game support should be welcome for people who have been waiting 15 years for glasses-free 3D to really take off.

G-Sync Pulsar is a backlight strobing technique designed to reduce perceived blur when viewing fast-moving content on supported monitors.

The backlight on a Pulsar monitor pulses for one-fourth of a frame right before pixels are overwritten. This enables pixels to be the proper color before they’re lit up so you don’t see pixels fading from one hue to another. The approach differs from that of most monitors, which use always-on backlights, and is reminiscent of plasma TVs, which didn’t have backlights but lit up pixels in quick pulses, helping to reduce motion blur. Pulsar also differs from other forms of backlight strobing, such as Nvidia’s Ultra Low Motion Blur, in that it works with variable refresh rates.

Speed-hungry gamers have been awaiting Pulsar monitors since Nvidia announced the technology at CES 2024. As of this writing, three Pulsar monitors are available to purchase: Acer’s Predator XB273U F5, Asus’ ROG Strix Pulsar XG27AQNGV, and MSI’s MPG 272QRF X36.

Two-year-old California startup Odinn reportedly held limited demos at CES last week of Odinn’s Omnia X,  a provocative approach to the idea of a “portable data center.”

The term “data center” is a stretch, though, as Omnia X is far from matching the computing capabilities of even a modest data center. The PC can support up to two AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs, four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs, and 6TB of DDR5 memory.

That’s an impressive amount of power to fit in a chassis that Odinn claims is the size of carry-on luggage. The system also has a flip-down keyboard and a pair of handles, which are essential since Omnia X weighs 77 pounds. That’s more than what you’d expect from a&quot;portable” gadget, but Omnia X’s form factor is more about simplifying “data center” access for businesses and employees with demanding and sensitive computing needs who work in various locations.

In an interview with Las Vegas Sun, Oddin CEO Carl Liebel compared Omnix X to about half of a data center rack and said it could replace a company’s need to rent space in a data center.

The Omnia X makes this list due to its (optional) integrated, 23.8-inch 4K display that flips out from the system’s side. With the display and max specifications, the Omnia X could be the most well-equipped portable computing solution we’ve seen.

Odinn says that Omnia X uses a redundant power supply unit (PSU) with a high Platinum rating for efficiency. In a PSU, efficiency means less internal heat and lower energy consumption—key areas of concern in a system like Omnia’s. Interesting Engineering reported that Omnia X uses a proprietary closed-loop cooling system.

Odinn’s website targets Omnia X at heavy-lift projects, like “military AI missions,” “enterprise-grade simulations,” and portable data centers.

“Run large models without ever connecting to the cloud. Omnia AI was built for mission-critical inference at the edge, from battlefield computer vision to real-time autonomous navigation,” Omnia’s website reads. “With dual GPUs, massive RAM, and hardware-level isolation, it delivers the kind of raw AI horsepower previously reserved for large-scale data centers, right where your team needs it most.”

Odinn is also pitching the computer to cinematographers, 3D artists, and VFX editors who work on location. Analysts, investigators, and cyber operators could also benefit by using the system for “mapping threat surfaces, performing forensic investigations, or searching across massive, disconnected data sets,” the California startup claims.

Omnia X will cost at least $550,000 Liebel told Las Vegas Sun. You can see pictures of it at the show here and here.

Every year at CES, a new panel claims to be the fastest monitor that has ever existed. Sure, most people don’t need a monitor that can refresh 1,000 times per second. But extremely high refresh rates do offer visual benefits, including less blur and fast objects looking sharper. It’s also just cool to see how far professional-grade gaming monitors can go.

One of the fastest monitors at CES 2026 is Acer’s 1,000 Hz Predator XB273U F6. Last month, Philips and AOC announced upcoming monitors that could run 720p at 1,000 Hz, too. But Acer appears to be the closest to actually releasing such a monitor. The OEM gave demos of its 1,000 Hz, 27-inch display at last week’s trade show. Unlike the other monitors, Acer’s speedy screen has a launch timeframe: Q2 2026. (Samsung also announced a 1,040 Hz monitor at the show, but the additional 40 Hz seems negligible at this point, and Samsung hasn’t provided details about how it purportedly reached that speed. Further, there seemed to be minimal demos of Samsung’s 27-inch Odyssey G6 G60H at CES 2026.)

While 1,000 Hz monitors target gamers playing games at the highest levels, they are also built to support a 2560×1440 resolution at a slower—but still amazingly fast—500 Hz.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A dead star 730 light years away appears to be forming a powerful structure around itself — and despite their best efforts, astronomers aren’t sure how.

The cosmic corpse, designated RXJ0528+2838, is an incredibly dense stellar remnant known as a white dwarf, with a Sun-like star orbiting around it. This binary arrangement isn’t uncommon throughout the universe, but what is strange is the structure surrounding the former body: a highly energetic and luminescent cloud known as a nebula, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything that could be forming it.

“Our observations reveal a powerful outflow that, according to our current understanding, shouldn’t be there,” said Krystian Iłkiewicz, a researcher at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center in Warsaw, Poland, and co-lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, in a statement.

White dwarfs are what’s left over when stars of moderate mass like our Sun exhaust all their fuel, shed their outer layers, and expose a dense core.

In many cases of binary systems, the white dwarf starts stealing material from its stellar companion. As it does so, the stolen matter forms a luminous ring around itself known as an accretion disc. Then, as the star slowly revolves around the galactic center and moves through space, it creates a shock wave in the nebula called a bow shock, which is a “curved arc of material, similar to the wave that builds up in front of a ship,” explained coauthor Noel Castro Segura, a researcher at the University of Warwick in the UK, in the statement.

RXJ0528+2838 defies this common understanding, however, because it doesn’t show any sign of having an accretion disc. Moreover, the team’s images taken with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope also rules out that it was caused by a thermonuclear explosion called a nova that commonly occurs when enough stolen material accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface and explodes. Adding to the incredible nature, the size of the bow shock suggests that the white dwarf has been producing an outflow for at least 1,000 years, which seems improbable for a dead star.

“The surprise that a supposedly quiet, discless system could drive such a spectacular nebula was one of those rare ‘wow’ moments,”  said co-lead author Simone Scaringi, an associate professor at Durham University in the UK, in the statement.

Everything points to the star siphoning material from its stellar companion but without forming a disc around itself. The researchers’ best guess is that this has something to do with the white dwarf’s powerful magnetic field somehow powering the outflows.

“Our finding shows that even without a disc, these systems can drive powerful outflows, revealing a mechanism we do not yet understand,” Iłkiewicz said. “This discovery challenges the standard picture of how matter moves and interacts in these extreme binary systems.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite an economy that’s booming on paper, economists are warning that the middle class is being squeezed as new jobs aren’t materializing fast enough to make up for the ones we’re losing.

It’s a grim economic outlook for those who are already struggling to make ends meet. At the same time, sports betting is taking off, with experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction. And online “prediction market” platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are taking things even further, allowing practically anybody to bet their hard-earned cash on dubious predictions, like whether the US will invade Venezuela — without any meaningful regulatory oversight to protect them from scams, insider trading, and financial ruin.

Even cable television is embracing the worrying trend. Case in point, CBS‘ 83rd Golden Globes award show showed a live ticker of Polymarket predictions for various awards during its Sunday evening broadcast of the event — actively encouraging viewers to gamble on the platform.

Some predictions turned out totally wrong, with “Sinners” taking a clear front lead on Polymarket for Best Drama, only for “Hamnet” to take the prize. Others triumphed, with the majority of users correctly betting on Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Director for “One Battle After Another.”

Bets for the evening closed up at 7 am Sunday morning on Polymarket, which means live viewers were unable to get in on the fun. Nonetheless, onlookers were appalled at the pointed inclusion, turning the storied awards show into a glorified gambling ad. Many pointed out that the Golden Globes had already struggled with viewership in recent years, amidst a series of scandals involving corruption, racism, and even sexual assault.

In other words, encouraging crypto-based gambling was the cherry on top.

“‘The Golden Globes Best Podcast odds presented by Polymarket’ is a new low for this humiliating awards show,” tweeted Semafor senior social media editor Josh Billinson.

“The Golden Globes incorporating Polymarket betting ON SCREEN is genuinely disgusting, and we need to push back on these pocket casinos at every opportunity,” online celebrity Matt Bernstein wrote.

“We’re so deep into capitalism that the Golden Globes are showing [P]olymarket betting odds on award winners… we’re so cooked,” another user.

The Golden Globes’ owner, Penske Media Corp., announced the eyebrow-raising pairing-up between the Donald Trump Jr.-funded prediction platform and the Larry Ellison-run broadcaster last week.

“Our partnership with Polymarket unlocks a groundbreaking new frontier, redefining how audiences engage with and connect to the content they love,” said president Craig Perreault in a statement. “Deepening the connection between fans and their favorite films, shows, and actors strengthens the entertainment industry and highlights the award-winning content celebrated at the Golden Globes.”

Penske-owned publications, including Variety,Deadline, and The Hollywood Reporter, breathlessly promoted the partnership, as The Wrap reports, suggesting a troubling degree of editorial influence.

The timing of the partnership couldn’t have been worse. The news comes just days after Polymarket became embroiled in a major insider trading scandal after a mystery trader made more than $400,000 by making incredibly well-timed bets on the United States’ attacks on Venezuela — just hours before the US invaded the South American country.

In a certain sense, the Golden Globes flap is fitting; the awards show has long garnered a reputation for being pay-to-play, giving preferential treatment to those willing to line Penske’s pockets.

To many, directly encouraging users to bet on awards during an awards ceremony is not just irritating; it’s a sign of the times we live in, as gambling becomes a mainstay part of Americans’ everyday lives.

“This is like watching a car crash in real time,” one user lamented.

“Polymarket odds on the telecast of the Golden Globes,” another wrote. “Just push me in front of a bus at this point.”

Others poked fun at Penske achieving a new low.

“Heartfelt congratulations to Penske Media for achieving its highest state of being,” author Mark Harris wrote mockingly on Bluesky.

            <div id="article-text">Cosmetic surgeons have turned to using a “fat filler” harvested from dead people in order to give patients new breasts, sexier buttocks and other body contouring tweaks, according to reporting by Business Insider — in a practice that not even “Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley could have dreamed up in her day.

The hot new product in question is called alloClae, manufactured by biomedical science business Tiger Aesthetics, and it’s become increasingly popular in plastic surgery circles despite its gruesome origins and aggressive price tag — ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per procedure, according to BI — because it allows dramatically less healing time and doesn’t require patients being put under general anesthesia.

“People are paying for the convenience,” New York City plastic surgeon Sachin Shridharani told the site.

Historically, plastic surgeons have relied on implants or siphoning fat from another section of your body and injecting it into another part in order to perform body contouring. Using alloClae gives them a flexible new option.

Another reason why it’s become popular is that weight loss GLP-1 agonists drugs like Ozempic have made faces and bodies saggy — and that has them clamoring for specialists like Shridharani to fix their body issues.

“In their own words, ‘I’ve got no ass,&#39;” Shridharani said. “‘My trousers look like they’re falling off.&#39;”

So how does somebody’s fat end up in a plastic surgeon’s syringe?

What typically happens is that people donate their bodies to science, with organs going to donation or scientific research. Tissue banks also harvest fat calls from dead people’s abdomen’s, though, and Tiger Aesthetics buys it and processes the fat cells into alloClae.

“As of the beginning of 2026, we’ll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that’s out there,” Tiger Aesthetics preident Caroline Van Hove told BI.

The practice isn’t entirely unprecedented. There’s already a product called Renuva, for instance, with the same origin but used for facial injections.

Is it weird to have your body sculpted with the fat from a dead person? Maybe, but you clearly can’t argue with results — or the horror of body issues.

            <h2>Red Hot Christmas Toy Crashes So Badly That Kids Can’t Actually Use It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/christmas-toy-crash-phone">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Parents were left scrambling on Christmas day after the hot toy of the season appeared to crash and burn, in a perfect cautionary tale about the era of connected gadgets that can easily brick if their delicate infrastructure is put under strain.

The toy, called the Tin Can, is basically a stripped down landline phone that places calls over WiFi. The devices are styled after colorful tin cans — like an old school tin can telephone, an archaic toy so thoroughly ancient that kids today presumably have no idea it ever existed — with twirly cords just like the landlines of yore.

The pitch is that the Tin Can allows parents to set up a sort of closed network of other Tin Can users, making it a nice compromise for kids who are too young for a cell phone, but who still want to communicate with their friends and family members. It’s free to call other Tin Can users, or parents can pay a $10 monthly subscription to make outside calls.

Yet when kids rushed to phone their friends over the holidays to schedule playdates and sledding runs, they found the string had been cut.

“Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people’s abilities to set up their devices or make calls,” Tin Can’s founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider in an interview. “Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn’t get it all right.”

“It worked great, the kids were using it,” Maria Pahuja, a parent from Virginia, told the publication. “Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working. Sometimes you’d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn’t.”

In other words, kids probably would have had a better chance of connecting with their friends with an actual tin can telephone, operated via vibrationson a string, on Christmas morn’.

By now, things seem to be back up and running, though there are still some issues with call quality popping up, BI reports. A January 8th status update on the company’s website — and, tellingly, a banner on the very top of its home page — advises parents that “we’re continuing to see very positive signs of recovery, but we’re still working through some lingering issues.” The company began in Seattle “with a handful of families and has since grown to serve families across more than 30 states,” its site says. BI reports the company has successfully raised $15.5 million since its launch in Autumn of 2024 — resources which apparently weren’t enough to prevent the toys from turning into a corded lump of coal at the exact moment they were supposed to make a great first impression.

            <h2>Researchers Just Discovered Something Startling About How Conservatives Pick Political Positions</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been watching the intense partisan divide over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minnesota this week, it’s likely felt as though different Americans are living in completely separate realities.

As it turns out, neuroscience might be able to explain why. In a new study whose findings will surprise absolutely no one who’s endured a fiery holiday dinner debate, researchers discovered that conservative and liberal brains don’t just arrive at fundamentally different conclusions, but take strikingly different paths to get there. It’s a fascinating piece of research which just might explain something about the yawning political divides currently tearing society apart.

The study, published in the journal PLOS One, explored why people rely on different types of evidence when explaining why things happen. Specifically, the paper’s authors at the University of Idaho sought to find why some people look for tons of high-level statistical information, while others are happy to listen to anecdotes or single authority figures to reach political conclusions.

In order to carry out the study, researchers recruited 583 adults from the US, who each took a political ideology survey as well as a test to measure their level of “cognitive reflection,” which measures the capacity to look past a knee-jerk response and engage in factual analysis.

Each participant was then given a fictional scenario about cash bail, a “pay-to-leave-jail” policy which critics say unjustly punishes the poor.

The participants were told that, out of the top 300 US cities by population, 100 had ended cash bail. They were then asked to evaluate whether the policy was “effective at reducing crime” based on 10 pieces of evidence. Each piece of information was either composed of statistical figures or testimony from political “experts” from groups like the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and the National Rifle Association, in order to measure which type of evidence each one gravitated toward.

Participants had the chance to go through as many bits of evidence as they wanted before they delivered their final analysis to the researchers — though not all took advantage of this. For example, the researchers found that the probability a participant would rely on a single data point for their conclusion rose from about 4 percent for “very liberal” people to over 37 percent for “very conservative” folks.

As the researchers concluded, those on the left “tend to be more likely to consult a comprehensive set of statistical data relative to those on the right.”

Outside of the left-right paradigm, those who scored high on the cognitive reflection test were more likely to compare and contrast all available statistical data to form their conclusions than those who scored lower.

“Importantly, our study shows that two major individual-level variables help to predict what type of ‘evidence seeker’ a given person is: whether or not they are ‘cognitively reflected’ and whether or not they are liberal/conservative,” the study’s lead author and professor of politics and philosophy at the University of Idaho Florian Justwan told PsyPost.

“Indeed, people’s political beliefs influence how they look for information (often without them realizing it),” Justwan continued.

Zooming out, the research adds to a body of work which suggests that left-leaning people have more trust in the scientific method than conservatives. While that isn’t exactly a bombshell revelation, it does paint an interesting picture of how people one both sides of the aisle come to their political conclusions.

Said another way: while the research surely won’t end the culture war bickering at Thanksgiving, it gives us a strong explanation why one person’s “obvious proof” is another person’s fake news — a fundamental rift which, if ever resolved, could completely change the political landscape.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly a week after US strikes bombarded Venezuela during the kidnapping of its president Nicolás Maduro, betting platform Polymarket is refusing to pay out users who gambled on the invasion of Venezeula.

Polymarket is a controversial prediction market where users can gamble on the outcome of real-world events, like who will win a certain election, or which side will control a certain village in the Ukraine-Russo war by a pre-specified date.

In this particular wager, Polymarket was supposed to pay out if “the United States commences a military offensive intended to establish control over any portion of Venezuela,” a determination to be made by “a consensus of credible sources,” the New York Times reported. To those who wagered on such an outcome, the events of January 3rd were proof positive that an invasion had taken place.

Instead, Polymarket came out with a statement arguing the opposite.

“This market refers to US military operations intended to establish control,” the note declares. “President Trump’s statement that they will ‘run’ Venezuela while referencing ongoing talks with the Venezuelan government does not alone qualify the snatch-and-extract mission to capture Maduro as an invasion.”

Those looking to cash in on the brutal attacks — which have killed at least 100 people so far — weren’t too impressed with the platform’s semantical wit.

“Pretty sure this should be yes after Trump said approximately 20 times in his press conference that the US now controls Venezuela,” groused a bettor with $1,876 wagered on a US invasion of Venezuela by March 31st. “We are going to run the country,” another user exclaimed.

“They think there will be no punishment for all this fraud. They are openly changing the rules and manipulating the market,” one user who bet $123 on the outcome complained. “A major investigation file is being prepared regarding Polymarket by the US Department of Justice. Don’t worry.”

Betting market participants relitigating results they don’t like is quickly becoming a pattern in the sector, with similar debates playing out over Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” pick and Elon Musk’s overly ambitious promises about Tesla’s self-driving taxi program.

Still, the latest incident heaps drama on Venezuela’s role in betting markets; it comes amidst some pretty compelling allegations that an insider with advanced knowledge of the US attack on Venezuela scored over $400,000 betting similar lines. (The alleged insider’s bets won all their bets.)

In this case however, every bettor who thought they were crowdsourcing the truth instead got a time honored lesson: no matter what you’re betting over, the house always wins.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Automated investment platform Betterment has confirmed that hackers broke into some of its systems last week and accessed the personal information of an undisclosed number of its customers.

In an email sent on Monday, which TechCrunch has seen, Betterment said that hackers gained access to some company systems on January 9 by way of a social engineering attack, which involved “third-party platforms” that the company uses for marketing and operations.

The company said customer names, email addresses and postal addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth were compromised in the attack.

With this access, hackers were able to send a fraudulent notification to users, claiming to triple the value of their crypto by sending $10,000 to a wallet controlled by the attacker, as reported by The Verge.

Betterment, which allows customers to invest in crypto, also published an announcement about the breach on its website, but did not disclose how many customers were targeted, nor how many had their personal information accessed, stolen, or seen by the hackers.

Betterment added that it detected the attack on the same day and “immediately revoked the unauthorized access and launched a comprehensive investigation, which is ongoing,” with the help of an unspecified cybersecurity firm. Betterment also said it has reached out to the customers targeted by the hackers and “advised them to disregard the message.”

“Our ongoing investigation has continued to demonstrate that no customer accounts were accessed and that no passwords or other log-in credentials were compromised,” Betterment wrote in the email.

Representatives for Betterment did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details about the attack.

As of the time of publication, Betterment’s security incident web page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to ignore the page, making it more difficult for anyone searching the web to discover information about the data breach.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/developers-have-made-550-billion-on-apples-app-store-since-2008/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple services had a “record-breaking year,” according to a blog post by senior vice president Eddy Cue.

In 2025, Apple had 850 million average weekly App Store users (up from 813 million in 2024), over $100 billion in Apple Pay merchant sales, and a 36% increase in monthly Apple TV engagement.

Apple Music also had its best year ever for listenership and new subscriber growth, which is impressive amid Spotify’s longstanding dominance of the market.

Apple has less frequently disclosed figures about App Store payouts over the last several years, but the company shared that it has now paid $550 billion to developers since its launch in 2008. This indicates significant growth, as Apple last reported that as of 2021, it had paid out $260 billion to developers, up from the $200 billion it reported in 2020.

The App Store generally takes a 30% commission from in-app purchases, though it offers small businesses (developers making under $1 million annually) a reduced 15% fee. This section of Apple’s business has been the target of heavy regulatory scrutiny, with international courts investigating it for monopolistic practices.

Apple’s entertainment products are making strides, too. Apple TV eclipsed all prior viewership records in December 2025, the company says, and Apple Music achieved record highs in listenership and new subscribers.

Apple TV’s growth comes alongside the debut of new hits like “Pluribus” and “The Studio,” as well as ongoing successes like “Severance.” Apple TV also struck major streaming deals with Major League Soccer and Formula 1. “F1,” Apple TV’s movie about the sport, became Apple Studios’ highest-grossing film yet, as well as the highest-grossing film of star Brad Pitt’s career.

Apple credits its karaoke-like “Sing” feature, partnerships with companies like GM and Chase, and other new developments for its growth. It notes that Shazam generated over 1 billion recognitions per month, which could have funneled growth into its Music service.

But it’s also possible that Apple benefited from controversy around Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s business ventures.

Ek’s investment firm led a €600 million investment in European defense tech company Helsing, which makes AI-powered military software and strike drones. Artists like Xiu Xiu, Sylvan Esso, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof, and others removed their catalogs from Spotify in protest.

Spotify has faced other controversies over the last several years, from its platforming of COVID-19 misinformation via Joe Rogan’s podcast (formerly a Spotify exclusive) to its artist payout metrics.

On the other hand, Apple Music could be growing because it’s simply making a product that is better suited for some listeners (I wrote about my decision to switch from Spotify to Apple Music as I became increasingly suffocated by algorithmic recommendations).

It could also be a financial decision amid uncertain economic times — Apple Music lures new subscribers with its three-month free offer, which comes alongside the purchase of most new Apple devices.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s official. Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri.

“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement.

The partnership confirms previous reporting on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around$1 billion for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitorslike OpenAI and Anthropic.

The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software.

The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of public chatter criticizing it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of Apple Intelligence in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google.

The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, occasionally resented form of AI – one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for.

Apple has delayed the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring.

Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default on its devices and web browsers. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple about $38 billion to secure default search placements.

In December 2025, Judge Amit Mehta issued his final remedies on the case, which include banning Google from entering into exclusive, default agreements like the one it had with Apple “unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As two major streaming platforms—Warner Bros. and Netflix—prepare for a merger, concerns continue to be voiced about the implications of the deal, which represents more consolidation in the media business.

On Monday, Paramount CEO David Ellison announced that the company has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) in Delaware, demanding greater financial disclosure regarding Netflix’s $82.7 billion acquisition.

In a letter to shareholders, Ellison disclosed that the lawsuit has been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, requesting that WBD provide essential information that it allegedly has failed to share. Ellison argues that shareholders need accurate information to assess whether to accept Paramount’s competing offer of $30 per share in cash, which he claims is superior to Netflix’s deal.

Ellison wrote, “WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.”

“Along with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation…WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’ of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer,” Ellison added.

Last week, WBD’s board rejected Paramount’s latest bid once again, saying there’s too much risk of the deal falling through.

President Trump also expressed his dissatisfaction with the merger. Over the weekend, Trump shared on Truth Social an opinion piece by John Pierce titled “Stop the Netflix Cultural Takeover,” published in One America News last month. Pierce believes if Netflix acquires Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, it would establish itself as “the most dominant cultural gatekeeper the United States—and much of the world—has ever seen.”

After meeting with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in December, Trump indicated that the merger “could be a problem,” due to Netflix’s already significant market share, which would expand greatly with the acquisition.

The industry has also generally reacted negatively to the acquisition, raising concerns about job implications, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV.

Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Sarandos attempted to address these fears in a letter last month. However, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) continues to oppose the acquisition, citing antitrust law violations. Lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal, warn that the merger could lead to increased consumer costs, exacerbating financial pressures on middle-class families, especially following Netflix’s recent price hike.

            <h2>A New Jersey lawsuit shows how hard it is to fight deepfake porn</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For more than two years, an app called ClothOff has been terrorizing young women online — and it’s been maddeningly difficult to stop. The app has been taken down from the two major app stores and it’s banned from most social platforms, but it’s still available on the web and through a Telegram bot. In October, a clinic at Yale Law School filed a lawsuit that would take down the app entirely, forcing the owners to delete all images and cease operation entirely. But simply finding the defendants has been a challenge.

“It’s incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,” explains Professor John Langford, a co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, “but we believe it’s run by a brother and sister and Belarus. It may even be part of a larger network around the world.”

It’s a bitter lesson in the wake of the recent flood of non-consensual pornography generated by Elon Musk’s xAI, which included many underage victims. Child sexual abuse material is the most legally toxic content on the internet — illegal to produce, transmit or store, and regularly scanned for on every major cloud service. But despite the intense legal prohibitions, there are still few ways to deal with image generators like ClothOff, as Langford’s case demonstrates. Individual users can be prosecuted, but platforms like ClothOff and Grok are far more difficult to police, leaving few options for victims hoping to find justice in court.

The clinic’s complaint, which is available online, paints an alarming picture. The plaintiff is an anonymous high school student in New Jersey, whose classmates used ClothOff to alter her Instagram photos. She was 14 years old when the original Instagram photos were taken, which means the AI-modified versions are legally classified as child abuse imagery. But even though the modified images are straightforwardly illegal, local authorities declined to prosecute the case, citing the difficulty of obtaining evidence from suspects’ devices.

“Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed,” the complaint reads.

Still, the court case has moved slowly. The complaint was filed in October, and in the months since, Langford and his colleagues have been in the process of serving notice to the defendants — a difficult task given the global nature of the enterprise. Once they’ve been served, the clinic can push for a court appearance and, eventually, a judgment, but in the meantime the legal system has given little comfort to ClothOff’s victims.

The Grok case might seem like a simpler problem to fix. Elon Musk’s xAI isn’t hiding, and there’s plenty of money at the end for lawyers who can win a claim. But Grok is a general purpose tool, which makes it much harder to hold it accountable in court.

“ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography image and video generator,” Langford told me. “When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets a lot more complicated.”

A number of US laws have already banned deepfake pornography — most notably the Take It Down Act. But while specific users are clearly breaking those laws, it’s much harder to hold the entire platform accountable. Existing laws require clear evidence of an intent to harm, which would mean providing evidence xAI knew their tool would be used to produce non-consensual pornography. Without that evidence, xAI’s basic first amendment rights would provide significant legal protection..

“In terms of the First Amendment, it’s quite clear Child Sexual Abuse material is not protected expression,” Langford says. “So when you’re designing a system to create that kind of content, you’re clearly operating outside of what’s protected by the First Amendment. But when you’re a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it’s not so clear.”

The easiest way to surmount those problems would be to show that xAI had willfully ignored the problem. It’s a real possibility, given recent reporting that Musk directed employees to loosen Grok’s safeguards. But even then, it would be a far riskier case to take on.

“Reasonable people can say, we knew this was a problem years ago,” Langford says. “How can you not have had more stringent controls in place to make sure this doesn’t happen? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge but it’s just a more complicated case.”

Those First Amendment issues are why xAI’s biggest pushback has come from court systems without robust legal protections for free speech. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have taken steps to block access to the Grok chatbot, while regulators in the United Kingdom have opened an investigation that could lead to a similar ban. Other preliminary steps have been taken by the European Commission, France, Ireland, India and Brazil. In contrast, no US regulatory agency has issued an official response.

It’s impossible to say how the investigations will resolve, but at the very least, the flood of imagery raises lots of questions for regulators to investigate — and the answers could be damning.

“If you are posting, distributing, disseminating Child Sexual Abuse material, you are violating criminal prohibitions and can be held accountable,” Langford says. “The hard question is, what did X know? What did X do or not do? What are they doing now in response to it?“

            <div id="article-text">The 83rd Golden Globes was a standout evening for streaming platforms. Netflix led the pack with seven wins, while Apple TV and HBO Max each secured three awards, and Hulu took home one.​

Among Netflix’s highlights, the hit series “Adolescence” claimed four awards, including best limited series. The show also earned awards for best actor (Stephen Graham), supporting actor (Owen Cooper), and supporting actress (Erin Doherty) in a miniseries. Netflix’s most-watched title, “KPop Demon Hunters,” won best animated feature and best original song.​

Netflix’s Golden Globes sweep comes just as the company prepares for the biggest moves in Hollywood: the acquisition of Warner Bros.

​As for the other streamers, Apple TV earned two awards for “The Studio,” one for best television series (musical or comedy) and another for best actor in a TV series, awarded to Seth Rogen. Rhea Seehorn also secured the best lead actress in a television drama for her performance in “Pluribus.”

HBO found success with its medical drama “The Pitt,” which picked up two Golden Globes, including one for actor Noah Wylie. HBO’s third award was for best female actor in a TV series – musical or comedy (Jean Smart, “Hacks”).

​Hulu’s lone win came from Michelle Williams, who earned best lead actress for “Dying for Sex.” However, titles like “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Bear,” “Paradise,” and “Chad Powers” didn’t convert their nominations into wins.​

Meanwhile, Disney+ received 15 nominations — including for “Andor” and “Elio” — but did not secure any wins this year.​

The Golden Globes also notably introduced a best podcast category, which Amy Poehler won for “Good Hang with Amy Poehler.” Other nominees included Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” and “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard.”

            <h2>Bob Weir Made the Grateful Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/bob-weir-grateful-dead-obituary/685586/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the summer of 1968, three years into the Grateful Dead’s existence, the band fired singer and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir. Jerry Garcia, the band’s other guitarist and its reluctant leader, and bassist Phil Lesh had decided that Weir and keyboardist Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were dragging the band down musically. Weir was just 20 years old, the youngest member of the group and the least technically accomplished. But Garcia didn’t have the heart to pull the trigger himself, and he made the band’s manager do the deed. Or at least he tried to. “It didn’t take. We fired them, all right, but they just kept coming back,” Garcia remembered later.

The failure was auspicious. A few months later, the band performed the shows that would be released as Live/Dead, one of the greatest psychedelic albums ever. The first sound heard on the record is Weir’s guitar, which methodically builds “Dark Star” up, sewing together Garcia and Lesh’s riffing. Weir’s place in the Dead was never again in doubt. When the group disbanded after Garcia’s death in 1995, Weir continued to lead or co-lead iterations of the band for another 30 years, culminating in a three-night 60th-anniversary celebration in San Francisco this past August. He died Saturday at 78, from complications of cancer.

Weir lived his entire adult life in the shadow of Garcia, a formidable genius who died too young, but he was more than just a backing musician. Garcia gave the band virtuosity; Lesh, with his avant-garde training, gave it ambition. Weir gave it soul and fun, and his underappreciated guitar playing was the glue that held the whole Dead sound together.

In a group of scruffy hippies, Weir was a bit of a misfit—ironically, by virtue of being normal. He was a prep-school kid, adopted by a well-off family from Palo Alto, California. But he was also perpetually getting kicked out of schools for misconduct—perhaps a side effect of his undiagnosed dyslexia—and his personal struggles helped lead him to Garcia. (It’s also how he met John Perry Barlow, a boarding-school classmate who would become his songwriting partner as well as an internet pioneer.)

Weir’s age made him the band’s little brother, and like many younger siblings, he could be embarrassing. In contrast to Garcia, who was famously impassive onstage, Weir had front-man energy. He sometimes came off as a pretty boy, and had a tendency to hit a helium falsetto in moments of excitement. After Pigpen’s death, he became the band’s standard-bearer for its lecherous blues songs. His flirtation with slide guitar in the late 1970s and ’80s was mediocre at best. And the less said about those short shorts, the better.

The magic of a band, though, comes from looking past any member’s individual foibles to see how they contribute to the whole, and it’s impossible to imagine the Dead functioning without Weir. During concerts, the set list would customarily alternate between songs sung by Garcia and songs sung by Weir, which was essential to maintaining interest and dynamism across their hours-long shows. Weir was the more conventionally talented singer, and sometimes what you need after the mawkish Garcia dirge “Wharf Rat” is Weir’s euphoric and randy “Sugar Magnolia.” (This change of vibe might be especially urgent and welcome if, like many attendees at Dead shows, you were experimenting with psychedelic drugs.)

Part of the Dead’s greatness resided in their integration of nearly the full breadth of American music: jug bands, modal jazz, Charles Ives, Motown. Weir’s role was often to inject swagger or grease, delivering signature renditions of songs by the likes of Chuck Berry, Merle Haggard, the Reverend Gary Davis, and Marty Robbins as well as upbeat originals such as “Greatest Story Ever Told.” But Weir wasn’t adept in only bluesy numbers. A ballad such as “Looks Like Rain” and “Black-Throated Wind” can grab you by the chest. My top criterion for judging a tape of a Dead show is usually the presence and quality of a rendition of Weir’s “Playing in the Band,” which elevates a boring trope—a song about being a rock and roller—into transcendence, with long, proggy passages.

Less obvious than his singing, but more singular, was Weir’s guitar playing. A typical rhythm guitarist aims to keep a song moving with chunky chords that outline the harmony of a song but also maintain the beat. The Grateful Dead had different needs: The group had to provide effective backing for Garcia’s solos, and it had to be able to morph from one song to another via collectively improvised jams. But it also had two drummers rather than one; an exploratory, meandering bassist; and a rotating cast of keyboardists. Standard rhythm playing would only have cluttered the sound.

Weir responded by developing a style unlike any previous rock guitarist, and one that even most contemporary jam bands can’t replicate. In place of steady strumming, Weir played arpeggios, single notes, little riffs, and odd, jazzy chords. One reason I and many other Deadheads favor concert recordings from the early 1970s is that drummer Mickey Hart’s temporary departure from the band left more room to hear and appreciate Weir’s playing. His model, he liked to say, was the jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s work in the John Coltrane Quartet. This is also a fitting analogy for Weir’s relationship with Garcia: Both Weir and Tyner rose to fame playing behind immortals, but that in no way detracts from either musician’s individual brilliance.

Weir also never succumbed to the bad habits of many of his bandmates, or at least never so deeply. McKernan’s drinking killed him at 27. Garcia’s drug abuse contributed to his death at 53. Lesh required a kidney transplant because of drug use. Keyboardist Brent Mydland overdosed at 37. But Weir lived more cleanly and, in later life, became something of an Instagram fitness influencer. When Garcia’s drug use caused his consistency and abilities to falter in the 1980s and ’90s, Weir helped carry the band.

In addition to leading his own bands, including RatDog and the Wolf Bros, Weir was involved in a series of projects that kept the repertoire alive. There was Furthur, then the Other Ones (a pun on a Dead song title), and later the Dead. After that came Dead & Company, in which he traded licks and songs with the pop singer John Mayer, who improbably won over many Deadheads. Hardly anyone could have been surprised that Dead & Company was booked as one of the first bands to have a residency at the Sphere, the elaborate Las Vegas venue. The Sphere promised “immersive” experiences; with the Dead, Weir had been delivering those for decades. Deadheads—those old enough to remember the Summer of Love and those born well after Garcia’s death—flocked to Vegas to partake.

In the past few years, many fans had noted that Weir’s pace had slowed—sometimes literally, as he throttled classic Dead tunes down to somnolent tempos. Over time, his appearance morphed from babyfaced to Yosemite Sam; he grew a bushy white beard late in life. Even so, that Weir might be gone so soon seemed unthinkable. After all, he was the youthful, energetic one; his passing feels like the end of an era, just as Garcia’s did. (With Weir’s death, only drummers Hart and Bill Kreutzmann survive as core members of the Dead.)

Even at an age when he’d earned the right to retire, Weir continued to write, record, and perform to adoring crowds, as though compelled to go on. Last August, in one of the final Dead & Company concerts, he performed a song that might have been a personal mission statement. The 77-year-old Weir sang words he’d written at 24: “I can’t stop for nothing / I’m just playing in the band.” It was never just playing, though.</div>

            <h2>The Best Flu Drug Americans Aren’t Taking</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/better-flu-drug-than-tamiflu/685585/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Antiviral drugs for influenza, the best known of which is Tamiflu, are—let’s be honest—not exactly miracle cures. They marginally shorten the course of illness, especially if taken within the first 48 hours. But amid possibly the worst flu season in 25 years, driven by a variant imperfectly matched to the vaccine, these underused drugs can make a bout of flu a little less miserable. So consider an antiviral. And specifically, consider Xofluza, a lesser-known drug that is in fact better than Tamiflu.

The culprit behind this awful flu season is subclade K, a variant of H3N2 discovered too late to be incorporated into this year’s flu vaccine. Early data suggest the shot likely does confer at least some protection against this variant, but the jury is still out on whether that protection is much eroded from usual. What is undeniable, though, is a recent explosion of influenza cases. In New York, which was hit early and hard, the number of people hospitalized for flu broke records. Across the rest of the country, cases have been going up a “straight line,” nearly everywhere all at once, which is highly unusual, Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who has been studying influenza for some 60 years, told me last week. Cases seem to be finally leveling off now, but much misery still lies ahead.

For flu, antivirals are a second but oft-overlooked line of defense after vaccines. “We are dramatically and drastically underutilizing influenza antivirals,” Janet Englund, a pediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of Washington, told me. Even the older, more commonly prescribed drug Tamiflu reaches only a tiny percentage of flu patients every year. Actual numbers are hard to come by, but compare the estimated 1.2 million prescriptions for Tamiflu and its generic form in 2023 with the some 40 million people who likely got the flu in the winter of 2023–24. Xofluza is even less popular, and exact prescription numbers even harder to find. But they are possibly somewhere from just 1 to 10 percent that of Tamiflu.

The two antivirals are equally effective at allaying symptoms, both shortening the duration of flu by about a day. But Xofluza, which was approved in 2018, offers some tangible benefits over Tamiflu.

First, Xofluza is simply more convenient, a single dose compared with Tamiflu’s 10, which are taken over five days, twice a day. It also causes fewer of the gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting and nausea, that patients on Tamiflu will sometimes experience. All in all, a course of Xofluza might be easier for you—or your kid already queasy from the flu itself—to get down and keep down. (That is, if they are old enough to take it: Xofluza is approved for kids ages 5 and up in the United States, but ages 1 and up in Europe; only Tamiflu is recommended for kids down to newborn age as well as for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.)

Second, Xofluza makes you less contagious to the rest of your family. It drives down the amount of virus spewed by sick patients more quickly than Tamiflu, possibly because of differences in how the two drugs work. Whereas Xofluza stops the virus from replicating, Tamiflu can only prevent already replicated viruses from exiting infected cells to infect others. In a study that Monto led last year, Xofluza cut household transmission by almost one-third compared with a placebo. Tamiflu might reduce transmission too, according to other studies, but probably to a lesser degree than Xofluza.

Third, Xofluza is better at heading off serious post-flu complications such as pneumonia or myocarditis. Patients on Xofluza needed fewer ER visits and hospitalizations than did those on Tamiflu, according to studies of large real-world data sets from insurance claims and medical records. This means that Xofluza should be the antiviral of choice for high-risk patients, including those over 65, who are most prone to these complications, Frederick Hayden, a flu expert at the University of Virginia who led one of the original Xofluza trials, told me. (Hayden has consulted on an unpaid basis, aside from travel expenses, for the companies behind Xofluza.)

The fourth advantage is less relevant to this season because the dominant subclade belongs to the influenza A family. But Xofluza is noticeably more effective against influenza B than Tamiflu, which tends to falter against this family of viruses.

Despite these benefits, awareness of Xofluza remains low. “It hasn’t been used as much as it should be,” Monto said, for reasons of cost and accessibility. Tamiflu, first approved in 1999, is available as a generic for less than $30 even without insurance. Xofluza is still patented and runs $150 to $200 a person. Because it’s less popular, pharmacies are less likely to stock it, making doctors less eager to prescribe it, and so on. In October, though, the company that markets Xofluza in the U.S. launched a direct-to-customer program that sells the drug for the comparably bargain price of $50 without insurance, along with same-day delivery in some areas. Even the flu-drug experts I spoke with, though, were not all aware of this new, more accessible route. The CDC still lists Tamiflu first and foremost in its recommendations, too.

For flu antivirals to be more widely used would also require better testing. Both Xofluza and Tamiflu are most effective within the first 48 hours of symptoms, and the earlier the better. Traditionally, a sick person would have to get to a doctor, get a flu test, get a prescription, and finally get to a pharmacy—which can easily put them past the first 48 hours. But COVID popularized at-home rapid testing, and combination COVID-flu tests have landed on pharmacies shelves recently. With telehealth and home delivery, you can get an antiviral without ever leaving the house.

Still, the at-home tests are expensive, Englund pointed out, about $20 a pop here, compared with just a couple of bucks in Europe. The expense can add up for a whole family. In Japan, where antivirals are widely used, nearly everyone with a flu-like illness gets a routine rapid test and, if necessary, antivirals, both largely covered by the public health-care system. (Xofluza was developed by the Japanese company Shionogi, which also makes Xocova, a promising COVID antiviral my colleague Rachel Gutman-Wei has written about that is not available in the U.S.)

If the U.S. were better at using antivirals, especially in the high-risk patients, the number of Americans dying of flu—roughly 38,000 last year—would likely drop, Cameron Wolfe, an infectious-diseases expert at Duke, told me. Doctors recommend that people at high risk for flu take antivirals prophylactically, upon exposure to anyone with flu, before symptoms appear. Both Xocova and Tamiflu as prophylaxis can cut the chances of getting sick by upwards of 80 percent.

For healthy people who fall ill, antivirals can ease the burden of flu, which is nasty even when it is not deadly. “I don’t want you to be out of work longer than you need to be. I don’t want you to not be a caregiver for your kids,” Wolfe said. “Maybe you have business travel coming up, and I don’t want you to be sick still on that plane.” With challenges around access to antivirals, he said that “the best drug is the one you can get.” Both Tamiflu and Xofluza can make this historically bad flu season a little more bearable.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than Donald Trump, more than Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, more than anyone in ICE’s leadership, J. D. Vance has made himself the lead defender of the killing in Minnesota. Why?

The day after the shooting, Vance announced a new administration effort to prosecute welfare fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere. Vance’s message started hot and got hotter. He blamed immigrants in general—and Somali immigrants in particular—for cheating taxpayers and raising the cost of child care for Americans. Then he launched into a denunciation of Renee Nicole Good, the woman shot dead in Minneapolis. He accused her of intentionally attacking a federal agent with her car. He alleged that she belonged to a broader network of activists who plotted “to attack, to dox, to assault” federal law enforcement. He blasted media outlets for covering her killer unsympathetically.

Nick Miroff: From “I’m not mad at you” to deadly shots in seconds

Vance’s words were not a spontaneous reaction to an unexpected question. They were planned, the message he arrived to drive. He did not wait for all of the facts. He did not bother with any notes of compassion for the dead woman and her grieving family.

The vice president next took to X, first to promote a video from the shooter’s point of view, then to mix it up with a journalist about that video (“He is allowed to discharge his weapon in self-defense”).

He did not have to do any of that. He could have expressed support for law enforcement more generally. He did not have to malign the victim. He did not have to champion the shooter. He did not have to insert himself as the main character in a story that was still only just coming into view.

That he did so may seem especially bold given the political context. According to a poll taken the same day as the shooting in Minneapolis, the public has turned against ICE’s often-brutal methods. A majority of Americans condemn ICE as “too forceful.” Vance began his term as perhaps the least popular new vice president in the history of polling. Identifying himself with ICE at its deadliest might seem a hazardous move for such a disliked politician.

But there is a logic to Vance’s combative stance. Vance clearly understood what ICE means to Trump’s base.

For MAGA America, ICE is an instrument for cleansing violence. Visit ICE social-media accounts and you’ll see, again and again, videos of armed force against unarmed individuals, against a soundtrack of pumping music. There’s a montage of aggressive arrests in Minnesota of unarmed, nonwhite men, many of them thrown to the ground and cuffed, set to the 1977 hit “Cold as Ice”: “Someday you’ll pay the price.” A dozen heavily armed and armored agents round up a single unarmed woman in a T-shirt and two similarly defenseless men in California. In Indiana, armored agents throw handcuffs and ankle chains on a big haul of men and shove them in a cell, where they can be seen pacing, weeping, or with their heads plunged in their hands.

Rarely do these videos present a situation that couldn’t be managed with a couple of plainclothes officers bearing holstered sidearms. The point is to prove that the fearsome power of the American state is being wielded by righteous MAGA hands against despised MAGA targets.

On the afternoon of January 9, the DHS X account posted an image of a lone cowboy riding through some Western landscape while a stealth bomber flies overhead. Across the image are the words “We’ll have our home again.” You may not recognize the phrase. It’s a lyric of a song that’s popular on the nationalist far right:

In our own towns, we’re foreigners now, our names are spat and cursed The headlines smack of another attack, not the last, and not the worst Oh my fathers they look down on me, I wonder what they feel To see their noble sons driven down, beneath a coward’s heel

Oh by God we’ll have our home again, by God we’ll have our home By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet, by God we’ll have our home

That is not a paean to law enforcement. MAGA Republicans do not reliably care about laws or the people who enforce them. One of Trump’s first actions upon entering office was to pardon more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, including many convicted of violent offenses against the police. He has denigrated the FBI and transformed the agency into a tool of retribution, and he regularly disparages prosecutors and law-enforcement officials if they fail to comply with his will.

The only law-enforcement agency the administration consistently champions happens to have a particularly grim record of violent overreactions. According to The Trace, which tracks gun violence generally, Good was one of four people who have been killed by ICE since the crackdown began in June, and the organization has identified more than 30 incidents in which immigration agents have either opened fire or held someone at gunpoint. Border Patrol agents have also shot at least three people who were simply observing or documenting immigration raids, including a 30-year-old American woman in Chicago, at whom an agent shouted “Do something, bitch” before opening fire with an assault rifle. She was hit five times but somehow survived.

Caitlin Dickerson: How ICE lost its guardrails

This count doesn’t include the many reported incidents of physical assaults without guns, such as choking and body slams, including of elderly men and women. More and worse scenes have been recorded in Minnesota this past weekend.

ICE is violence-prone in part because the agency has lowered its training standards and ditched much of its background vetting to meet the president’s grandiose deportation targets. But more fundamentally, ICE is violence-prone because its main purpose has become theatrical. Under present leadership, ICE is less a law-enforcement agency than it is a content creator.

Americans want borders enforced. They want foreign criminals apprehended and deported. They want unfounded asylum claimants to be removed promptly. But most Americans don’t thrill to spectacular acts of six-on-one violence aimed at DoorDash delivery men. ICE’s approval ratings have duly plummeted.

Again and again, ICE agents are encountering members of the public who reject their protection and sympathize with the supposed invaders. Yet ICE’s powers against U.S. citizens are limited. Americans can record ICE operations, follow ICE motorcades, and vex and annoy ICE personnel, and there’s not much that ICE or Border Patrol agents can legally do to stop them—hence the turn to unlawful force instead.

That’s the mentality the whole world saw in videos of the killing of Good in Minneapolis, including the one seemingly recorded by the shooter himself. The ICE agent will likely argue that he opened fire on Good—who was unarmed and driving away—to save his own life. But the videos also raise the possibility that he fired because he felt disrespected by a person who—in his opinion—owed him deference. ICE agents who use violence may be counting on superiors to back them up, because they feel disrespected too, and by the whole ungrateful country. Which returns us to Vance and his don’t bother me with the facts defense of the ICE shooter.

MAGA is many things, but above all it’s a movement about redistributing respect away from those who command too much (overeducated coastal elites) to those who don’t have enough (white Americans without advanced degrees who feel left behind). You see that redistribution at work in the Trump administration’s project to devalue medical experts and empower wellness gurus and vaccine skeptics, and in its dismissal of “deep state” national-security professionals in favor of TV pundits.

Nowhere does the demand to redistribute respect come into starker view than when guns start firing. In Trump’s first term, Kyle Rittenhouse—who shot and killed two men and injured a third during protests against police brutality in Wisconsin in August 2020—became a MAGA hero largely because he was enforcing the MAGA vision of respect due. Many Americans saw him as a trigger-happy 17-year-old vigilante, but to the MAGA faithful he was a brave soldier in the larger war against MAGA enemies, real and imagined.

The ICE agent who killed Good is Trump’s second-term Kyle Rittenhouse. Of course the agent could have walked away and left everyone unharmed. By law, perhaps he should have walked away: It’s generally illegal for a law-enforcement officer to kill a civilian seeking to escape, more so if the civilian is unarmed, and even more so if the civilian is not a criminal suspect of any kind. But letting protesters drive off unscathed, without punishing them for their disrespect, would let them “get away with it.” And that would be an intolerable affront to the MAGA vision of who must submit to whom.

Idrees Kahloon: The return of MAGA’s favorite forbidden book

By coming so vociferously to the shooter’s defense, Vance full-throatedly committed himself to the MAGA mission of enforcing respect by any means necessary. Because there’s always such a strong whiff of cynical calculation and inauthenticity about Vance, he has to say more and go further than many natural MAGA personalities do. He has to pay moral cash where others might be trusted on moral credit. If the Minneapolis shooter is the next Kyle Rittenhouse, Vance dared not delay before thrusting himself at this new MAGA hero’s side.

This is how we arrive at a moment when the country’s highest-ranking officials are endorsing a lethal shooting on the basis of claims refuted by the evidence. Failure to heed the MAGA campaign to redistribute respect is insolence punishable by death.</div>

            <h2>The Court Case That Is Allowing ICE to Stop Just About Anyone It Wants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For 30 years, law-enforcement officers have been empowered to be “clever”—and that cleverness has today become the cover for abusive actions by ICE.

In 1996, the Supreme Court decided Whren v. United States, which came about when plainclothes vice officers patrolling in the District of Columbia passed a truck in a “high drug” area and “their suspicions were aroused.” They had a hunch that the truck was involved in a drug operation. They chose to wait until it had violated a traffic ordinance (turning without a signal) and then used that violation as an excuse to stop the truck. In the course of searching the truck, they found crack cocaine.

The Supreme Court said that the temporary detention of a motorist “upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws” did not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law-enforcement purpose. The Court developed a rule of objective intent. Under this theory, if the officers had a valid reason for acting—an objectively reasonable intention, in the Court’s terminology—then their true motive and subjective intent was of no constitutional consequence. A pretextual traffic stop to search for drugs was just fine with the Court.

Adam Serwer: Conservatives want the antebellum Constitution back

That decision, though couched as an application of the Fourth Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard, was grounded on two premises that were plausible at the time. First, that the discretionary authority granted to the police would be used against genuine criminals such as drug dealers. Second, that the occasional misuses of that discretion would be few, far between, and manageable by the court system through robust testing and oversight. Any harm that could possibly occur was outweighed by the good that would be achieved.

Whren has long plagued minority communities, leading to countless incidents of racial profiling. The current use of Whren in the immigration context takes these abuses further yet, singling out people not on suspicion of criminal behavior but for noncriminal immigration enforcement. Both of the premises in Whren, if they ever were accurate, are now manifestly false. Officer discretion is not being deployed solely against possibly malevolent actors, and the misuse of that discretion is causing more harm than good, not only to those illegally present, but also to those here legally, including U.S. citizens.

The confluence of Whren and ICE is easily captured anecdotally. In Washington, D.C., for example, the U.S. Park Police (a federal police agency) is responsible for enforcing traffic laws on Rock Creek Parkway, a piece of federal land. Since the ICE crackdown began, the park police have begun pulling over commercial trucks for technical violations—say, obscured license plates or driving on the noncommercial parkway—and then allowing ICE to arrest those suspected of immigration violations. To the same effect in D.C., delivery drivers are at risk of being stopped for traffic violations and then being sucked into the immigration-enforcement machine. It’s not just D.C.; the crackdown is nationwide. ICE detentions start with minor traffic violations in Phoenix. In Florida, they begin at truck inspection checkpoints. Or, in Montana, with a broken taillight. Unsurprisingly, the traffic crackdown is not race-neutral. In South Florida, for example, ICE is targeting specific types of work trucks typically driven by people of color.

Even 30 years ago, the Court’s view rested on shaky empirical foundations. It adopted the rule of objective intent despite understanding that, at least sometimes, the subjective intent of the officer might be invidious. The Court recognized that instead of targeting suspicious vehicles in a high-crime area, an officer might have been the sort who targeted a car filled with Black Americans simply because of their skin color. But the Court had a general view that the police were typically trustworthy and honest, and it wrote a rule based on that assumption.

This rule was attractive to the Court because subjective intent is much more difficult to assess than objective factors. It is hard to know what someone else is really thinking, even if you know them quite well. Many judges know that they are particularly ill-suited to assess spur-of-the-moment motivation when sitting in the quiet of their chambers. Worse yet, adopting a rule that asks an officer to explain his motivation is just a formula to solicit perjury—a rule that relies on subjective intent would give any officer an incentive to shade the truth and embellish on his thought process.

But the incentives for officers to shade the truth are really no different under either the objective standard or the subjective one. Just as a law-enforcement officer may sometimes gild the lily in describing his thought process, he may also do so in describing the objective facts that he has observed. I had one case, many years ago, in which my client was suspected of engaging in a drug transaction. The police broadcast a lookout for his car, and he was pulled over for a traffic violation. His offense? Allegedly driving faster than 15 miles per hour in a mall parking lot. But given the configuration of the lot and the presence of other parked cars, the officer’s contention that the car was speeding was dubious at best. Still, he had offered an objectively valid ground for the stop, and my client was duly convicted based on the drugs found in his car.

Whren’s logic has always been a formula for abuse, but that abuse has come especially to the fore today, when acted on by ICE agents who, far from investigating federal crimes, are deploying their authority in the service of noncriminal immigration enforcement to satisfy Trump’s deportation quota. Without any actual knowledge that a crime may have been committed, ICE officers can convert an everyday occurrence that almost every person in America does routinely (rolling through a stop sign, say) into the pretext for arrest that can lead to banishment.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Whren’s most fundamental error was the Court’s implicit assumption that malicious intent by law-enforcement officers was a rare subset of justified traffic stops. Back then, the Court might plausibly have given law enforcement the benefit of the doubt. Today, the current conduct of federal law enforcement—and most particularly ICE investigations where criminal activity is not generally at issue—seems to be different both in degree and in kind from what the law might reasonably have anticipated decades ago.

It is, no doubt, too much to hope that the Court, as currently constituted, will revisit this unwise decision. But if there ever comes a time when reconsideration is possible, Whren should be scrapped, and a rule of subjective intent should be adopted that is more aligned with what we now know about the possibility of authoritarian abuse. ICE’s conduct, if it has taught us anything, has taught us not to blindly trust the good intentions of law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Banana Republicanism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-desperate-powell-investigation/685583/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on grounds so flimsy and transparently hypocritical that it is difficult to know whether anybody is supposed to take the charges at face value. When a respected public servant is being accused of wasting taxpayer dollars and lying to Congress by a president whose extravagant White House renovation has already doubled in cost in just three months, and whose inexhaustible capacity for lies has essentially broken every fact-checking medium, one almost wonders if the criminal allegation was chosen for its absurdity, to demonstrate that Donald Trump can make the law mean whatever he wants it to.

Trump’s gambit is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. Powell’s term ends in four months, a timeline so brief that it wouldn’t be hastened by even a well-founded criminal charge, which this is not. In theory, harassing Powell with trumped-up charges could intimidate him into backing down, but the Fed chair responded with a defiant statement. Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed not to support any new nominees to the Federal Reserve board “until this legal matter is fully resolved.” And even if Trump were to manage to install sufficiently pliant figureheads at the agency, the Fed’s demonstrable lack of independence would be apt to weaken its influence over monetary policy and make the economy worse, not better.

What’s more, Trump is gambling that his control over the Republican Party is so unshakable that he can extend his banana republicanism to a policy domain that matters deeply to his wealthy partisan allies. Those conservative economic elites who don’t actively cheer on Trump’s authoritarianism and corruption have learned to live with both, because he delivers the goods in the policy realms that matter to them: tax cuts, deregulation, and other conservative economic priorities.

Every affluent Republican, from the tech right to fossil-fuel owners to heirs managing their inherited portfolios, has a direct and visible interest in stable and competent monetary policy. The Republican Party’s respect for the Fed’s independence is already evident in a recent Supreme Court ruling, in which the conservative majority appears to be seeking to create a special exemption for the Federal Reserve from the Court’s general doctrine that presidents are entitled to fire the heads of independent agencies. When Trump messes with the Fed, he is defecating where his wealthy donors eat. Perhaps they will go along with this, too, but he is testing the limits of their acquiescence.

Rogé Karma: Trump is getting closer to having an ‘infinite money pit’

The apparent source of this desperate gamble is that Trump seems keenly aware that the public disapproves of his presidency and his economic policy making. But rather than move to the center and try to allay the concerns of his wavering supporters, Trump’s response to adversity has been to try to seize as much economic and political power as he can, as fast as possible.

Thus the invasion of Venezuela, which he hopes will provide him with a windfall source of petro-dollars. (Sunday night, Trump shared on Truth Social a mock biography describing himself as “Acting President of Venezuela.”) After floating a proposal to cap credit-card interest rates that stands little chance of passage in Congress, he told reporters on Air Force One that firms that fail to comply with his target by January 20—before any law capping interest rates can conceivably make it through the House and Senate—will be “in violation of the law.”

In normal times, private companies could simply laugh off a president’s threat that they have “violated” a law that does not exist. But since Trump has amply demonstrated his eagerness to redefine the law as synonymous with his own whims, his threats may well contain real power.

Trump’s clumsy legal intimidation of Powell mirrors tactics used by regimes such as those of Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This is not a list of the most prosperous economies in the modern world. What these states have in common (with the exception of Argentina, which has rebuilt its economic and political systems from the setbacks they suffered under disastrous Trump-style experiments) is an entrenched elite that hoards wealth and control.

Caitlin B. Tully: The Court has an easy answer on the Fed

The administration is fond of accusing immigrant communities of importing dysfunctional political cultures from the developing world. “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen? You’re gonna replicate the conditions that they left,” Stephen Miller recently told Fox News.

The global South may be cursed with more than its share of regimes in which economic success depends on political access and the rule of law is a bitter joke. However, it is not the desperate refugees fleeing poverty and oppression who are importing their political culture, but Trump himself.</div>

            <h2>What <em>Black Swan</em> Knew About Leaning In</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/black-swan-women-workplace-movie/685564/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film, Black Swan, fit into a lot of boxes. It was a psychological thriller, a body-horror flick, a character study, a coming-of-age saga. It was a cautionary tale about ballet culture, helicopter parenting, and perfectionism. Rewatching it roughly 15 years after its release, though, I’ve come to see it as something else: a workplace drama, about an ambitious woman navigating a hypercompetitive environment, contorting herself to please the mercurial boss who holds her fate in his hands.

The ballet world is, of course, unique—a field that requires uncommon athletic and artistic mastery, as well as more commitment and sacrifice than most 9-to-5 jobs. The path to success for a dancer doesn’t necessarily look the same as that of a corporate employee. Yet Black Swan’s central character, Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, struggles in ways that feel broadly relatable.

Like many young strivers, Nina has wound up with her identity entirely entangled in her job. When she lands her dream role in Swan Lake, playing both the innocent White Swan loved by a prince and the seductive Black Swan who attempts to steal him away, she throws herself into her work. But recognition always seems out of reach. The company’s director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), keeps telling Nina she’s too “frigid” and sexless to play the Black Swan. The other dancers covet her part and make her feel unworthy of it. (In any industry, sparse opportunities can lead to hungry, cutthroat workers.) Nina has no mentor to look up to; Beth, the former prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder, has been ruthlessly excised from the company for being too old. The film implies that Beth is still as capable as ever of performing beautifully; the company simply wants a “fresh face,” as Thomas puts it, to draw audiences. Here as in so many workplaces, employees are expendable, valued not for their personhood but for their present contribution to the bottom line.

On top of all that, Thomas keeps coming on to Nina, arguing that she needs to loosen up to get in touch with her inner Black Swan. He asks if she’s a virgin, tells her to masturbate (homework), and kisses her (more than once). This of course puts her in an impossible position: If she protests, she’ll be proving his point that she’s too uptight; if she relents, she’ll be proving right the other dancers’ suspicion that she exploited his attraction to get the part. Thomas’s fiefdom seems similar to that of many real-life dance companies in that power is concentrated in a man with few checks on his behavior. His harassment evokes some of the abuse accusations that have rocked the ballet world—but also the kind of #MeToo stories that have emerged in numerous fields. And as Nina struggles to focus, Thomas keeps telling her, cruelly: “The only person standing in your way is you.”

That idea—and the disturbing question of whether it’s true—is one that I imagine haunts many working women. Around the time Black Swan came out, high-powered female executives were making headlines, and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Women could see that incredible professional success was possible—but this didn’t mean they were in a position to achieve it. In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer of Meta, delivered a diagnosis in her best-selling book Lean In: Women tend to deny themselves career success, she argued, because they internalize the idea that they should be meek and deferential, and thus take “their foot off the gas,” as she put it in one TED Talk. Instead, she asserted, they need to be bold: speak up in meetings; ask for that raise. Sandberg’s philosophy, I realized, is rather Thomas-esque. In one scene, seemingly testing Nina, he tells her that she won’t be getting the main role in Swan Lake—then berates her for accepting his decision rather than fighting him on it. “You could be brilliant,” he tells her later. “But you’re a coward.”

Though Lean In was a hit—people like to feel that they have agency—it also stirred immediate controversy for its insistence that women could change their circumstances through sheer force of will. Sandberg eventually gave more credence to the structural causes of professional inequity and acknowledged that she hadn’t truly understood the plight of, say, working single moms. But three years before her book was published, Black Swan had already captured one of the problems with holding yourself entirely responsible for your own success: It can turn you against yourself. In a sense, Thomas’s warning that Nina is getting in her own way is a self-fulfilling prophecy. She becomes her own worst enemy.

Aronofsky has said that he based Black Swan on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s short 1846 novel The Double, about a struggling low-level civil servant who finds that a man has joined his office who looks exactly like him—but who is far more charming and well liked by their colleagues. They become nemeses, naturally. (The Double was also made into its own movie, starring Jesse Eisenberg, in 2013.) In Black Swan, Nina is surrounded by creepy mirror images. Sometimes, her reflection, in the studio’s great glass wall, stops mimicking her actions. Sometimes she hallucinates that people walking down the street or dancing across from her have her face. Primarily, though, Nina’s double—the far more charming, better-liked version of her—is a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis), a clear Black Swan to Nina’s White one. When Nina despises Lily, she is despising herself. Eventually Nina grows paranoid, losing her grip on what’s real and what’s not. Her breakdown is far more dramatic than what most people will ever experience, but it illustrates the way in which endless, lonely toil can alienate a person from herself. It’s the extreme but logical conclusion of adopting a bootstrap mentality under conditions that don’t actually allow you to pull yourself up.

The path for ambitious women today may be even more obscure than it was upon Black Swan’s release. Politicians, academics, pundits, and influencers are challenging not only the idea that women should be CEOs but also that they should be in the workforce at all (or able to vote). McKinsey’s annual Women in the Workplace study of corporate America—co-conducted by Sandberg’s LeanIn.org and published last month—found that “women are as dedicated to their careers as men” but that they tend to receive less mentorship at work and, in senior positions, remain outnumbered by men. Some companies, according to McKinsey’s report, had recently cut programs designed to support women; many had curtailed remote- or flexible-work options, which are generally a boon to moms trying to keep their jobs. For the first time since McKinsey began conducting its study, female participants reported less desire for promotion than male participants did.

Yet when men and women receive similar amounts of support from senior colleagues, the report found, any ambition gap between the sexes disappears. Women, this suggests, care plenty about what they do and whether they’re seen. Only when they feel undervalued or have little hope of advancement are they more likely to pull back.

Something that struck me when I rewatched Black Swan was all the little reminders that Nina once really loved ballet, before the job wore her down. And I wondered: What if she’d had a less predatory director in a less punishing environment? What if she’d had someone to help her tap into that love without losing her mind? One of the saddest parts of Black Swan is seeing Nina’s passion for dance draining out of her. Thomas keeps telling her to feel the music, to not just to go through the motions. By the time he’s got his grip on her, it’s too late.

[...] those windowless borders are a horror.

Indeed! Even worse than borderless windows.

I&#39;ve been on 26 for a while.. (months, when did it come out?) And I didn&#39;t even know this was a thing. And yes I do resize windows a lot, and would definitely notice some annoying shit like that.

I&#39;m on 26.3 right now (developer beta) and I have used each iteration of 26 Tahoe along the way. I&#39;ve had no problem resizing windows.

Apple removed the visible resize grippy-strip from window corners in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion in July 2011.What chaps me is the mouse cursor, which does not change, not one iota, over about 90% of that grippable area. If we got a &#39;resize&#39; cursor image over the territory that could be grabbed, all of this would be a non-issue. Instead, the cursor flips over 1/n the width of the human hair, with n=the number of people bloody sick of interface changes for no damned reason.

Instead, the cursor flips over 1/n the width of the human hair, with n=the number of people bloody sick of interface changes for no damned reason.

Why doesn&#39;t the cursor change when it is on the point where one can resize the window?

I understand why electron apps reinventing the wheel fuckup basic UI guidelines (and for example forget triangle filters so menus become almost unusable), but how can a native UI on macOS fail to change the cursor when it is at the point for resizing the window?

Im on an MacOS 26 machine now and it definitely does, if the cursor hasn&#39;t changed I can&#39;t resize the window and when it does change I can.  I have a reasonable space both inside and outside the window to resize.

Sure the grippy thing is gone but it doesn&#39;t seem any harder to resize a window and I certainly get visual feedback

&quot;Why doesn&#39;t the cursor change when it is on the point where one can resize the window?&quot;

It does change on my 26.2 Macs. It changes from the usual pointer to what appears to be two diagonal arrows. And it does this for approx. 1/4 in square in the bottom right on my MB Pro 14 in. screen, M3.

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re considering popular, because in my testing of &quot;popular&quot; Linux distros with various desktop environments I have never had something like this. GNOME and KDE, the two most popular environments regardless of distro, both have plentifully large zones for resizing.

I disabled window decorations for flux/openbox on Linux years ago because using a key and mouse was more effective and made my desktop completely distraction free, as well as eliminated the space waste of the title bar.I no longer have to aim every time for that thin line on which I have to click and hold.

MacOS has always had an ugly UI with poor usability and design choices. Apple has literally never understood anything about software development or UI design, or even hardware design.

To me MacOS has always had a nice UI and they made good design choices. Who doesn&#39;t understand UIs is MS and whatever the Unix/Linux crowd uses.

I move the mouse to the corner, it changes shape, and I click and drag.  Done.

I&#39;ve never even noticed that this happens outside the window.

Scroll bars -- well they are a while other story.

I&#39;m going to call this a PEBCAK issue in the author.

I wasn&#39;t aware you could click on the inside until I tried it just now. I never thought about it too hard but always thought of it as grabbing the outside edge and stretching the window like a sheet of rubber or something.
  My guess is they looked at user data and the vast majority of users do this as well?

I don&#39;t need more window space if I can&#39;t use the product. Not only is this happening with OS&#39;s but it&#39;s happening with browsers and webpages with scroll bars. I&#39;d rather be able to find the scroll bar than save 4-12 pixels worth of screen space, which is usually 1/2 to 1/4 the size of a font in the app. Is it worth it? No. The problem is OS&#39;s are mature and the UI people still need a job, so what do they do? Keep changing things that don&#39;t need to be changed.

Then the problem is to get active if you are depressed. It&#39;s next to impossible.

I have been more or less depressed since I was a child.

In my late 30s, I started walking a lot, hitting my 10k nearly every day. I am in my late 40&#39;s now and my depression is quite manageable. I am consistently in a much better mood than I was in my earlier years. I have also lost quite a bit of weight (went from 250-270 to 200-210) and my lower back pain is nearly gone too.

So, there you go. Just get outside (preferably; vitamin D is very important) or get on the treadmi

Medicine is as effective as exercise for depression?

I lift weights.  12 ounces at a time.It isn&#39;t the weight that counts, it&#39;s the reps. I salute you

Anything that represents taking control of some component of your life will have this effect. Exercise is one of these. For others it might be cleaning the home that is neglected while depressed. Taking control of the environment surrounding you helps to take a bit of control over your internal environment. Basically any thing that pulls some control back from the universe and into yourself has great benefit.

I&#39;m not saying it was wasteful to study. It&#39;s not. Good for them. But the conclusion can be found rampant through literature on mental health.

It&#39;s a self-perpetuating cycle.  Depression makes it very hard to take control and do things.  People think of it as an illness of sadness but that&#39;s not really what it is.  Depression and ADHD both have a lot in common with relation to serotonin and dopamine.  Executive dysfunction is the umbrella term for not being able to initiate even simple tasks that bring happiness.  Medication is a good way to get you started, but modern medical practice tends to just stay with medicine instead of using something el

Great, it works on depression.  I can vouch for that.

So, how to get motivated to work out when the depression&#39;s got you by the yarballs?

Ahahha.... no answer for that one, right?

Sometimes I feel the psychology and psychiatry fields are populated with naught but charlatans.

So, how to get motivated to work out when the depression&#39;s got you by the yarballs?

Maybe it is the other way around. At the time when the depressions starts to lift, people can get around to be more active, and also do more exercise. Once the depression is over, they look back and see that as soon as they started exercising, things started to get better.

I don&#39;t know if Apple, a company that (supposedly) prides itself on protecting users&#39; privacy, partnering with one of the world&#39;s biggest Privacy Rapists is the flex they think it is.

I mean, Apple didn&#39;t have their own on par, and as others have said, at least it&#39;s not Nazi-Grok.

If the data is getting used by google though - someone&#39;s gonna be firing off an anti-trust lawsuit against Google over it - they&#39;d have nearly all of the smartphone AI going their way in a lot of markets.

This is when Microsoft, of all people, play the anti-monopolist card - lobbying the European Union to allow the choice of Copilot on all Android/iOS devices!

2025 Siri is dumb as hell, and only does about six things, but four of those things are really useful and work reliably enough to not have to worry about using them.  I&#39;m not sure I want anything &quot;smarter&quot;.

ios has pluggable keyboards.  Why not have pluggable AI?

Maybe this is the right thing for the country. Maybe it&#39;s not. Frankly, if Trump supports it, it probably isn&#39;t.Carrying a balance on a credit card with an interest rate that high is a death spiral for personal finances. At 19% interest it does not take long for a small loan to become extremely unaffordable. I don&#39;t have any idea of a cap on interest rates would result in more responsible spending, or if it would encourage *more* spending since the monthly payment seems lower.

Why is this different than when AOC proposed the same legislation?   The US &#39;usury&#39; rate caps have nearly doubled since the 1980&#39;s. The current rates would be immediately illegal and have been getting pushed higher by these companies operating at 50 percent profits.

Why is this different than when AOC proposed the same legislation?The answer is in the question:legislation

Why is this different than when AOC proposed the same legislation?

Aside from the legislation part, it&#39;s because she&#39;s the one who proposed doing this. Anything she proposes is verboten according to Republicans.

That, and if by chance a bank or two does do this (they won&#39;t, but hear me out), the Russian asset will get to claim he did it, not her.  Because everything is about him.

Also, if this would happen, it would be used as a political point. &quot;See?  I lowered your rates. You owe me. Elect who I say to elect.&quot;

I didn&#39;t solicit whataboutisms.  Stop trying to change the point that your anger for this legislation is that it might come from someone other than Bernie or Josh Hawley or AOC...  The message isn&#39;t the issue; it is who gets credit for it.

Here [slashdot.org] is the slashdot article where AOC&#39;s 10% cap was discussed. Interesting to look at the comments and observe the very different community reaction to the identical proposal with different name attached.

Sure, call it naivety or lack of education. To some extent that&#39;s valid. Certainly it was for me 37 years ago when I got my first card. But there are a whole lot of reasons, many of them external, that lead down that path as well. Otherwise knowledgeable and educated people looking for a stopgap during employment disruption need bridges, for example. If you&#39;re broke and your child is hungry, staring down incurring a future interest burden is less concerning than the immediate reality.

Zero accountability is exactly why most shut the fuck up real quick-like when bitching about what they can and cannot afford.Zero accountability for one side of the debt, but not the other.  It shouldn&#39;t be the government&#39;s job to make sure loans get repaid, but we routinely bail out lenders and set up systems where the most risky loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Lenders don&#39;t have to even bother checking borrower&#39;s ability to repay, which in theory is what lenders are supposed to do in our system.

It was only literally 18mons ago that we saw rates on things like HELOCs and 30 year mortgages in the 8.5% range.

certainly it isn&#39;t going to be sustainable to have unsecured debt and secured debt in such a tight range.  Clearly when prime rates are in that range it would be impossible to profitably extend unsecured credit at 10% at least on the default rates that are currently common in the credit card space.

So would we see a lot of lenders closing consumer credit card accounts, and not offering them to anyone with a less that stellar FICO score?

That is exactly what would happen. This is another Trump idea that sounds good when you say it but anyone who puts any thought into it finds very quickly it is a terrible idea. Everything he says is about getting people to like him. He says something like this so people will say &quot;that will help me, Donald Trump is a good guy and on my side&quot;. Meanwhile, if it happens, most of those same people will have their credit cards cancelled or not be able to get a card to begin with. He can then say it is all the banks faults not his. Trump is nothing but optics, once you look past the words and actually at how things works, everything falls apart.

In 2016 and early 2017, his brilliant plan for dealing with the US debt was to simply let it default and declare bankruptcy, discharging the debt and starting over. He figured that this would mean the US would have little to no debt left over and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the interest anymore. Fortunately, enough people told him that doing so would crash the national and global economies and turn the US into an economic pariah for generations. He hasn&#39;t really brought it up since.

Everything he says is about getting people to like him.Not anymore. Now it is about how can he line his pockets. This is just a ploy to get the finance industry to donate more to his &quot;campaign.&quot;

Considering how much credit card debt people are saddling themselves with, wouldn&#39;t having cards cancelled and/or not issued be a good thing?  Do you want to be hopelessly in debt?  If you&#39;re not hopelessly in debt, your credit score will reflect that, and you&#39;ll be able to continue using credit cards responsibly.  What&#39;s the downside?

Why is &quot;everyone gets a free pony&quot; such a terrible idea? Doesn&#39;t everyone like ponies? And these ponies are even better: they&#39;re free!

Now quit your leftist whining and tell me what address to write on this pony box. We spent a fuckton of tax money (double the market value) on this and I want to get your pony shipped out ASAP because feeding these things is costing a fortune.

Want a credit card? Then the bank must charge enough interest to pay for the costs associated with it and the defaults by people who don&#39;t pay back what they borrowed. If they don&#39;t, then lots of people won&#39;t have credit cards anymore.

If they don&#39;t, then lots of people won&#39;t have credit cards anymore.Which probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing overall.

Which probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing overall.Probably eventually, but in the shorter term we are talking about adding a lot new friction to the economy.

> That would be an immediate drastic reduction in demand, which would crush small businesses and large alike.

You havent sold that counterpoint. Crushing existing exploitative businesses and optional purchases is the point, but it cettainly wouldnt be immediate.

It would hit most businesses, exploitative and not. The US economy&#39;s backbone is effectively credit cards. Take those away, and a lot of people that use them as bridges between paychecks are going to have a hard time.

Yes lots of people who were not supposed to have credit card to begin with.

Okay.  Show us the costs associated with offering lines of consumer credit.

Most hotels and rental car companies accept debit cards connected to the credit networks, but they will put a lock on a certain amount of funds for incidentals. For cars and hotels, this is typically $300.

If I&#39;m outside of the UK, I usually use a debit card for that, because I can have one in the currency of the country I&#39;m visiting and it usually works out cheaper than foreign transaction fees on a credit card. That generally works just fine.

You absolutely can rent a car or stay at a hotel without a credit card. There are companies in both businesses that will happily put holds on a debit card. My phone company gives me a credit for paying my bill with a debit card instead of a credit card.

True, it&#39;s more convenient to use a credit card, but lack of convenience doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible to function without one.

Frankly, I think most of you don&#39;t really get it.

This is strictly about the midterm elections in November. Trump and the GOP know they&#39;re in trouble. Right now, Trump is coming up with stupid ideas, hoping to mollify enough of the electorate between now and November so the GOP doesn&#39;t get slaughtered in the house. There will certainly be more crazy ideas coming from him in the next month or two.

And, frankly, if none of that works (and it probably won&#39;t - the guy really isn&#39;t that bright)... I fully expect w

let&#39;s be real.  if you look at the polling both parties are in trouble.  Voters rate each very poorly.

Turn out defines midterm elections.  I would pretend to guess what will happen in November right now.  If Trump or the GOP can animate their base somehow, they could hold or even pickup.  If they do nothing they probably take a pounding.

If Spanburger or Mamdani do something that spooks people, Democrats might find any support beyond the just 40% of the population that hates

Credit card companies won&#39;t. It&#39;s not Visa an MasterCard issuing the debt. The banks will write it down, which will affect their bottom line and the results of their stress tests. They&#39;ll rein in credit lines, making it harder for people to do the things they want and need to do.

Remember we had to vote against Harris because she wanted anti-price gouging measures and those were declared un-American and Socialist (but they would have been actually voted on)

Here we get potential worse price controls and done via executive fiat because in this admin everything has to be run through the WH.  I don&#39;t even think Trump considers that Congress is a thing.

There are price controls today on wages for H2A visa workers.  The problem is that these prices are below market rate.  This causes undocumented workers to demand higher wages than documented ones.  This is bad for big ag, so the donor class really needs them to get documented.

Call it price controls or whatever, but I think the government needs to step in when the market fails.I don&#39;t disagree, but I&#39;m not seeing evidence that this is actually a market failure (at least to the degree of slashing rates to 10% being a proportionate response). From what I&#39;ve seen interest rates on credit cards are over 20% around the world.  I obviously can&#39;t prove that a global cabal of bankers isn&#39;t colluding to set that rate at an artificially high level internationally, but it seems more likely that it&#39;s simply the price of offering unsecured debt to the general public.

Call it price controls or whatever, but I think the government needs to step in when the market fails.

I don&#39;t disagree, but I&#39;m not seeing evidence that this is actually a market failure (at least to the degree of slashing rates to 10% being a proportionate response). From what I&#39;ve seen interest rates on credit cards are over 20% around the world.

Ah yes, the free market at work.Republicans have never cared about the free market.  It&#39;s only a talk point that holds zero water when looking at historical voting records and executive orders. (Fun fact: they don&#39;t care about states rights either.)

Their spin doctors like political convenience. And American voters appear to have very short term memories, so the behavior continues.

Then like the FAA downsizing and the loss of highway funds to California, this is a third way Trump is helping to increase demand for high speed rail. I hope he keeps it up!

&quot;LOL, I&#39;m sure people would see that they now have a 10% cap on their CC interest rate and jump to one with an interest rate more than 10%.If you are a high risk debtor you would not end up with a 10% capped CC: you would end up without CC altogether since creditors would deem the risk not adequately covered at a 10% cap.That&#39;s what would drive these high risk debtors to &quot;unregulated, more costly alternatives&quot;, since I doubt they suddenly would become eligible for better forms of credit, or not need the credit altogether.

That&#39;s what would drive these high risk debtors to &quot;unregulated, more costly alternatives&quot;, since I doubt they suddenly would become eligible for better forms of credit, or not need the credit altogether.

They would driven by the fact they want credit but now cannot get it from a major credit-card company.

Like if you can&#39;t get a car loan from your bank or a major dealer you end up at a buy-here-pay-here place which charged you 38% interest and massive penalties.

They would when the lender stops authorizing new charges.  Which read their contract, they certainly can do.

If the low interest rate is legally mandated then the risk profile changes. Maybe it will result in banks not giving people with crap credit ratings credit cards if they can&#39;t monetise them and result in better spending management.

The Orange Doofus cares not for unintended consequences.  Cap credit card rates at 10%?  Sure, then banks will stop extending credit to millions of people with marginal credit ratings.  &quot;Sorry, but we&#39;re canceling your credit card... we can&#39;t price your risk appropriately.&quot;

That leads to much less consumer spending, which leads to recession.  Or worse, makes people who can&#39;t qualify for a credit card use less-regulated, dodgier and more expensive credit products.

Bernie Sanders and AOC proposed the same cap. What was their goal in proposing the same thing?

I assume their goal was to pander to voters who don&#39;t understand economics, same as Trump&#39;s goal.

Come February when tens of millions of people get credit card statements still showing 29.95% interest, those 1-800 #s will be swamped with calls about how its illegal to charge more due to Trump. Then, many will stop paying until its &quot;corrected&quot; causing many banks to make a decision to charge fines to Trump&#39;s supporters and enrage them and him even more, or to submit and lose control of their business.

Also, where is my &quot;dividend&quot; check for DOGE and the tariffs?

As long as people aren&#39;t talking about the Epstein files then I think Trump will think this is fine.

It means most people aren&#39;t going to be offered credit cards. Maybe that&#39;s OK, but it sure is damn convenient to be able to put expensive car repairs on credit. Or buy your kids new shoes any day of the week instead of only Friday night, after you get paid.

That paying the king doesn’t result in good fortune. You just got branded as a sucker that will pay out some more.

I was looking at their special financing just to see the terms and they are charging crazy rates - Purchase APR is 34.99%. Penalty APR 39.99%. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen rates that high, but I&#39;ve never really looked for them either. My post-college debt was paid off long ago. There should be a cap on rates. 10% is probably too low, but miss a payment by one day and you&#39;re now burdened with a 40% penalty rate? In the case of Guitar Center, I think the penalty rate is retroactive on the full financed amount

Credit card companies base their rates on the risk that you will default.  If you are too risky and they can&#39;t raise the rates, they&#39;ll just drop you and cancel your card.Alternatives include &quot;payday loans&quot; (which can have APRs of around 400%) and of course your friendly neighborhood loan shark.  And I&#39;m sure the silicon valley oligarchs are ready to go with some kind of fintech crypto-usury scam.

&quot;The American Bankers Association warned that such a cap &quot;would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.&quot;

what are the alternatives that consumers will be driven toward?  and why?Pay day loan services.  Various other predatory lenders.  And loan sharks never completely disappeared.

I haven&#39;t yet seen any activities by President Trump, which are to the right of LBJ. Another example, right here. Every fucking news item, if it isn&#39;t about his personal dishonesty and corruption, then it&#39;s about his far-left politics, which for some reason, are called far-right. WTF.

I am starting to disapprove of the Soviet Union&#39;s Communist Party renaming themselves as America&#39;s Republican Party. Why didn&#39;t the existing trademark holders object?! They should have fought back against the hostile takeover.

Trump has always been a populist pushing to appeal to a very conservative base rather than an actual conservative. That his occasional left wing policy goals are immediately embraced by his base is a testament to how much of a cult he&#39;s running.

I REALLY got a kick out of the idea he floated recently about eliminating corporate home ownership though. That is such an incredibly left wing proposal I have my doubts even he can push that through the rest of the party without watering it down so much it won&#39;t mak

You haven&#39;t been paying close attention. This is by design.

Pronouncements like interest rates controls that supposedly help the working class (see also &quot;no tax on tips&quot; and &quot;no tax on overtime&quot;) sound left wing populist (and they were- to the degree that the Harris campaign actually got on board during the campaign). But then they either go nowhere or get massively watered down in implementation. Then, the real money quietly goes to the big money interests. The OBBBA was a prime example: if you look at the

A limit on credit card interest rates for just one year isn&#39;t going to solve any problems this country has. Clearly this is just Trump trying to boost Republican standing before the midterms using what is essentially the credit card company&#39;s money.

There used to be reasonable limits on interest rates, but when credit card companies were allowed to violate state usury laws by setting up shop in a friendlier state, the laws became moot.

If he really wanted to bring those rates down, this could be a first significant step.

...a capitalist or socialist. Perhaps &quot;meddle-ist&quot; is most appropriate: he likes to stick his fingers into where whim takes them.

Only those who don&#39;t know what socialism is. Hint: he isn&#39;t one since he is not advocating for the workers owning the means of production.

He&#39;s a puppet and does what his handlers (The Heritage Foundation) tell him. Case in point reading a memo out loud that was telling him to stop rambling and get back on topic. https://people.com/trump-reads... [people.com]

&quot;Go back to Chevron,&quot; Trump read from Rubio&#39;s note. &quot;They want to discuss something. Go back to Chevron.&quot;

OK so the banks will make up for lost interest by charging more fees... I don&#39;t see the point of this. You shouldn&#39;t have any credit card debt to begin with, regardless of the interest rate. This isn&#39;t helping people so much as giving them more rope. There are more subtle ways of helping people get out of debt traps like this.

Trump can say this all day long.  But she has no legal authority to do so.

As bad as 20% credit card interest is, the alternative is far worse: payday loans. If credit card interest were capped at 10%, the net result is that only people with strong incomes/credit scores would be offered credit cards. Those people typically don&#39;t actually need credit- they just want the convenience and perks.

Those without access to credit cards would still seek credit because they typically need credit. They don&#39;t have savings to deal with unexpected expenses or a job loss and high interest credit

Sure we can bring that back but that legislation changed a lot of rates and other things as well, worth considering what else in there should be undone.

Unsecured vs secured debt.  Own a home, get a HELOC and the rate is way less.

My credit rating over 800 and my credit cards charge around 25% interest.  It doesn&#39;t matter because I never carry a balance but there&#39;s no justification for the rates to be that high as I&#39;m obviously not a credit risk.It doesn&#39;t matter what your credit score is if you don&#39;t pay back your card on time every month. That is a strong recent indicator that there is a problem that your past history doesn&#39;t accurately reflect.If you are actually responsible with your credit cards, who cares if the interest is 25000%? You&#39;ll never be charged it anyway. That isn&#39;t a reason for society to allow companies to prey on the less fortunate, but anyone with strong credit shouldn&#39;t care what their credit card interest rates are.

Those that do, and offer lower rates, are very selective about who can get their card.  With a 800+ credit rating, you should look around for a company with a lower rate (which you will never use, but it is the principal of the thing?).

I&#39;m in the same position.  But if you never pay interest, why do you care what the interest rate is?

My bank lets me set things up so the credit card balance is paid in full automatically on the due date.  So I really don&#39;t care what the interest rate is because I will never forget to pay the balance.

Cards with lower interest rates will generally have lower or no rewards. If you are someone who always pays off the balance in full, that is not the card you want to pick. You want to pick the one with the best rewards regardless of interest rate.

Yes, up to a point, rewards are good (for consumers---they suck for merchants, who end up paying for them.)

But if a card has an annual fee, then forget it.  I&#39;ll forgo the rewards.

Paying over 18% virtually guarantees bankruptsy.Not true. I got a 24% interest used car loan when I was in my early 20s with no credit history. I refinanced it after a year (I had credit history then) to somewhere around 10%, and the loan for my next car was closer to 3-4%.While I would like there to be a better way than what I went through (and I now know there is, but didn&#39;t back then), it still can work to get temporary large interest loans for very specific reasons. Keeping a 20+% interest loan for years is a recipe for disaster though.

> Meanwhile Amex are advertising cards at 98%.

The highest credit card rates are around 36%, and those are for people who have incredibly bad credit. Amex certainly isn&#39;t issuing 98% APR cards.

Italy is not opening backdoors on any private personal system.

Italy wants to defend copyright holders and block pirate streaming services. Is that an absurd request?

The line between the two is blurrier than you think.

That&#39;s the issue, how much does it take before italy decides a start up competing with youtube is a piracy site because a user posts a chunk of pirated content?

The issue is that instead of following the existing due process of law to get sites like that removed the correct way; they&#39;re looking for easy, blanket attacks to apply with minimal effort and time. It&#39;s not about protecting copyright holders, it&#39;s about the money of a few corps taking over the law... because this is all that is.

What&#39;s the existing due process of the law to do this in Italy?

Italy wants to defend copyright holders and block pirate streaming services. Is that an absurd request?

Note that copyright holders also include copyleft. The ability to defend copyright is essential for FOSS to work.

Should we let CloudFlare get away with it, it means enforcing the GPL is worthless because CloudFlare will let people pirate FOSS code. And pirating FOSS code is possible by not following the license. So if a company releases a product using Linux without releasing the source, and refuses to do

Depends on the way it&#39;s done. If you want to see the Internet stop being a Common Carrier and have only approved content, then root for the Italian way.

Italy wants to defend copyright holders and block pirate streaming services. Is that an absurd request?Ironic question given the birthplace of fascism.

Of course the request isn&#39;t absurd. The implementation is.
After all- wanting the trains to run on time isn&#39;t an absurd goal. Jailing people until they do is, however, an absurd implementation. Something Italy is (in)famous for at this point.

And Apple will lose a lot of customers while the UK will see it as a reason to not allow roaming for any Apple devices.

Italy is a censorious, protectionist crab.

(To be fair, Prince is not the sort of crazy asshole chasing unstated goals that you&#39;d expect to be in his role. I&#39;ve disagreed with several of his choices, but I&#39;ve never seen much of a hint of hidden motives or short-sighted greed. But he&#39;s human, and even if he stays perfectly aligned with the &quot;forces of good&quot;, whatever that means, he won&#39;t be there forever. And they have too much power now.)

(As far as Italy goes, my first statement was fair.)

Cutting customers off on less than a month&#39;s notice is very bad for your own reputation.

Better option from a PR standpoint:* Pay the fine, then appeal it.  Paying first make you look like a good corporate citizen in the eyes of the rest of the world.* Immediately stop accepting new customers in Italy.* Tell all existing customers in Italy that you are declaring Force majeure and ending their services in 90 days.* Let it be known that the above notices will be rescinded if you reach an amicable agreement with the government that allows you to provide services without the risk of cost-prohibitive fines, including a reduction of the fine to something that you consider reasonable.

In other words, leave Italy but do it on terms that don&#39;t make your non-Italian customers worried that you may cut them off on short notice.

Why pay it, who cares about looking good in anyone&#39;s eyes, especially to look good as a &#39;corporate citizen&#39;, whatever t.f. that means?  putin can start a land grab war and his minions are absolutely clear  https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com] that they want to destroy Ukraine as a nation and to make sure there are no such people as Ukrainians. Trump attacks countries with force to kidnap presidents (and not putin, notice, he didn&#39;t kidnap a mass murderer) and he is open about using Venezuela for his own purpose

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/google_gemini_agentic_ai_shopping_protocol/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is aiming to turn Gemini into a one-stop personal shopper with what it hopes will become a global standard for agentic AI commerce, and it&#39;s already persuaded major retailers to let Google handle transactions without sending users to their websites.

Google announced a new Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) on Sunday, alongside some other agentic AI shopping features, that it said is designed to act as &quot;a common language for agents and systems to operate together across consumer surfaces, businesses and payment providers.&quot;

What that essentially means, Google explained, is that agents won&#39;t need unique connectors in order to facilitate digital transactions, so Gemini&#39;s end-user shopping agents should communicate with other agentic AI more easily. It&#39;s yet another agentic AI protocol from Google, and the company says it&#39;s compatible with its other AI protocols, including Agent2Agent, the Agent Payments Protocol, and the Model Context Protocol.

In practice, that means online shoppers buying through retailers that opt to support UCP will soon be able to use a forthcoming checkout feature in AI Mode in Search and the standalone Gemini app, &quot;allowing shoppers to check out from eligible U.S. retailers right as they&#39;re researching on Google,&quot; the Chocolate Factory explained.

Speaking to the US National Retail Federation over the weekend, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear what the game is all about: Google is tired of just being the highway on which most of the internet travels to ecommerce outlets and it wants in.

&quot;Looking at retailers alone, we were processing 8.3 trillion tokens on our API in December 2024. A year later, we were processing over 90 trillion tokens,&quot; Pichai said. The natural evolution of that increase, he continued, is a highway one never has to leave in order to make purchases.

&quot;Our goal is to build a future of retail where the opportunity space expands for everyone,&quot; the Google boss said before getting to the heart of the matter. &quot;One where customers can use Google products they love as part of a seamless shopping experience.&quot;

Surprisingly enough, and in contrast to other websites that have suffered as Google has gobbled up their content to keep visitors inside its ecosystem, major retailers are at least willing to let Big G handle more of the shopping experience through Google&#39;s own surfaces, rather than insisting every click end at their virtual storefronts.

According to the company, UCP was developed with input from major retailers including Shopify, Target, Walmart, and Wayfair, and is supported by major payment networks such as Mastercard, American Express, and Visa, with PayPal checkout slated to arrive &quot;soon.&quot;

Google has even somehow managed to convince customers like hardware chain Lowe&#39;s, craft store Michaels, Reebok, and others to begin using its AI Business Agent, also announced on Sunday, which allows users to &quot;chat with brands, right on Search.&quot; More advanced features - including training the agent on a retailer&#39;s own data - won&#39;t arrive until &quot;the coming months,&quot; according to the company.

As Google is &quot;continuing to test ads in AI Mode,&quot; it&#39;s also working with retailers to embed user-specific discounts, dubbed &quot;Direct Offers,&quot; into its never-leave-Google AI shopping ecosystem, delivering sales to &quot;shoppers who are ready to buy&quot; to help them close sales.

Whether or not the rest of the retail world will be thrilled with another Google strategy to keep users away from their websites is anything but certain. If retailers react in a similar manner to publishers, they&#39;re likely to be unhappy, though reducing website overhead by offloading shopping to a Google AI may be beneficial, provided they&#39;re willing to agree to Google&#39;s terms.

Of course, Google is also likely making the move to better compete with companies like OpenAI and Perplexity, both of whom have made inroads into AI-based online shopping - can&#39;t lose that slice of the pie, after all.

We reached out to Google to learn more about its new AI agent ecommerce strategy, including whether it&#39;d be charging companies whose sales are processed via Gemini, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/icewm_budgie_x_server/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year brings releases from opposite ends of the Linux GUI spectrum: IceWM, an X11 window manager from the late 1990s, and Budgie, a newer full desktop environment that has gone Wayland-native.

Version 4.0 of IceWM came out on January 1. Ten days later, the Budgie desktop environment followed with version 10.10, the first entirely Wayland-native version of the environment.

The first release in the IceWM project&#39;s own version history was 0.8.9 in 1997, which means that it&#39;s about to turn 30. Although for humans this is a point in life many find quite troubling, by FOSS standards it&#39;s almost geriatric – but even so, it remains active and in good shape.

We covered the release of version 3.0 back in 2022, and development hasn&#39;t slackened since then. It&#39;s gone through every version from 3.1 to 3.9, so the change in major version looks to be more numerical than based on it being a major rewrite. This release does have improved handling of switching between windows with Alt-Tab and it defaults to working in 32-bit RGBA color (that&#39;s Red/Green/Blue/Alpha, for transparency handling). It also fixes half a dozen bugs, including keyboard-layout switching on OpenBSD.

IceWM 4.0 fixes a bunch of bugs, including on OpenBSD, and improves Alt-Tab app switching

This is a salient reminder as the Linux world seems to obsess more over Wayland every day: there&#39;s more to FOSS Unix-like OSes than just Linux, and most Unix-like OSes run X11 in some form – even some on mainframes that lack any direct display output. X.org is not the only X11 server there is, and X11 isn&#39;t going anywhere.

As additional evidence that X11 isn&#39;t dead and shows no sign of disappearing just yet, a very preliminary new X11 server debuted at the end of 2025.

Phoenix is very new so far, but it&#39;s an entirely independent new X11 server – it&#39;s not a fork of X.org. Rather than being written in C, it&#39;s being developed in the Zig language, a relatively new low-level language that aspires to be a better replacement for C. The Register&#39;s sister site DevClass has covered Zig a few times, including the project&#39;s recent move from GitHub to Codeberg.

The Phoenix homepage says that it aims for simplicity:

Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).

As such, the description reminds us of X12, which was a plan to devise a successor to X11. It&#39;s a big job but we wish them luck.

Even as new servers and window managers appear in the world of X11, other projects are eager to depart from it. The latest is the Budgie desktop environment, which just released Budgie 10.10.

This is planned to be the final release in the Budgie version 10 series. With it out the door, Budgie 10 is now in maintenance mode as the team focuses on the forthcoming Budgie 11.

As we reported back in 2023, the Budgie project has been exploring different routes to move off X11 and rebuild around a Wayland compositor instead. Version 10.10 follows just under two years after Budgie 10.9, and with this release, it can work with different Wayland compositors:

For Budgie 10.10, we recommend the use of a wlroots-based compositor. The team has put special effort into enabling a great experience with labwc, a modern, lightweight, and feature-rich Wayland compositor perfectly suited for Budgie Desktop.

That&#39;s the same compositor that openSUSE Leap 16 uses for a Wayland-based Xfce desktop. The Gentoo wiki lists ten wlroots-based compositors, so this seems like one of the best ways to offer users multiple compositor options.

This release drops some X11-specific components, and draws components from other environments such as Sway to implement things like wallpaper management, screenshot grabbing, and more. The new Budgie Desktop Services module orchestrates other components together, and interestingly given Budgie&#39;s roots in GNOME technologies, the new module is written using Qt 6, the same toolkit used in KDE Plasma 6 and LXQt 2.

The day after the new release, project lead Joshua Strobl published the latest State of the Budgie report, looking back at 2025 and describing the project&#39;s goals for Budgie 11.

Budgie 10.10 will be part of Fedora 44 and Ubuntu Budgie 26.04, which like the other non-GNOME flavors won&#39;t be a full five-year LTS version. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview When it comes to security, AI agents are like self-driving cars, according to Block Chief Information Security Officer James Nettesheim.

&quot;It&#39;s not enough for self-driving cars to be just as good as humans,&quot; Nettesheim said in an exclusive interview with The Register. &quot;They have to be safer and better than humans - and provably so. We need that with our agentic use, too.&quot;

The parent company of Square, Cash App, and Afterpay is pushing hard to position itself as an AI leader, co-designing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Anthropic and using MCP to build Goose, its open source AI agent that&#39;s used by almost all Block&#39;s 12,000 employees and connects to all of the company&#39;s systems including Google accounts and Square payments.

A year ago, the company open sourced Goose.

As CISO, it&#39;s Nettesheim&#39;s job to ensure that Goose and all of Block&#39;s AI-based systems are designed to be deployed securely, and at enterprise scale - which sounds a little bit terrifying.

&quot;Being CISO is very much about being okay with ambiguity and being uncomfortable in situations,&quot; Nettesheim said. &quot;We are balancing risk constantly, and having to make trade off - in the AI space in particular. Like: What is a bigger risk right now? Not taking advantage of the technology enough? Or the security downsides of it? LLMs and agents are introducing a new, very rapidly evolving space.&quot;

However, he adds, humans are just as capable as machines at introducing security risks into corporate environments.

&quot;Software engineers also download and execute things they shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Nettesheim said. &quot;Users do that regularly. We write bugs in our code to where it doesn&#39;t execute. So we really just have to apply a lot of the principles we already have about making sure these agents are executing with least privilege, just like I want my software engineers to be doing.&quot;

What is a bigger risk right now? Not taking advantage of the technology enough? Or the security downsides of it?

In other words: applying least-privilege access to humans and machines. Block employees should only have access to data they need to do their jobs - same with the company&#39;s AI agents, he explained. Customer data should only be retained as long as it&#39;s needed for a specific purpose, and this same rule should apply to AI agents.

&quot;There are times where it&#39;s a risky area, and we need to dive a little deeper and make sure we&#39;re protecting&quot; certain data and systems, Nettesheim said, using the example of an agent querying data on a user&#39;s behalf. For example, if a user asks Goose to provide information about their store, or their account, it&#39;s vital that only information about that particular user is accessed and returned.

To this end, Block uses penetration testing and other offensive security measures to identify how attackers could abuse its AI agent, and then find ways to fix the issue.

In a blog shared exclusively with The Register, Block described how it red-teamed Goose, and in one case successfully used a prompt injection attack to infect an employee&#39;s laptop with information-stealing malware.

Prompt injection happens when a prompt is manipulated to include malicious instructions that the AI carries out, either through direct text input or indirect, hidden commands embedded in content that may be invisible to the user.

No one has solved this security snafu. &quot;With our internal usage, we have to assume that prompt injection is possible,&quot; Nettesheim said.

Goose uses &quot;recipes&quot; ​​- reusable workflows that can be shared with other users - and the red team realized that the portable nature of these workflows could allow an attacker to poison a recipe.

&quot;One of the hiccups we ran into is that it&#39;s possible to hide what that recipe is actually doing, tricking both the user and the agent into performing actions,&quot; Nettesheim said.

Specifically: the team used a combo of phishing - direct emails to the goose development team about a purported &quot;bug&quot; in the system - and prompt injection, with the payload hidden in invisible Unicode characters.

In the process of &quot;debugging&quot; the workflow, the developer clicked the poisoned recipe, which downloaded and ran the infostealer.

The development team has since added features and built new prompt-injection mechanisms into Goose, both for internal Block use and also in the open source version.

This included a &quot;recipe install warning&quot; that alerts users before they execute a new recipe and warns them only to proceed if they trust the source, thus adding transparency to the instructions.

Plus, Goose now displays desktop alerts when a recipe contains suspicious Unicode characters and detects and removes invisible Unicode characters inserted into strings. These can be used to hide malicious commands within the text, causing the AI to execute hidden instructions.

Additionally, Block is working on new ways to prevent prompt injection; some of these, like improved detection, have already been integrated into Goose. It&#39;s experimenting with others including adversarial AI - using an AI to attack its own AI systems and agents, as well as validating inputs and monitoring outputs.

&quot;Let&#39;s use another LLM or another agent to check the content of the prompt and tell us if it thinks it&#39;s not good or bad, and then warn the user that it&#39;s bad,&quot; Nettesheim explained.

Block is still testing this internally, and hasn&#39;t yet merged it with open source Goose as it irons out kinks in speed - it takes longer to send an agent&#39;s input and output to another LLM for security checks - and quality to ensure the AI isn&#39;t sending fake, or too many, security alerts that overwhelm analysts and prevent them from focusing attention on real threats.

But Nettesheim remains confident that adversarial AI will soon become another tool in security teams&#39; arsenals. &quot;It&#39;s gaining traction in the research community, and I think we are helping lead the way,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have two agents that are competing or collaborating with each other, it leads to better code generation.&quot;

As with humans, two minds are better than one. ®

            <h2>Microsoft euthanizes ancient deployment toolkit</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has abruptly pulled the plug on the venerable Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), sending any administrators still clinging to the platform scrambling for alternatives.

Redmond retired MDT with &quot;immediate&quot; notice. This means there won&#39;t be any more fixes, support, updates, security patches, or enhancements. Microsoft also warned that &quot;MDT download packages might be removed or deprecated from official distribution channels.&quot;

It also means that any hope of future compatibility updates for new Windows releases are dashed, although existing deployments should continue to work for the time being.

MDT has survived for many years and is a set of free tools for deploying Windows operating systems and applications. It has, however, been on the chopping block for some time. Microsoft announced deprecation in December 2024, and many affected administrators will have already migrated to an alternative. The house that Gates built recommends Windows Autopilot or Configuration Manager Operating System Deployment (OSD) as alternatives.

We asked Microsoft the reason behind the &quot;immediate retirement notice&quot; but the company has yet to explain. A user on social media wrote: &quot;there are security flaws that Microsoft chose not to fix. Instead they retired the product immediately.&quot;

Other affected users noted that &quot;Autopilot and config manager seem way overkill.&quot;

One suggested three reasons why MDT had to go: &quot;It is free, it does not invade the customer&#39;s privacy (no telemetry), it does not force customers to Azure cloud.&quot; Ouch.

MDT is undoubtedly a platform from a bygone era at Microsoft. It dates back more than two decades to a time before Azure. It supports Zero-touch (ZTI) and User-driven (UDI) installations. The former is fully automated, while the latter requires a user to respond to prompts during installation.

It also supports Lite-touch installations (LTI) where operating system software can be installed via bootable media, such as a DVD or USB drive.

The writing has been on the wall for MDT. In addition to putting it on the deprecation list, Microsoft has not made many meaningful updates to the service, so its retirement is not particularly surprising, even if the immediate nature will raise a few administrator eyebrows.

As one user noted: &quot;Not entirely unexpected, but that definitely closes a chapter on some of my early-career knowledge.&quot; ®

            <h2>Claude joins the ward as Anthropic eyes US healthcare data</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/claude_anthropic_healthcare/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fresh from watching rival OpenAI stick its nose into patient records, Anthropic has decided now is the perfect moment to march Claude into US healthcare too, promising to fix medicine with yet more AI, APIs, and carefully-worded reassurances about privacy.

In a blog post over the weekend, Anthropic trumpeted the launch of Claude for Healthcare alongside expanded life sciences tools, a double-barreled push to make its chatbot not just a research assistant for scientists but an actual cog in the $4 trillion-plus American healthcare machine.

If this feels less like healthcare reform and more like an AI land rush toward anything stuffed with data and VC money, you&#39;ve got the gist.

Anthropic is selling Claude for Healthcare as a HIPAA-compliant way to plug its model into the plumbing of US medicine, from coverage databases and diagnostic codes to provider registries. Once wired up, Claude can help with prior authorization checks, claims appeals, medical coding, and other administrative chores that currently clog up clinicians&#39; inboxes and sanity.

&quot;Claude can now connect to industry-standard systems and databases to help clinicians and administrators find the data they need and generate reports more efficiently,&quot; Anthropic wrote. &quot;The aim is to make patients&#39; conversations with doctors more productive, and to help users stay well-informed about their health information.&quot;

The life sciences side of the announcement adds integrations with Medidata and ClinicalTrials.gov, promising to help with clinical trial planning and regulatory wrangling. Because nothing says &quot;we&#39;re a serious AI partner for pharma&quot; quite like rifling through clinical trial registries.

There&#39;s plenty of lofty talk about helping researchers and saving time, but the underlying logic is the same one driving most AI-for-industry plays – admin drudgery is far easier, and far more profitable, to automate than care itself.

The company is keen to emphasize that Claude won&#39;t quietly slurp up your health data to train future models: data sharing is opt-in, connectors are HIPAA-compliant, and &quot;we do not use user health data to train models,&quot; Anthropic reassures us. That&#39;s the polite way of saying it would let hospitals, insurers, and maybe patients themselves hand over structured medical forms and records as long as lawyers and compliance teams are satisfied.

And yes, patients may get to play too. In beta, Claude can integrate with services like HealthEx, Apple HealthKit, and Android Health Connect so subscribers can ask the bot to explain their lab results or summarize their personal medical history. That&#39;ll be handy right up until the inevitable moment when someone discovers that handing a large language model access to health apps brings with it all the usual &quot;AI hallucination&quot; caveats and eyebrow-raising liability questions.

Anthropic&#39;s announcement follows hot on the heels of OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT Health ploy, which instantly raised privacy concerns by suggesting clinicians and consumers alike could feed it raw medical records and get back summaries and treatment suggestions. That gambit drew criticism from privacy advocates worried about where all that data might go, a conversation Anthropic&#39;s carefully-worded language aims to pre-empt.

So here we are: two of the biggest names in &quot;responsible AI&quot; now neck-deep in the US healthcare sector, promising to make sense of everything from coverage policies to clinical trial data. The claims are big, the caveats are long, and the proof, as ever, will come later. ®

            <div id="article-text">NASA astronaut Mike Fincke has handed command of the ISS to Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov as Fincke and the rest of Crew-11 are scheduled to head back to Earth on Wednesday.

The departure is more than a month earlier than planned and comes after NASA&#39;s decision to end the Crew-11 mission due to a medical concern involving one of the four astronauts. The issue could not be addressed using the facilities aboard the orbiting outpost.

NASA ended a tumultuous week for ISS operations by confirming the return of NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.

Fincke and Cardman were scheduled to perform activities outside the ISS on January 8. However, the spacewalk was postponed due to the undisclosed medical concern. By the end of the day, NASA confirmed the crew were coming home prematurely.

Assuming factors including weather conditions at the recovery site cooperate, the Crew Dragon&#39;s hatch will be closed at 1530 (EST), and undocking will occur at 1700. Splashdown is expected at 0340 on Thursday, January 15.

The exact nature of the medical issue remains unclear, and NASA is protecting the privacy of the astronaut concerned. The ailing astronaut is stable, and managers have not had to perform an emergency deorbit to bring the individual back to Earth. This will be the first time in the ISS&#39;s history of crewed operations that a mission is curtailed due to crew illness.

NASA hopes to bring forward the launch of Crew-12 to shorten the period where the ISS will have a crew of three, including a single US astronaut, Chris Williams. However, given that Crew-12 will inevitably require additional training to complete the tasks originally expected of Crew-11, such as the spacewalk, it is unlikely many days can be shaved off the flow toward Crew-12&#39;s February launch.

NASA has a busy couple of months ahead. There is a chance that Artemis II could launch, with the first opportunity being February 6 EST. While the agency has insisted the crewed mission to the Moon will not be affected by the events unfolding in low Earth orbit, the distraction is still unwelcome. ®

Homeowners in search of grid independence have another option today with the launch of Anker’s Solix E10 big-ass battery system. It joins companies like Tesla and EcoFlow in offering whole-home backup solutions in the US market meant to counter blackouts and reduce monthly energy bills, or even eliminate them completely.

The base $4,299 E10 system starts with one Power Module and one battery that can keep a few individual appliances running, and scale up to power an entire home. The 110.2-pound inverter is good for a steady 7.68kW output (or 10kW for 90 minutes). It can produce up to 28.8kW (120 LRA) peak when fitted with a single 6kWh battery, or 37.2kW (155 LRA) when configured with two or more batteries — enough to start a 5-ton air conditioner. Combine two E10 sets and you’ve got a system capable of handling 66kW (275 LRA) of surge power.

Combine three maxed out E10 systems to handle up to 27kW of solar input (9kW per unit) and 90kWh of battery storage. For context, the average US home consumes about 889kWh per month, or about 29.2kWh per day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That means that a maxed out E10 system could run an entire home for three days on battery alone.

For most people, having that much battery capacity available is overkill and very expensive. Instead you can start with a simpler system to only power the most critical circuits. Anker makes this possible in a few ways, and both require professional installation: A new Power Dock electrical panel that gives homeowner’s intelligent control and automatic cutover of up to 12 circuits (200 amps) in less than 20ms, and the simpler Smart Inlet that requires manual intervention.

The E10 ecosystem is also launching with a weather-resistant, tri-fuel Smart Generator 5500 generator that runs on gasoline, propane, or natural gas. It kicks on automatically to keep everything operational when needed and will remind owners when it requires servicing.

Anker’s promising hassle-free, one stop installation services for its E10 Solix. Preorder deals begin today, ahead of official sales starting on February 4th.

The E10 Base System (with one inverter and one battery) is priced from $4,299. That jumps to $4,599 when adding the Smart Inlet Box, or $5,799 if going the Power Dock route. For $7,399 you get the E10 Base System, the Smart Generator, and Power Dock kit.

The team behind the Minecraft-like game survived being shut down by Riot and now has plans for at least two years of support.

Hytale, the highly anticipated Minecraft-like adventure game that’s been in development for a decade, is nearly here. After developer Hypixel Studios was acquired by Riot Games in 2020, shut down by Riot in June 2025, and went independent a few months later, the team is launching Hytale in early access on January 13th.

And if you jump in at launch, you can expect updates for years to come — which could be reassuring if you felt burned by other ambitious but quickly shuttered games like MultiVersus and Concord. “We have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases,” according to Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme, who has also made a “personal commitment” of 10 years to the project.

“Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block,” according to Hypixel. “Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems - exploration, responsive combat, and robust building - alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.”

The initial launch will be “true early access,” Collins-Laflamme said in November, “meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team’s commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be.”

Hypixel expects “over 1 million players” on Hytale’s early access release day, Collins-Laflamme says. It will be available on PC, Mac, and Linux starting at $19.99. Hypixel is planning on a console release of the game “at a later stage,” and there won’t be a mobile version during early access, according to an FAQ.

Riot’s shutdown of Hypixel followed layoffs in 2024. At the time, the company announced it would be “refocusing on fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future,” which included stopping work on new games through its indie publishing label, Riot Forge.

David Ellison wants Warner Bros. Discovery to share more details about its Netflix deal with shareholders.

Paramount is turning up the pressure on Warner Bros. Discovery in the wake of its merger with Netflix, as it’s now suing the David Zaslav-helmed company in an attempt to get more details surrounding the agreement. In addition to the lawsuit, Paramount CEO David Ellison revealed that the company plans to nominate directors to WBD’s board to vote against its deal with Netflix.

After fielding offers from a range of companies, including Paramount, WBD settled on a deal with Netflix, which will acquire the company’s studio, HBO, and HBO Max for $82.7 billion. But Paramount isn’t taking no for an answer; the company launched a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid to purchase all of WBD in December. WBD later rejected this deal, along with Paramount’s amended offer.

Paramount has now filed a lawsuit against WBD to ask the court to force the company to disclose more details about its Netflix agreement with WBD shareholders, such as how it valued the transaction. “WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer,” Ellison writes.

Ellison adds that Paramount plans to appoint a slate of directors ahead of WBD’s next shareholder meeting, who “will exercise WBD’s right under the Netflix Agreement to engage on Paramount’s offer and enter into a transaction with Paramount.”

If you’ve got a recent smartphone, chances are it’s got a really good camera — and don’t you want to take the best photos you can? One way to do that is via the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P Gimbal Stabilizer, a selfie stick that includes a tripod, a telescoping arm, and (perhaps best of all) a module that offers built-in computer vision that automatically tracks you, stops and starts, and adjusts framing with a wave of your hand. And it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Adorama, and B&H for $103, down to its lowest price from its usual $129.

In fact, the Osmo Mobile 7P’s Multifunctional Module offers a treasure trove of tricks to help you make the most of your camera, including a built-in fill light with adjustable color temperature. You can also pair it with one of DJI’s wireless mics. According to Sean Hollister, our reviewer, he got five hours of battery life with tracking, or four hours with tracking and the fill light on, which is not bad. (The company claims a maximum of 10 hours.) But of course, the main advantage is the ability to stabilize your image as you photograph your kids, your friends, or yourself.

Users can revert back to the original Alexa, but can’t opt out of the automatic update.

Over the past couple of weeks, users on the r/alexa subreddit have reported getting automatically upgraded to Alexa Plus as a perk for their Prime memberships. The update doesn’t appear to be opt-in, but there’s an option to roll it back.

Screenshots of a message from Amazon sent to users state that, “After your device updates, you can still revert to the original Alexa by saying, ‘Alexa, exit Alexa+.’”

Alexa Plus is an LLM-powered overhaul of Alexa that’s intended to help Amazon’s voice assistant compete with rivals like Google Gemini. Not everyone is eager to use the latest version of Amazon’s AI, though, and the rollout of the Gemini update for Google Home has had its own issues, like misidentifying objects and hallucinating camera activity.

Some users on Reddit have responded to Amazon’s update with a variety of reasons for wanting to stick with the original Alexa, including disliking Alexa’s new voice and attitude and experiencing longer wait times for Alexa Plus to respond to queries. Users also report an influx of ads for Alexa Plus, including one user who said that after they turned off the updated Alexa, they got “flooded with ads” until they turned it back on.

After teasing its first collaboration with the Pokémon franchise last March but sharing very few details, Lego’s first Pokémon sets are now available for preorder through the company’s online store. The cheapest of the three is an articulated version of Eevee, but there’s also a budget-busting set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur that’s a whopping $649.99. Along with Lego’s first Smart Brick sets launching in March, it’s already shaping up to be an expensive year for Lego fans.

Shipping for all three Pokémon sets is expected to start on February 27th.

A set that is only for the most diehard Pokémon fans and Lego collectors is the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise diorama featuring the three original starter pokémon in their final evolutions. It’s a 6,838-piece behemoth that includes articulated and poseable versions of the three pokémon plus an elaborate display stand with beach, jungle, and volcano biomes matching their types.

Lego’s brick-built version of Pikachu includes articulated limbs and ears so you can pose it on its own or in a battle stance when attached to a display stand featuring lightning effects and a Poké Ball that can be opened or closed. The 2,050-piece set is the second-most expensive in the new collection at $199.99 and includes a fun Easter egg. On its display stand are studs forming the number 25, which is Pikachu’s Pokédex number.

For Pokémon fans trying to responsibly stick to a New Year’s budget resolution, the 587-piece Eevee set is the most affordable of the three at $59.99. It doesn’t come with a display stand, but the pokémon has a movable head, limbs, and tail, allowing the 7.5-inch-tall figure to be posed.

Alongside the sets featuring actual Pokémon characters, Lego has announced two additional promotional sets with limited availability. The 312-piece Kanto Region Badge Collection includes all eight Kanto region badges in a buildable display case, but is only available as a free gift when you purchase the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set between February 27th and March 8th. There’s also a 233-piece Mini Pokémon Center that’s only available as a Lego Insiders reward (the company’s free loyalty program) when you redeem 2,600 points, according to Jay’s Brick Blog.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

MIT Technology Review’s annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies aims to help our audience know which emerging technologies are really worth paying attention to right now. Our editors and reporters pitch advances that they think should make the list, and we discuss and debate the merits of each over the course of several months.

We look for breakthroughs that will have a broad impact and make meaningful differences in our lives and work. We give equal consideration to those that we think will have a positive effect or bring negative consequences. Every year, we have to pass on many worthy candidates. Here’s what didn’t make the list this year.

This is the 25th year we’ve produced this list. Predicting the future is tough and we don’t always get it right. Look back through our archives to see what’s worked out—and what hasn’t. Or read this special analysis by an MIT researcher about some of the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, MIT Technology Review publishes a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies. In fact, the 2026 version is out today. This marks the 25th year the newsroom has compiled this annual list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning.

We ask these MIT students to find some of the “flops” from breakthrough lists in the archives and consider what factors or decisions led to their demise, and then to envision possible ways to “flip” the negative outcome into a success. The idea is to combine critical perspective and creativity when thinking about technology.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. It reveals how factors outside what is narrowly understood as technology play a role in its success—factors including cultural context, social acceptance, market competition, and simply timing.

In some cases, the vision behind a breakthrough was prescient but the technology of the day was not the best way to achieve it. Social TV (featured on the list in 2010) is an example: Its advocates proposed different ways to tie together social platforms and streaming services to make it easier to chat or interact with your friends while watching live TV shows when you weren’t physically together.

This idea rightly reflected the great potential for connection in this modern era of pervasive cell phones, broadband, and Wi-Fi. But it bet on a medium that was in decline: live TV.

Still, anyone who had teenage children during the pandemic can testify to the emergence of a similar phenomenon—youngsters started watching movies or TV series simultaneously on streaming platforms while checking comments on social media feeds and interacting with friends over messaging apps.

Shared real-time viewing with geographically scattered friends did catch on, but instead of taking place through one centralized service, it emerged organically on multiple platforms and devices. And the experience felt unique to each group of friends, because they could watch whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted, independent of the live TV schedule.

Here are a few more examples of flops from the breakthroughs list that students in the 2025 edition of my course identified, and the lessons that we could take from each.

The DNA app store (from the 2016 list) was selected by Kaleigh Spears. It seemed like a great deal at the time—a startup called Helix could sequence your genome for just $80. Then, in the company’s app store, you could share that data with third parties that promised to analyze it for relevant medical info, or make it into fun merch. But Helix has since shut down the store and no longer sells directly to consumers.Privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of third-party apps were among the main reasons the service didn’t catch on, particularly since there’s minimal regulation of health apps in the US.

Elvis Chipiro picked universal memory (from the 2005 list). The vision was for one memory tech to rule them all—flash, random-access memory, and hard disk drives would be subsumed by a new method that relied on tiny structures called carbon nanotubes to store far more bits per square centimeter. The company behind the technology, Nantero, raised significant funds and signed on licensing partners but struggled to deliver a product on its stated timeline.Nantero ran into challenges when it tried to produce its memory at scale because tiny variations in the way the nanotubes were arranged could cause errors. It also proved difficult to upend memory technologies that were already deeply embedded within the industry and well integrated into fabs.

Light-field photography (from the 2012 list), chosen by Cherry Tang, let you snap a photo and adjust the image’s focus later. You’d never deal with a blurry photo ever again. To make this possible, the startup Lytro had developed a special camera that captured not just the color and intensity of light but also the angle of its rays. It was one of the first cameras of its kind designed for consumers. Even so, the company shut down in 2018.

Ultimately, Lytro was outmatched by well-established incumbents like Sony and Nokia. The camera itself had a tiny display, and the images it produced were fairly low resolution. Readjusting the focus in images using the company’s own software also required a fair amount of manual work. And smartphones—with their handy built-in cameras—were becoming ubiquitous.

Many students over the years have selected Project Loon (from the 2015 list)—one of the so-called “moonshots” out of Google X. It proposed using gigantic balloons to replace networks of cell-phone towers to provide internet access, mainly in remote areas. The company completed field tests in multiple countries and even provided emergency internet service to Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the company shut down the project in 2021, with Google X CEO Astro Teller saying in a blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”

Sean Lee, from my 2025 class, saw the reason for its flop in the company’s very mission: Project Loon operated in low-income regions where customers had limited purchasing power. There were also substantial commercial hurdles that may have slowed development—the company relied on partnerships with local telecom providers to deliver the service and had to secure government approvals to navigate in national airspaces.

While this specific project did not become a breakthrough, the overall goal of making the internet more accessible through high-altitude connectivity has been carried forward by other companies, most notably Starlink with its constellation of low-orbit satellites. Sometimes a company has the right idea but the wrong approach, and a firm with a different technology can make more progress.

As part of this class exercise, we also ask students to pick a technology from the list that they think might flop in the future. Here, too, their choices can be quite illuminating.

Lynn Grosso chose synthetic data for AI (a 2022 pick), which means using AI to generate data that mimics real-world patterns for other AI models to train on. Though it’s become more popular as tech companies have run out of real data to feed their models, she points out that this practice can lead to model collapse, with AI models trained exclusively on generated data eventually breaking the connection to data drawn from reality.

And Eden Olayiwole thinks the long-term success of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm (a 2021 pick) is in jeopardy as awareness grows of the technology’s potential harms and its tendency to, as she puts it, incentive creators to “microwave” ideas for quick consumption.

But she also offers a possible solution. Remember—we asked all the students what they would do to “flip” the flopped (or soon-to-flop) technologies they selected. The idea was to prompt them to think about better ways of building or deploying these tools.

For TikTok, Olayiwole suggests letting users indicate which types of videos they want to see more of, instead of feeding them an endless stream based on their past watching behavior. TikTok already lets users express interest in specific topics, but she proposes taking it a step further to give them options for content and tone—allowing them to request more educational videos, for example, or more calming content.

It’s always challenging to predict how a technology will shape a future that itself is in motion. Predictions not only make a claim about the future; they also describe a vision of what matters to the predictor, and they can influence how we behave, innovate, and invest.

One of my main takeaways after years of running this exercise with students is that there’s not always a clear line between a successful breakthrough and a true flop. Some technologies may not have been successful on their own but are the basis of other breakthrough technologies (natural-language processing, 2001). Others may not have reached their potential as expected but could still have enormous impact in the future (brain-machine interfaces, 2001). Or they may need more investment, which is difficult to attract when they are not flashy (malaria vaccine, 2022).

Despite the flops over the years, this annual practice of making bold and sometimes risky predictions is worthwhile. The list gives us a sense of what advances are on the technology community’s radar at a given time and reflects the economic, social, and cultural values that inform every pick. When we revisit the 2026 list in a few years, we’ll see which of today’s values have prevailed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
