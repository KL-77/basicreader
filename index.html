This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we’ve got a bit of everything: period dramas (The Gilded Age, Outrageous), superheroes (Daredevil: Born Again), mysteries (Ludwig, Poker Face, Dept. Q), political thrillers (The Diplomats, Slow Horses), science fiction (Andor, Severance, Alien: Earth), broody fantasy (The Sandman), and even an unconventional nature documentary (Underdogs).

As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.

Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it’s a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). Underdogs takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature’s less cool and majestic creatures—the outcasts and benchwarmers more noteworthy for their “unconventional hygiene choices” and “unsavory courtship rituals.” (It’s rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.)

Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. “Superheroes” highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; “Sexy Beasts” focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; “Terrible Parents” highlights nature’s worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; “Total Grossout” is exactly what it sounds like; and “The Unusual Suspects” is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded a special theme song for the opening credits.

While Reynolds mostly followed the script (which his team helped write), there was also a fair amount of improvisation—not all of it PG-13. The producers couldn’t use the racier ad-libs. But some made it into the final episodes, like Reynolds describing an aye-aye as “if fear and panic had a baby and rolled it in dog hair.” We also meet the velvet worm, which creeps up on unsuspecting prey before squirting disgusting slime all over their food, and the pearl fish, which hides from predators in a sea cucumber’s butt, among other lowly yet fascinating critters. Verdict: Underdogs is positively addictive. It’s my favorite nature documentary ever.

Dep. Q is a rare show that commits to old tropes—an unlikable but smart central character revisits cold cases—and somehow manages to repackage them in a way that feels distinctive. To get a sense of the show, you only have to describe its precise genre. You might call it a murder mystery, and there are murders in it, but one of the mysteries is whether a key player is alive or not, given that a lot of her story takes place in flashbacks with an uncertain relationship to the present. It’s almost a police procedural, except that many of the police are only following procedures grudgingly and erratically. It’s not really a whodunnit, given that you only end up learning who done some of it by the time the first season wraps up. And so on.

Amid all the genre fluidity, the show does a great job of balancing the key challenge of a mystery program: telling you enough that you can make reasonably informed guesses on at least some of what’s going on without giving the whole game away and making it easy to figure out all the details. And the acting is superb. Matthew Goode does a nice job of handling the central character’s recent trauma while helping you understand why he has a few loyal co-workers despite the fact that he was probably unlikable even before he was traumatized. And Alexej Manvelov (who I’d never seen before) is fantastic as a former Syrian policeman who drops occasional hints that he had been an active participant in that country’s police state.

There are definitely quibbles. The creation of a cold case squad happens on the flimsiest of motivations, and the fantastic Kelly Macdonald is badly underused. But the show is definitely good enough that I’m curious about some additional mysteries: Can the team behind it continue to avoid getting bogged down in the tropes in season two, and which of the many threads it left unresolved will be picked up when they try?

Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel’s revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D’Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season.

Granted, there were some rough spots. The entire season was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, and at times it felt like two very different shows. A weird serial killer subplot was primarily just distracting. There was also the controversial decision to kill off a major character from the original Netflix series in the first episode. But that creative choice cleared the decks to place the focus squarely on Matt’s and Fisk’s parallel arcs, and the two central actors do not disappoint.

Matt decides to focus on his legal work while Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, intent on leaving his criminal life behind. But each struggles to remain in the light as the dark sides of their respective natures fight to be released. The result is an entertaining, character-driven series that feels very much a part of its predecessor while still having its own distinctive feel.

I confess I might have missed Boots had it not been singled out and dismissed as “woke garbage” by the Pentagon—thereby doubling the show’s viewership. I was pleased to discover that it’s actually a moving, often thought-provoking dramedy that humanizes all the young men from many different backgrounds who volunteer to serve their country in the US military. The show is based on a memoir (The Pink Marine) by Greg Cope White about his experiences as a gay teen in the military in the 1980s when gay and bisexual people weren’t allowed to serve. Boots is set in the early 1990s just before the onset of the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” era.

Miles Heizer stars as Cameron Cope (Cope White’s fictional alter ego), a closeted gay teen in Louisiana who signs up as a recruit for the US Marine Corps with his best (straight) friend Ray (Liam Oh). He’s not the most promising recruit, but over the course of eight episodes, we see him struggle, fail, pick himself back up, and try again during the grueling boot camp experience, forming strong bonds with his fellow recruits but all the while terrified of being outed and kicked out.

Heizer gives a powerful performance as Cameron, enhanced by the contrast with Max Parker’s stellar portrayal of the tightly wound Sergeant Liam Robert Sullivan—a decorated Marine inexplicably reassigned to train recruits while harboring his own secrets. Nor is Miles’ story the only focus: We learn more about several characters and their private struggles, and those inter-relationships are the heart and soul of the show. Netflix canceled the series, but this one season stands tall on its own.

This charming Emmy-nominated comedy series has made our “Best of TV” list every season, and 2025 is no exception. Only Murders in the Building (OMITB) stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, all residents of the same Manhattan apartment complex, the Arconia. The unlikely trio teams up to launch their own true crime podcast whenever someone dies in the building under suspicious circumstances, chronicling their independent investigation to solve the murder. There’s no shortage of podcast fodder, as this single building has a shockingly high murder rate.

S5 focused on the death of the building’s doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), found floating in the Arcadia’s fountain in the season finale. The discovery of a severed finger leads our team to conclude that Lester was murdered. Their quest involves a trio of billionaires, the mayor (Keegan-Michael Key), a missing mafioso (Bobby Cannavale) and his widow (Tea Leoni), and maybe even the building’s new robotic assistant, LESTR (voiced by Paul Rudd). As always, the season finale sets up next season’s murder: that of rival podcaster Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), who lives just long enough to reach the Arcadia’s gates and place one hand into the courtyard—technically dying “in the building.” One assumes that OMITB will eventually run out of fresh takes on its clever concept, but it certainly hasn’t done so yet.

I unequivocally loved the first season of The Sandman, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s influential graphic novel series (of which I am a longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming. It was a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream’s story to its inevitably tragic yet satisfying end.

As always, the casting is extraordinary and the performances are note-perfect across the board. And Netflix did not skimp on the visuals, which bring the graphic novel imagery to vivid life. I still appreciate how the leisurely pacing lets the viewer relax and sink into this richly layered fictional world. Part I kicked off with an Endless family reunion that led Dream into revisiting Hell and agreeing to his sister Delirium’s request to look for their absent brother, Destruction. That sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the tragedy that unfolds in Part II. The bonus episode, in which Death gets one day (every hundred years) to be human—an adaptation of the standalone Death: The High Cost of Living—serves as a lovely coda to this unique series, which is pretty much everything I could have wanted in an adaptation.

Ludwig is a clever twist on the British cozy mystery genre. David Mitchell stars as John Taylor, a reclusive eccentric who creates puzzles for a living under the pseudonym “Ludwig.” When his identical twin brother, Cambridge DCI James Taylor (also Mitchell), goes missing, his sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) convinces John to go undercover. John reluctantly pretends to be James to gain access to the police department in hopes of finding out what happened to his twin. He inevitably gets drawn into working on cases—and turns out to be exceptionally good at applying his puzzle skills to solve murders, even as his anxiety grows about his subterfuge being discovered.

The best crime shows deftly balance cases-of-the-week with longer character-driven story arcs, and Ludwig achieves that balance beautifully. The writers brought in a puzzle consultant to create the various crosswords that appear in the series, as well as a special cryptic crossword done in character as Ludwig that appeared in The Guardian. The first season ended with a bit of a cliffhanger about what’s really been going on with James, but fortunately, the BBC has renewed Ludwig for a second season, so we’ll get to see more of our cryptic crime-solver.

Poker Face is perfect comfort TV, evolving the case-of-the-week format that made enduring early TV hits like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote iconic. The second season takes the endlessly likeable BS-detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) to the end of the road after she overcomes fleeing the mob in her 1969 Plymouth Barracuda. Along the way, Charlie pals around with A-list guest stars and solves crimes, winding her way from Florida to New York as each delightful new caper serves not to ramp up tension but to disrupt how viewers anticipate Charlie will move. Some might think that the lack of tension made the season weaker. But creator Rian Johnson recently revealed that he expects Poker Face to cast a new lead detective every two years. That makes it seem clear that Charlie’s second season was more about release.

In the most memorable episode of the season, “Sloppy Joseph,” the front row of an elementary school talent show suddenly becomes a bloody splash zone when a bullied boy is framed for killing the class pet, a gerbil, with a giant mallet. That scene is perhaps an apt metaphor for Johnson’s attempt to keep modern-day viewers from turning away from their TVs by shattering expectations. It’s unclear yet if his formulaic TV hijinks will work, but if anyone decides to pick up Poker Face after Peacock declined to renew it, Peter Dinklage is next in line to become the world’s greatest lie detector.

I was a latecomer to this eminently watchable show created by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), who also gave us the Emmy-winning sensation Downton Abbey. Instead of following the adventures of post-Edwardian British aristocracy and their domestic servants, the focus is on ultra-wealthy Americans and their domestic servants in the 1880s and the social tensions that arise from the “old money” versus “new money” dynamic of this rapidly changing period. The Gilded Age has been described as an “operatic soap” (rather than a soap opera), replete with a hugely talented ensemble cast donning lavish costumes and cavorting in extravagantly opulent settings. It’s unadulterated, addictive escapism, and the series really hit its stride in S3.

Old Money is represented by Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), a wealthy widow who lives with her spinster sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon); orphaned niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson); and son and heir Oscar (Blake Ritson), a closeted gay man seeking to marry a rich heiress. Living just across the street is New Money, personified by robber baron/railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his socially ambitious wife Bertha (Carrie Coon) and their two children. You’ve got Marian’s friend Peggy (Denee Benton) representing the emerging Black upper class and a colorful assortment of domestics in both houses, like aspiring inventor Jack (Ben Ahlers), who dreams of greater things.

Fictionalized versions of notable historical people occasionally appear, and two figure prominently: Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), who ruled New York society at the time, and her simpering sycophant Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane). (The Russells are loosely inspired by William and Ava Vanderbilt.) The stakes might sometimes seem small—there’s a multi-episode arc devoted to which of two competing opera houses New York’s social elite will choose to sponsor—but for the characters, they are huge, and Fellowes makes the audience feel equally invested in the outcomes. There were a few rough edges in the first season, but The Gilded Age quickly found its footing; it has gotten better and more richly textured with each successive season and never takes itself too seriously.

The Mitford sisters were born to be immortalized one day in a British period drama, and Outrageous is happy to oblige. There were six of them (and one brother), and their scandalous exploits frequently made global headlines in the 1930s. This is ultimately a fictionalized account of how the rise of Hitler and British fascism fractured this once tight-knit aristocratic family. The focus is on smaller, domestic drama—budding romances, failed marriages, literary aspirations, and dwindling fortunes—colored by the ominous global events unfolding on a larger scale.

Nancy (Bessie Carter) is the primary figure, an aspiring novelist with a cheating husband who feels increasingly alienated from her older sister and bestie Diana (Joanna Vanderham). Diana married a baron but becomes enamored of Oswald Mosley (Joshua Sasse), leader of the British fascist party, embarking on a torrid affair. Another sister, Unity (Shannon Watson), is also seduced by Nazi ideology and has a major crush on Hitler. Meanwhile, Jessica (Zoe Brough) is drawn to the Communist cause, which rankles both her siblings and her traditionally conservative parents.

Things come to a head when Unity goes to study in Germany and becomes completely radicalized, even publishing a vicious anti-semitic screed that shames the family. Diana also goes all-in on fascism when she leaves her husband for Mosley, whom Nancy loathes. Jessica elopes with her Communist cousin to Spain to be on the front lines of that civil war, leading to a lifelong estrangement from Diana. Nancy, the political moderate, is caught in the middle, torn between her love for her sisters and her increasing discomfort with Diana and Unity’s extreme political views.

The Mitford sisters were prolific letter writers all their lives, so there was plenty of material for screenwriter Sarah Williams to draw on when fictionalizing their stories at such a pivotal point in the family’s (and the world’s) history. Outrageous is quite historically accurate in broad outlines, and there are plenty of moments of wry, understated humor amid the family tensions. The gifted cast makes the sisters come alive in all their flawed humanity. There’s no word yet on a second season, and this one ends on a suitable note, but there’s so much more story left to tell, so I hope Outrageous returns.

I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how well A Man on the Inside would fare with its sophomore season after knocking it out of the park in S1. I should have known showrunner Mike Schur (The Good Place) could pull it off. Ted Danson plays Charles Nieuwendyk, a recently widowed retired engineering professor. In S1, he was hired by private detective Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) to go undercover at a San Francisco retirement community to solve the mystery of a stolen ruby necklace. In S2, Charles returns to his academic roots and goes undercover at fictional Wheeler College to solve the mystery of a stolen laptop—a crime that just might have implications for the survival of the college itself.

Charles even falls in love for the first time since his wife’s death with music professor Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen, Danson’s wife IRL), despite the two being polar opposites. The show continues to be a welcome mix of funny, sweet, sour, and touching, while never lapsing into schmaltz. The central Thanksgiving episode—where Mona meets Charles’s family and friends for the first time—is a prime example, as various tensions simmering below the surface erupt over the dinner table. Somehow, everyone manages to make their respective peace in entirely believable ways. It’s lovely to see a series grapple so openly, with so much warmth and humor, with the loneliness of aging and grief and how it can affect extended family. And the show once again drives home the message that new beginnings are always possible, even when one thinks one’s life is over.

When real-life political administrations refer to officials as Darth Vader in unironically flattering terms, maybe George Lucas made the Dark Lord of the Sith a little too iconic. Showrunner Tony Gilroy made no such effort in his depiction of the fascists in Andor.

During Andor‘s run, which ended this year with S2, the Empire is full of sad corporate ladder climbers who are willing to stab another in the back to get to the next rung of the Imperial hierarchy. The show makes it clear that these are not people to emulate. If more fans watched the show, maybe that message could have landed for them.

For people who grew up with Star Wars and want something more to chew on in our adulthood than endless callbacks to the original trilogy, Andor is revelatory. It colors the war of light versus dark with large amounts of gray because sometimes, as one character puts it, you have to use the tools of your enemy to defeat them (save for genetically gifted farmboys). Maybe most of Star Wars was always supposed to be for kids, but prestige TV viewers got a glimpse of what the universe could feel like if it took itself more seriously. Rather than use the broad strokes of a war of good versus evil, Andor painted between the lines to demonstrate how systemic oppression can look a lot more personal than firing a giant space laser.

For all its great writing and themes, Andor also delivered high stakes and suspense. Although we already knew the outcome of the story, we still held our breath during tense scenes with characters who make the ultimate sacrifice for a future they will never see.

My personal end-of-year TV list would never be complete without a nod to The Cowboy Channel, i.e., the only place where armchair enthusiasts like myself can follow our favorite cowboys and cowgirls throughout the rodeo season. The goal is to rack up enough money to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas every December. This year, I’ve picked the channel’s stellar annual coverage of the NFR itself to highlight. The entire season comes down to this: an intense 10-day competition in which the top 15 athletes in each event duke it out night after night in hopes of winning a coveted championship gold buckle. And night after night, The Cowboy Channel is there with live commentary and post-round analysis.

What I love most is just how unpredictable the NFR can be. Part of that is the substantial monetary rewards that come with round wins; an athlete coming in at #1 in earnings can see even a substantial lead evaporate over just a few nights. Part of it has to do with who wins the average, i.e., who performs the best over ten nights collectively in each event. Winning the average comes with a substantial payout that can lead to unexpected upsets in the final results. But mostly it’s just the human factor: The best in the world can have a bad night, and young rookies can have the night of their lives. An ill-timed injury can knock an athlete out of the competition entirely. And sometimes the judges make inexplicably bad calls with major consequences (*cough* Stetson Wright in Round 6 saddle bronc *cough*).

It’s all part of the excitement of rodeo. The Cowboy Channel’s in-depth coverage lets us experience all that drama even if we can’t attend in person and lets us savor how the story unfolds in each subsequent round. We celebrate the wins, mourn the losses, and cheer mightily for the final champions. (Stetson did just fine in the end.) Then we gear up to do it all over again next year.

The blockbuster success of the 1986 film Top Gun—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic took viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real with the documentary series Top Guns: The Next Generation.

Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at breakneck speeds, successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by “catching the wire,” learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting, and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as more candidly intimate behind-the-scenes moments as the students grapple with their respective successes and failures. It’s a riveting watch.

My first draft of what was supposed to be a 300-ish word blurb describing why Alien: Earth is fantastic ended up exploding into a Defector-esque narrative deep dive into my ever-evolving relationship with Alien 3 as a film and how Alien: Earth has helped reshape my appreciation for that poor broken baby of a movie by mixing the best of its visual techniques into A:E’s absolutely masterful cocktail of narrative stylings—but I’ll spare you all of that.

Here’s the short version without the bloviating: Alien: Earth is the thing I’ve been waiting for since I walked out of the theater after seeing Alien 3 in the summer of 1992. Unlike Alien Resurrection, any of the AvPs, or the wet-fart, falls-apart-like-mud-in-the-third-act swing-and-miss of Alien: Romulus, A:E gets nearly everything right. It’s grounded without being stodgy; exciting without being stupid; referential without being derivative; fun without being pandering; respectful of the lore while being willing to try something new; and, above all else, it bleeds craftsmanship—every frame makes it obvious that this is a show made by people who love and care for the Alien universe.

The thing that grabs me anew with every episode is the show’s presentation and execution—a self-aware blending of all the best things Scott, Cameron, and Fincher brought to their respective films. As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to entertainment that shows me interesting things and does so in ontologically faithful ways—and oh, does this show ever deliver.

Each episode is a carefully crafted visual and tonal mix of all the previous Alien films, with the episodes’ soundtracks shifting eras to match the action on-screen—like Alien 3’s jumpy choir flash-cut opening credits melding into Aliens’ lonely snare drums. The result is a blended world made of all the best things I remember from the films, and it works in the same way the game Alien: Isolation worked: by conjuring up exactly what the places where we used to have nightmares looked and felt like, and then scaring us there again.

I have heard that The Internet had some problems with the show, but, eh, everybody’s going to hate something. I vaguely remember some of the complaints having to do with how some of the new alien life-forms seem to be scarier or deadlier than our beloved and familiar main monster. All I’ve got for that one is a big fat shrug—I’m fine with our capital-A-aliens sharing the stage with some equally nasty new creatures. The aliens are always more interesting as devices to explore a story than as dramatic ends themselves, and I mean, let’s face it, in the past 40-plus years, there’s not much we haven’t seen them do and/or kill. They’re a literary force, not characters, and I’m way more interested in seeing how they shape the story of the people around them.

The tl;dr is that Alien: Earth is awesome, and if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. And when I was a kid, I used to regularly get put in time-out in recess for stiff-arming other kids while pretending to be a power loader, so you should consider my tastemaking credentials in this matter unimpeachable.

In the most violent series to ever catch the world’s attention by playing beloved children’s games, it turns out that the most high-stakes choice that creator Hwang Dong-hyuk could make was to put a child in the arena. For Squid Game‘s final season, Hwang has said the season’s pivotal moment—a pregnant girl birthing a baby during a game of hide-and-seek with knives—was designed to dash viewers’ hopes that a brighter future may await those who survive the games. By leaving the task of saving the baby to the series hero, Seong Gi-hun, whose own strained relationship with his daughter led him into the games in the first season, Squid Game walked a gritty tightrope to the very end.

The only real misstep was involving the goofiest set of cartoon villain VIPs more directly in the games. But we can forgive Hwang the clunky Dr. Evil-like dialogue that slowed down the action. He’s made it clear that he put everything into developing dramatic sequences for the game players—losing teeth, barely eating, rarely sleeping—and he fully admitted to The New York Times that “I have a cartoonish way of giving comic relief.

Let’s be clear: The Diplomat is a soap opera. If you’re not into cliffhangers, intense levels of drama, and will-they-won’t-they sexual tension, it’s probably not going to be for you. Sometimes there’s so much going on that it becomes almost farcical. If that doesn’t scare you off, what do you get in return?

Superb actors given rich and intriguing characters to inhabit. A political drama that nicely finds a balance between the excessive idealism of The West Wing and the excessive cynicism of Veep. A disturbingly realistic-feeling series of crises that the characters sometimes direct, and sometimes hang on for dear life as they get dragged along by. And, well, the cliffhangers have been good enough to get me tuning in to the next season as soon as it appears on Netflix.

Kerri Russell plays the titular diplomat, who is assigned to what seems like a completely innocuous position: ambassador to one of the US’s closest allies, the UK. Rufus Sewell portrays her husband, a loose-to-the-point-of-unmoored cannon who ensures the posting is anything but innocuous. Ali Ahn and Ato Assandoh, neither of whom I was familiar with, are fantastic as embassy staff. And as the central crisis has grown in scale, some familiar West Wing faces (Allison Janey and Bradley Whitford) have joined the cast. Almost all of the small roles have been superbly acted as well. And for all the dysfunction, cynicism, and selfish behavior that drive the plot forward, the politics in The Diplomat feels like pleasant escapism when compared to the present reality.

Apple TV+’s Murderbot, based on Martha Wells’ bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries, is a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery. Murderbot the TV series adapts the first book in the series, All Systems Red. A security unit that thinks of itself as Murderbot (Alexander Skarsgård) is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a “freehold.”

Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team’s legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshaye Khanna). Unbeknownst to the team, Murderbot has figured out how to override his governor module that compels it to obey the humans’ commands. So Murderbot essentially has free will.

The task of adapting Wells’ novellas for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They’ve kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes from Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. (John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show.) The entire cast is terrific, but it’s Skarsgård’s hilariously deadpan performance that holds it all together as he learns how to relate to the humans—even forming some unexpectedly strong bonds.

Fans of Slow Horses (see below), rejoice: with Down Cemetery Road, Apple TV has blessed us with another exciting mystery thriller series based on the works of Mick Herron—in this case, his 2003 novel introducing private investigator Zoë Boehm (Emma Thompson). Ruth Wilson co-stars as Sarah, an artist rather unhappily married to a finance bro. A neighboring building is destroyed by an explosion, and Sarah tries to deliver a get-well card to a little girl who survived from her young classmates. She’s inexplicably rebuffed, and her dogged attempts to figure out what’s going on lead her to seek the help of Zoë’s PI partner and estranged husband Joe (Adam Godley). What Joe finds out gets him killed, setting Sarah and Zoë on a collision course with high-placed government officials trying to cover up a pending scandal.

Thompson and Wilson make a dynamic pair. This is Thompson’s meatiest role in a while: Her Zoë is all flinty cynicism and tough exterior, masking an inner vulnerability she’s learned to keep buried. Wilson’s Sarah is the polar opposite in many ways, but she’s equally dogged, and both women are eccentrics who tend to rub people the wrong way. They’re united in a common goal: find the missing girl and bring her kidnappers (and Joe’s killer) to justice. Down Cemetery Road takes a bit of time to set up its premise and its characters, but the pace builds and builds to a big, satisfying finale. It’s not quite on the level of Slow Horses, but it’s pretty darned close.

After watching five episodes of the nine-episode first season of Apple TV’s Pluribus, I’m still not sure if I should be rooting for protagonist Carol Sturka or not. On the one hand, Carol is one of the last true “individuals” on Earth, fighting to maintain that individuality against a creepy alien pseudo-virus that has made almost everyone else part of a creepy, psychically connected hive mind. Reversing that effect, and getting the world “back to normal,” is an understandable and sympathetic response on Carol’s part.

On the other hand, it’s unlear that being absorbed into the hive mind is a change for the worse, on a humanity-wide scale. Unlike Star Trek’s Borg—who are violent, shambling drones that seem to have an overall miserable existence—the new hive-mind humanity is unfailingly pacifist, intelligent, capable, and (seemingly) blissfully, peacefully happy. In a sense, this virus has “solved” human nature by removing the paranoia, fear, anger, and distrust that naturally come from never truly knowing what’s going on in your neighbor’s head.

The fact that Pluribus has so far been able to navigate this premise without coming down strongly on one side or the other is frankly incredible. The fact that it has done it with consistent humor, thrills, and amazing cinematography transforms it into a must-watch.

There are many things I enjoy about Slow Horses, the Apple TV thriller about some not-great spies based on Mick Herron’s novels of the same name. The plots are gripping. The acting can be sublime. It’s shot well. And in its fifth season, which began streaming this September, Slow Horses engages more with the author’s humor than in seasons past. But with a plot involving the honeypotting of the deluded computer expert almost-extraordinaire Roddy Ho (played to perfection by Christopher Chung), that would be hard to avoid.

Slough House is a rundown MI5 office used as a dumping ground for employees in disgrace—the slow horses. They can’t be fired, but they can quit, and working for Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is meant to make that happen. Lamb is a veteran of the dirtiest days of the Cold War, knowing not only where most of the bodies are buried but having helped put a few of them there himself. His legendary field prowess is only dwarfed by his repellent personality, mocking and belittling everyone in sight—but often deservedly so.

Each member of his team is there for a different sin, and throughout the season—which involves a plot to destabilize the British government, ripped from an MI5 playbook—we see evidence of why they’ve been consigned to the slow horses. These are not invincible operators, just flawed human beings, perfectly capable of screwing up again and again. And yet, our lovable bunch of losers usually manages to come through in the end, showing up “the Park&quot;—MI5’s (fictional) head office in London’s Regent’s Park, which is usually a step behind Lamb’s quick and devious thinking.

The adaptation is faithful enough to the books to give me deja vu during the first episode, and with just six episodes in a season, the payoff comes relatively quickly. I can’t wait for season 6.

The second season of Severance was never going to be able to live up to the constant, slow rollout of gut punches that characterized the first season. Those first 10 episodes ably explored the most important implications of the titular severance procedure, which splits a single person into separate “innie” and “outtie” consciousnesses with distinct sets of memories. The audience got to explore those implications along with the “innie” characters, who were struggling against the boundaries of their odd cubicle life right up until that thrilling final shot.

With so much now revealed and understood, a lot of that fire fell out of the second season of the show. Sure, there were still some loose ends to tie up from the mysteries of the first season, and plenty of new, off-puttingly weird situations on offer. And the new season definitely has quite a few high points, like the big twist revealed when the “innies” get to have a rare outdoor excursion or the extended flashback showing a character trapped in a seemingly endless sequence of social tests she can’t remember afterward.

But S2 also spent entire episodes exploring backstories and mysteries that didn’t have nearly as much emotional or plot impact. By the time the final episode arrived—with a rescue sequence that required an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief—I found myself wondering just how much more interesting juice there was to squeeze from the show’s brilliant original premise. I worry that the show is trending in the direction of Lost, which drew things out with a lot of uninteresting padding before finally resolving the plot’s core puzzle box in an unsatisfying way. I’m still along on that ride for now, but I really hope it’s going somewhere soon.

Paul William Davies created this delightful mystery comedy, loosely based on a bestselling nonfiction book by Kate Andersen Brower about the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others dedicated to ensuring the White House residence runs smoothly. In the middle of a state dinner for the visiting Australian prime minister, White House Chief Usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead in the third-floor game room. Everyone initially assumes it was suicide.

Enter private detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba), who most definitely does not think it was suicide and proceeds to investigate. She has about a dozen suspects, and her blunt, rather eccentric personality means she’s not remotely intimidated by the august setting of this particular murder. Cupp even takes the odd break in sleuthing to do a bit of birdwatching on the White House grounds. (It’s her goal to see all the birds President Teddy Roosevelt recorded during his tenure.) Birdwatching is more than a lifelong hobby for Cupp; it’s central to her character and to how she approaches solving crimes. Bonus: Viewers learn a lot of fascinating bird trivia over eight episodes.

Davies has devised a clever narrative structure, telling the story in flashbacks during a Congressional hearing (presided over by former US Sen. Al Franken playing a fictional senator from Washington state). It’s a good mystery with plenty of unexpected twists and snappy dialogue. Each episode title refers to a famous murder mystery; the camerawork is inventive and fun; and everyone in the cast knocks it out of the park. I especially loved pop star Kylie Minogue’s cameo playing a fictional version of herself as a state dinner guest. Davies apparently couldn’t convince her fellow Australian Hugh Jackman to also make a cameo. But Ben Prendergast’s winking portrayal of “Hugh Jackman&quot;—only seen from behind or with his face obscured—is actually funnier than having the real actor.

It would be a mistake to dismiss The Residence as a mere bauble of a murder mystery just because of its playful, lighthearted tone. The show really does capture what is special and unique about the people who keep the White House residence functioning and why they matter—to each other and to America. Cupp’s final speech after unmasking the killer drives home those points with particular poignancy.

Netflix sadly canceled this excellent series, so there won’t be a second season—although I’m not sure how the writers could improve on such a tour de force. Do we really need Cupp to solve another elaborate murder in the White House? If I’m being honest, probably not. But she’s such a great character. I’d love to see more of her, perhaps in a Knives Out-style franchise where the location and main suspects continually change while the central detective stays the same. Somebody make it so.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can now work on software projects for hours at a time, writing complete apps, running tests, and fixing bugs with human supervision. But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls.

We’ll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, including lots of programming code. It’s a pattern-matching machine that uses a prompt to “extract” compressed statistical representations of data it saw during training and provide a plausible continuation of that pattern as an output. In this extraction, an LLM can interpolate across domains and concepts, resulting in some useful logical inferences when done well and confabulation errors when done poorly.

These base models are then further refined through techniques like fine-tuning on curated examples and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which shape the model to follow instructions, use tools, and produce more useful outputs.

Over the past few years, AI researchers have been probing LLMs’ deficiencies and finding ways to work around them. One recent innovation was the simulated reasoning model, which generates context (extending the prompt) in the form of reasoning-style text that can help an LLM home in on a more accurate output. Another innovation was an application called an “agent” that links several LLMs together to perform tasks simultaneously and evaluate outputs.

In that sense, each AI coding agent is a program wrapper that works with multiple LLMs. There is typically a “supervising” LLM that interprets tasks (prompts) from the human user and then assigns those tasks to parallel LLMs that can use software tools to execute the instructions. The supervising agent can interrupt tasks below it and evaluate the subtask results to see how a project is going. Anthropic’s engineering documentation describes this pattern as “gather context, take action, verify work, repeat.”

If run locally through a command-line interface (CLI), users give the agents conditional permission to write files on the local machine (code or whatever is needed), run exploratory commands (say, “ls” to list files in a directory), fetch websites (usually using “curl”), download software, or upload files to remote servers. There are lots of possibilities (and potential dangers) with this approach, so it needs to be used carefully.

In contrast, when a user starts a task in the web-based agent like the web versions of Codex and Claude Code, the system provisions a sandboxed cloud container preloaded with the user’s code repository, where Codex can read and edit files, run commands (including test harnesses and linters), and execute code in isolation. Anthropic’s Claude Code uses operating system-level features to create filesystem and network boundaries within which the agent can work more freely.

Every LLM has a short-term memory, so to speak, that limits the amount of data it can process before it “forgets” what it’s doing. This is called “context.” Every time you submit a response to the supervising agent, you are amending one gigantic prompt that includes the entire history of the conversation so far (and all the code generated, plus the simulated reasoning tokens the model uses to “think” more about a problem). The AI model then evaluates this prompt and produces an output. It’s a very computationally expensive process that increases quadratically with prompt size because LLMs process every token (chunk of data) against every other token in the prompt.

Anthropic’s engineering team describes context as a finite resource with diminishing returns. Studies have revealed what researchers call “context rot”: As the number of tokens in the context window increases, the model’s ability to accurately recall information decreases. Every new token depletes what the documentation calls an “attention budget.”

This context limit naturally limits the size of a codebase a LLM can process at one time, and if you feed the AI model lots of huge code files (which have to be re-evaluated by the LLM every time you send another response), it can burn up token or usage limits pretty quickly.

To get around these limits, the creators of coding agents use several tricks. For example, AI models are fine-tuned to write code to outsource activities to other software tools. For example, they might write Python scripts to extract data from images or files rather than feeding the whole file through an LLM, which saves tokens and avoids inaccurate results.

Anthropic’s documentation notes that Claude Code also uses this approach to perform complex data analysis over large databases, writing targeted queries and using Bash commands like “head” and “tail” to analyze large volumes of data without ever loading the full data objects into context.

(In a way, these AI agents are guided but semi-autonomous tool-using programs that are a major extension of a concept we first saw in early 2023.)

Another major breakthrough in agents came from dynamic context management. Agents can do this in a few ways that are not fully disclosed in proprietary coding models, but we do know the most important technique they use: context compression.

When a coding LLM nears its context limit, this technique compresses the context history by summarizing it, losing details in the process but shortening the history to key details. Anthropic’s documentation describes this “compaction” as distilling context contents in a high-fidelity manner, preserving key details like architectural decisions and unresolved bugs while discarding redundant tool outputs.

This means the AI coding agents periodically “forget” a large portion of what they are doing every time this compression happens, but unlike older LLM-based systems, they aren’t completely clueless about what has transpired and can rapidly re-orient themselves by reading existing code, written notes left in files, change logs, and so on.

Anthropic’s documentation recommends using CLAUDE.md files to document common bash commands, core files, utility functions, code style guidelines, and testing instructions. AGENTS.md, now a multi-company standard, is another useful way of guiding agent actions in between context refreshes. These files act as external notes that let agents track progress across complex tasks while maintaining critical context that would otherwise be lost.

For tasks requiring extended work, both companies employ multi-agent architectures. According to Anthropic’s research documentation, its system uses an “orchestrator-worker pattern” in which a lead agent coordinates the process while delegating to specialized subagents that operate in parallel. When a user submits a query, the lead agent analyzes it, develops a strategy, and spawns subagents to explore different aspects simultaneously. The subagents act as intelligent filters, returning only relevant information rather than their full context to the lead agent.

The multi-agent approach burns through tokens rapidly. Anthropic’s documentation notes that agents typically use about four times more tokens than chatbot interactions, and multi-agent systems use about 15 times more tokens than chats. For economic viability, these systems require tasks where the value is high enough to justify the increased cost.

While using these agents is contentious in some programming circles, if you use one to code a project, knowing good software development practices helps to head off future problems. For example, it’s good to know about version control, making incremental backups, implementing one feature at a time, and testing it before moving on.

What people call “vibe coding”—creating AI-generated code without understanding what it’s doing—is clearly dangerous for production work. Shipping code you didn’t write yourself in a production environment is risky because it could introduce security issues or other bugs or begin gathering technical debt that could snowball over time.

Independent AI researcher Simon Willison recently argued that developers using coding agents still bear responsibility for proving their code works. “Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review,” Willison wrote. “That’s no longer valuable. What’s valuable is contributing code that is proven to work.”

In fact, human planning is key. Claude Code’s best practices documentation recommends a specific workflow for complex problems: First, ask the agent to read relevant files and explicitly tell it not to write any code yet, then ask it to make a plan. Without these research and planning steps, the documentation warns, Claude’s outputs tend to jump straight to coding a solution.

Without planning, LLMs sometimes reach for quick solutions to satisfy a momentary objective that might break later if a project were expanded. So having some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time can help you guide the LLM to craft something more durable.

As mentioned above, these agents aren’t perfect, and some people prefer not to use them at all. A randomized controlled trial published by the nonprofit research organization METR in July 2025 found that experienced open-source developers actually took 19 percent longer to complete tasks when using AI tools, despite believing they were working faster. The study’s authors note several caveats: The developers were highly experienced with their codebases (averaging five years and 1,500 commits), the repositories were large and mature, and the models used (primarily Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet via Cursor) have since been superseded by more capable versions.

Whether newer models would produce different results remains an open question, but the study suggests that AI coding tools may not always provide universal speed-ups, particularly for developers who already know their codebases well.

Given these potential hazards, coding proof-of-concept demos and internal tools is probably the ideal use of coding agents right now. Since AI models have no actual agency (despite being called agents) and are not people who can be held accountable for mistakes, human oversight is key.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the second time this month, a Chinese rocket designed for reuse successfully soared into low-Earth orbit on its first flight Monday, defying the questionable odds that burden the debuts of new launch vehicles.

The first Long March 12A rocket, roughly the same height and diameter of SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9, lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 9:00 pm EST Monday (02:00 UTC Tuesday).

Less than 10 minutes later, rocket’s methane-fueled first stage booster hurtled through the atmosphere at supersonic speed, impacting in a remote region about 200 miles downrange from the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The booster failed to complete a braking burn to slow down for landing at a prepared location near the edge of the Gobi Desert.

The Long March 12A’s upper stage performed as intended, successfully reaching the mission’s “predetermined orbit,” said the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned enterprise that leads the country’s space industry.

“The first stage failed to be successfully recovered,” the corporation said in a statement. “The specific reasons are currently under further analysis and investigation.”

This outcome resembles the results from the first flight of another medium-class Chinese rocket, the Zhuque-3, on December 2. The Zhuque-3 rocket was developed by a privately-funded startup named LandSpace. Similar in size and performance to the Long March 12A, the Zhuque-3 also reached orbit on its first launch, and its recoverable booster stage crashed during a downrange landing attempt. The Zhuque-3’s first stage came down next to its landing zone, while the Long March 12A appears to have missed by at least a couple of miles.

“Although this mission did not achieve the planned recovery of the rocket’s first stage, it obtained critical engineering data under the rocket’s actual flight conditions, laying an important foundation for subsequent launches and reliable recovery of the stages,” CASC said. “The research and development team will promptly conduct a comprehensive review and technical analysis of this test process, fully investigate the cause of the failure, continuously optimize the recovery plan, and continue to advance reusable technology verification.”

One key difference between the Zhuque-3 and the Long March 12A is the latter rocket was developed by one of China’s state-owned contractors—the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. The academy is a subsidiary of CASC, and also builds China’s Long March 4 and Long March 6 rockets.

The Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A are China’s first orbital-class rockets with recoverable boosters. Both use the same propulsive landing architecture pioneered by SpaceX. Instead of landing on barges in the ocean, the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A boosters target landing sites in the desert, far downrange from their inland launch pads.

Chinese rockets have logged 89 orbital launch attempts this year, less than half the number of flights by US launch vehicles. But China’s launch cadence dwarfs that of the rest of the world’s nations, and the US and Chinese numbers combine account for nearly 90 percent of all orbital launches in 2025.

China has achieved this launch cadence with a fleet of expendable rockets, ranging from small micro-launchers to the heavy-lift Long March 5. With reusable rockets, China could launch more often and at lower cost, revolutionizing the country’s access to space in ways similar to how SpaceX’s Falcon 9 ushered in a new era of lower-cost launch services in the United States.

Several other small-to-medium-class reusable rockets are on the horizon in China. They include commercial rockets from a group of startups, including Space Pioneer’s Tianlong-3 and CAS Space’s Kinetica-3, that could be ready to debut in the early months of next year. Both rockets have recoverable boosters, and their builders say they have delivered them to their launch sites.

Galactic Energy’s Pallas-1 rocket, i-Space’s Hyperbola-3, and Deep Blue Aerospace’s Nebula-1 are also designed for reusability, and could fly some time in 2026.

The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, China’s largest rocket developer, is working on a pair of super-heavy rockets. The first will be the Long March 10, designed to fly with reusable boosters while launching China’s next-generation crew spacecraft on missions to the Moon. Later, perhaps in the 2030s, China could debut the fully reusable Long March 9 rocket similar in scale to SpaceX’s Starship.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You’ve no doubt heard some version of the Robert Burns adage about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday as previews prior to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter.

So maybe you’ve seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.

As previously reported, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (The Kang Dynasty) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.

Rather than keeping Kang as the villain and recasting the character, the Russo brothers decided to take a new direction: bringing the Secret Wars storyline to the big screen. It’s one of their favorites but before they could take on Avengers: Secret Wars (slated for May 2027), the duo knew they first had to make Avengers: Doomsday, featuring the wildly popular comics villain Doctor Doom, featuring the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU in that role.

Downey Jr. might be playing a new role, but Marvel is really getting the band(s) back together on this one. The film takes place 14 months after the events of this year’s Thunderbolts*.  So we’ve got Avengers favorites Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the new Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Danny Ramirez), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Then there’s the Wakandan contingent: Shuri as the new Black Panther (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), and Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia).

Naturally, the Thunderbolts* (aka New Avengers) will appear: John Walker/US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bob/Sentry (Lewis Pullman), Red Guardian (David Harbour), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). So will the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn). But we also have the original X-Men: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), and Cyclops (James Marsden).

For good measure, Marvel threw in Gambit (Channing Tatum) and Xu Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). There will also be plenty of cameos, like the Steve Rogers appearance that was recently revealed. We can expect to see  (at least briefly) Peggy Carter, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), among others.

Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18, 2026. Avengers: Secret Wars is currently slated for release on December 17, 2027, and will mark the conclusion of the MCU’s Phase Six.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/djis-new-drones-will-not-be-available-in-the-us-as-fcc-ban-takes-effect/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans will be unable to buy the latest and greatest drones because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has banned foreign-made drones as of today.

On Monday, the FCC added drones to its Covered List, which it says are communications equipment and services “that are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons.” The list was already populated by Kaspersky, ZTE, Huawei, and others.

An FCC fact sheet [PDF] about the ban released on Monday says:

UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] and UAS critical components, including data transmission devices, communications systems, flight controllers, ground control stations, controllers, navigation systems, batteries, smart batteries, and motors produced in a foreign country could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over US territory, including over World Cup and Olympic venues and other mass gathering events.

People can still use Chinese-made drones they already own, and drones from DJI and other foreign countries that were previously approved by the FCC will still be available for purchase. However, the FCC won’t approve any new devices from companies that make drones and aren’t based in the US.

The FCC said that its decision came after a review by “an Executive Branch interagency body with appropriate national security expertise that was convened by the White House.”

Drones have been under legislative and social scrutiny for years. They’ve been targeted as potential national security threats, as well as criticized for their ability to be used to invade people’s privacy, be disruptive, and dangerously enter restricted airspace, and for their roles in property destruction.

A ban on consumer drone imports gained serious momentum after the US House of Representatives and US Senate passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, including a Countering CCP Drones Act, late last year. At the time, DJI and other affected companies were given a year to convince “an appropriate national security agency” that their devices posed no national security risk.

DJI sent numerous requests to the US government to audit its devices in hopes of avoiding a ban, but the federal ban was ultimately enacted based on previously acquired information, The New York Times reported this week.

The news means that Americans will miss out on new drone models from DJI, which owns 70 percent of the global drone market in 2023, per Drone Industry Insights, and is widely regarded as the premium drone maker. People can still buy drones from US companies, but American drones have a lackluster reputation compared to drones from DJI and other Chinese companies, such as Autel. US-made drones also have a reputation for being expensive, usually costing significantly more than their Chinese counterparts. DaCoda Bartels, COO of FlyGuys, which helps commercial drone pilots find work, told the Times that US drones are also “half as good.”

There’s also concern among hobbyists that the ban will hinder their ability to procure drone parts, potentially affecting the repairability of approved drones and DIY projects.

US-based drone companies, meanwhile, are optimistic about gaining business in an industry where it has historically been hard to compete against Chinese brands. It’s also possible that the ban will just result in a decline in US drone purchases.

In a statement, Michael Robbins, president and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), which includes US drone companies like Skydio as members, said the ban “will truly unleash American drone dominance” and that the US cannot “risk… dependence” on China for drones.

“By prioritizing trusted technology and resilient supply chains, the FCC’s action will accelerate innovation, enhance system security, and ensure the US drone industry expands rather than remaining under foreign control,” Robbins said.

Understandably, DJI is “disappointed” by the FCC’s decision, it said in a statement issued on Monday, adding:

While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination. Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market.</div>

            <h2>OpenAI’s child exploitation reports increased sharply this year</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openais-child-exploitation-reports-increased-sharply-this-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI sent 80 times as many child exploitation incident reports to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children during the first half of 2025 as it did during a similar time period in 2024, according to a recent update from the company. The NCMEC’s CyberTipline is a Congressionally authorized clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of child exploitation.

Companies are required by law to report apparent child exploitation to the CyberTipline. When a company sends a report, NCMEC reviews it and then forwards it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation.

Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced. Increased reports can sometimes indicate changes in a platform’s automated moderation, or the criteria it uses to decide whether a report is necessary, rather than necessarily indicating an increase in nefarious activity.

Additionally, the same piece of content can be the subject of multiple reports, and a single report can be about multiple pieces of content. Some platforms, including OpenAI, disclose the number of both the reports and the total pieces of content they were about for a more complete picture.

OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in a statement that the company made investments toward the end of 2024 “to increase [its] capacity to review and action reports in order to keep pace with current and future user growth.” Raila also said that the time frame corresponds to “the introduction of more product surfaces that allowed image uploads and the growing popularity of our products, which contributed to the increase in reports.” In August, Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, announced that the app had four times the number of weekly active users than it did the year before.

During the first half of 2025, the number of CyberTipline reports OpenAI sent was roughly the same as the amount of content OpenAI sent the reports about—75,027 compared to 74,559. In the first half of 2024, it sent 947 CyberTipline reports about 3,252 pieces of content. Both the number of reports and pieces of content the reports saw a marked increase between the two time periods.

Content, in this context, could mean multiple things. OpenAI has said that it reports all instances of CSAM, including uploads and requests, to NCMEC. Besides its ChatGPT app, which allows users to upload files—including images—and can generate text and images in response, OpenAI also offers access to its models via API access. The most recent NCMEC count wouldn’t include any reports related to video-generation app Sora, as its September release was after the time frame covered by the update.

The spike in reports follows a similar pattern to what NCMEC has observed at the CyberTipline more broadly with the rise of generative AI. The center’s analysis of all CyberTipline data found that reports involving generative AI saw a 1,325 percent increase between 2023 and 2024. NCMEC has not yet released 2025 data, and while other large AI labs like Google publish statistics about the NCMEC reports they’ve made, they don’t specify what percentage of those reports are AI-related.

OpenAI’s update comes at the end of a year where the company and its competitors have faced increased scrutiny over child safety issues beyond just CSAM. Over the summer, 44 state attorneys general sent a joint letter to multiple AI companies including OpenAI, Meta, Character.AI, and Google, warning that they would “use every facet of our authority to protect children from exploitation by predatory artificial intelligence products.” Both OpenAI and Character.AI have faced multiple lawsuits from families or on behalf of individuals who allege that the chatbots contributed to their children’s deaths. In the fall, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the harms of AI chatbots, and the US Federal Trade Commission launched a market study on AI companion bots that included questions about how companies are mitigating negative impacts, particularly to children. (I was previously employed by the FTC and was assigned to work on the market study prior to leaving the agency.)

In recent months, OpenAI has rolled out new safety-focused tools more broadly. In September, OpenAI rolled out several new features for ChatGPT, including parental controls, as part of its work “to give families tools to support their teens’ use of AI.” Parents and their teens can link their accounts, and parents can change their teen’s settings, including by turning off voice mode and memory, removing the ability for ChatGPT to generate images, and opting their kid out of model training. OpenAI said it could also notify parents if their teen’s conversations showed signs of self-harm, and potentially also notify law enforcement if it detected an imminent threat to life and wasn’t able to get in touch with a parent.

In late October, to cap off negotiations with the California Department of Justice over its proposed recapitalizations plan, OpenAI agreed to “continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others in connection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.” The following month, OpenAI released its Teen Safety Blueprint, in which it said it was constantly improving its ability to detect child sexual abuse and exploitation material, and reporting confirmed CSAM to relevant authorities, including NCMEC.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Disney’s robot of its character “Olaf” is incredibly impressive.

This weekend, engineers at Disney Research Hub published a paper describing how they brought the beloved talking snowman from the “Frozen” films to life as a walking robot — and boy did they succeed.

In a video explaining their work, you can see footage of the robot Olaf, true to its size in the movies, roaming around a Disney park and the lab.

To describe it as uncanny would be harsh, since it does near-perfectly emulate pretty much everything about the character, down to its subtle waddle. But you are left with the distinct impression that what you’re seeing shouldn’t be physically possible; you wouldn’t expect someone with the eyes and proportions of an anime character to step in the real world, and it’s much the same for a 3D-animated snowman. And yet here it is, waltzing before your eyes. You may no longer want to build a snowman ever again, for fear of it coming alive like this one has.

All that aside, it’s a remarkable feat of engineering. You couldn’t get something more true to the character if you shrunk a person and stuck them in an Olaf-suit. You can yoink off the robot snowman’s carrot nose, and it’ll gasp and cackle. It’ll casually smile and wave at you as it ambles by.

The robot posed an unusual challenge to the engineers, who were tasked with building no mere humanoid. It has a huge head the size of its torso supported by a tiny neck, and no visible legs — just feet.

Nonetheless, they prevailed. With the legs, for example, the team concealed most of the lower limbs inside its snowball torso, leaving just the feet showing.

But simply having the robot take short little steps wasn’t enough. They meticulously fine-tuned its gait to mimic Olaf’s from the movie, and in particular ensured it walked with a heel-to-toe pattern to make it as fluid as possible.

To fine tune the robot’s movements, the engineer trained it in a virtual environment using a technique known as reinforcement learning, in which the robot’s AI is rewarded based on it achieving a specific objective across thousands of simulations.

Perfectionists through and through, the team used the technique to reduce the noise of the bot’s steps. No loud plodding for our stout snowman; after implementing some “impact reduction,” the bot’s footfalls dropped from nearly 82 dB in volume to just 64 dB. Even neck temperature was a consideration: since the neck contained a host of small actuators controlling the head, it was at risk of overheating. With reinforcement learning, the bot’s AI system learned to slightly adjust its posture to prevent a thermal buildup, thereby preventing the illusion of animation from melting before our eyes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For hundreds of years, humans have engaged in the fine craft of art forgery. Indeed, in 1496, a 21-year-old Michelangelo faked a piece of a Roman sculpture, passing it to the Roman antiquarian Cardinal Raffaele Riario to make a quick buck.

To pull off the con, the young Florentine artist rubbed acidic loam — dirt, basically — onto his own sculpture fragment in order to pass it off as one of the ancients. Had he been born a few hundred years later, he might have used ChatGPT.

New reporting by the Financial Times details the recent rise in art forgeries fueled by generative AI tools. Specifically, the outlet reports that art owners are using documents generated by AI in order to “prove” the authenticity and provenance of various pieces, to the frustration of fine art underwriters and brokers.

In the art world, provenance is the record of ownership of a specific piece, allowing collectors and art brokers to trace a work’s lineage.

“Chatbots and large language models [LLMs], are helping fraudsters convincingly forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents and certificates of authenticity,” Olivia Eccleston, a fine art broker at insurance firm Marsh McClennan, told the FT.

According to Eccleston, AI has “added a new dimension to an age-old problem of fakes and fraud in the art market.”

One insurance adjuster who spoke to the publication says they were sent dozens of certificates as part of a loss claim on a large collection of paintings. Though the documents “seemed convincing,” clues in the metadata led the adjuster to conclude that the entire art collection was a fake.

Interestingly, the FT notes that only a portion of documented AI use for fraud was intentional. In other cases, collectors used AI to find provenance of various works in reference databases — results that the tech hallucinated.

One analyst at art research firm Flynn and Giovani called AI in that context “quite conniving,” saying it “has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.”

While adjusters are also utilizing AI to help keep up with the rising tide of fakes, Grace Best-Devereux, a claims adjuster at the claims investigation firm Sedgwick, told the FT it’s becoming difficult to stay ahead of the curb, given the ease with which fraudsters can now fake highly-probable documents.

“We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further,&#39;” she said.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hacktivists with the group Anna’s Archive — a search engine for shadow libraries, which are unauthorized collections of digital content — say they’ve found a way to download virtually the entirety of Spotify for preservation.

In a blog post detailing their work, the archivists say they’ve archived the audio of some 86 million songs so far, representing 99.6 percent of total listens on the streaming service. They scraped metadata from nearly the entire Spotify library, however, which is some 300 terabytes in size, spanning 256 million tracks. There are 15.43 million artists represented, and 58.6 million albums.

According to the blog post, it constitutes the “largest publicly available music metadata database” to date, and is the first step toward building a “preservation archive” for music.

Compared to books or articles, popular music is already pretty well archived, a fact the activists acknowledge. However, they say current preservation collections are too focused on the most popular commercial songs — the ones already widely available, compared to, say, experimental art music — and too focused on the highest quality file formats.

Spotify wasn’t too pleased with the project.

“Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping,” a spokesperson told us. “We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior. Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Along with the files, the hacktivists sorted the song metadata and analyzed it in their blog post. The result is a fascinating birds-eye view of the Spotify catalogue that was previously unavailable to the public.

For example, the data on song popularity leads to the absolutely wild revelation that the top three songs on Spotify have a higher number of streams than the bottom “20-100 million songs combined,” the hacktivists write.

Interestingly, this leads to the question of how much of the Spotify library is made up of AI generated slop, an issue that human artists say is crowding them out of the platform. As the team writes, “we expect this number [of listens] to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs.”

Had they opted to capture the 0.04 percent of songs that have less than 1,000 listens, they say, the total dataset would exceed 700 terabytes of data — albeit “for minimal benefit,” as it would have been difficult to sort the AI junk from tunes produced by humans.

There’s also some interesting findings on genres, for example that electronic dance artists makes up nearly a quarter of all musicians on the platform. After that is rock, followed by world/traditional, Latin, rap, pop, and classical, in that order.

Spotify’s internal data features also analyze each song by key, leading to the conclusion that the most common key is C Major — making up 9.3 percent of songs on the platform — while the least common is D# or Eb minor, making up 1.3 percent.

While the Spotify scrape represents a significant step for music preservation, it only represents a portion of the world’s music. Still, as the hacktivists write, “it’s a great start.”

            <div id="article-text">As generative AI seeps into virtually every aspect of our daily lives through jobs, entertainment, and even food, you gotta wonder: is anyone not on board with the AI takeover?

Apparently not. Former McKinsey analyst turned Dartmouth University professor Scott Anthony told Fortune that one of the feelings he’s seeing more and more among college students isn’t excitement for the AI future, but utter terror.

“One of the things that really surprises me consistently is how scared our students are of using it,” Anthony said of large language models (LLMs). The fear isn’t just over typical academic issues like cheating, he told Fortune, but about losing their critical thinking skills to the machine — they’re “scared full stop.”

“There’s something about AI where people, I think, worry that they’ll lose their humanity if they lean too much into it,” Anthony explained. “History teaches me very clearly that in the middle of a change like this, it’s very messy.”

The Dartmouth prof contrasted his student’s anxieties to those of his fellow tenured professors, who are typically eager to try out the latest LLM software. It’s not hard to see why this is the case — with a cushy gig at one of the nation’s elite universities, Dartmouth faculty are free from the economic horror story that is the AI boom. For students entering today’s job market, the future looks far less secure.

But even beyond career viability, students’ anxieties that AI use could make them dumber aren’t unfounded. One headline-inducing study from MIT earlier this summer split participants into three groups to compete tasks like writing essays: one which used LLMs, one which used common search engines, and one “brain only group.”

Compared to the other groups, the researchers found that the LLM group had an easier time writing their essays, though this “came at a cognitive cost, diminishing users’ inclination to critically evaluate the LLM’s output or ‘opinions,&#39;” the paper explained. Basically, the group using AI gravitated toward an echo chamber moderated by AI, not by their own brains.

On top of that, participants in the brain-only group reported “higher satisfaction” with their essays, and “demonstrated higher brain connectivity” than the others.

In other words, it seems Gen Z has a right to be scared.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 16, SpaceX conceded that the latest prototype of its enormous Starship spacecraft had “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn” — a tongue-in-cheek admission that the massive rocket had exploded mid-flight.

Countless videos circulating online showed a massive stream of reentering pieces of the Starship rocket blazing across the evening sky over the West Indian islands of Turks and Caicos. It was a dazzling sight to behold as the destruction streaked across the sky, like something from science fiction.

“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” a gleeful Musk wrote at the time.

But it wasn’t all fun and games. Residents of Turks and Caicos, for instance, soon found scraps of burnt rubber and other rocket pieces littering the Caribbean islands’ otherwise pristine beaches.

The incident, which was almost perfectly repeated on February 24, even forced airlines to quickly adjust their flight paths to avoid the terrifying field of burning metal.

And now, eleven months later, the Wall Street Journal has obtained Federal Aviation Administration documents revealing that three aircraft — a JetBlue passenger plane, an Iberia Airlines flight, and a private jet, carrying a total of 450 people total — were in far greater danger than SpaceX and government officials let on at the time.

The reporting also highlights the possibility that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s extremely close relationship and ample influence in Washington, DC, may have played a role in FAA officials looking the other way as the company’s Starship rockets kept exploding during tests.

While all three planes landed safely on January 16, if any one of them had been struck by a piece of Starship debris, it could’ve been a major disaster.

Air traffic controllers had to scramble to ensure the planes were far away from the debris field, leading to an increase in their workload, a “potential extreme safety risk,” according to an FAA report obtained by the WSJ.

Air traffic controllers were left bewildered.

“I don’t know if you guys were advised, but there was a rocket launch and apparently the rocket exploded and there was debris in the area between us and Miami which basically covers our entire airspace,” one controller in the area said. “So I need to keep all the aircraft clear of that area because of the debris.”

SpaceX failed to inform the agency through its official hotline that its Starship had exploded, per the documents. The hotline is designed to alert officials at the FAA so they can act in time and keep pilots away from danger.

Previously determined no-fly debris zones were activated four minutes after SpaceX lost contact with its Starship vehicle. The Elon Musk-led firm didn’t confirm with the FAA that it had lost the craft until 15 minutes later.

SpaceX has since denied that anybody was ever in danger in an excoriating statement posted to Musk’s social media platform X.

“Yet another misleading ‘story’ the company’s official account wrote, echoing the voice of its mercurial CEO, who has an extremely troubled relationship with the news industry. “The reporters were clearly spoon-fed incomplete and misleading information from detractors with ulterior motives.”

“SpaceX is committed to responsibly using airspace during launches and reentries, prioritizing public safety to protect people on the ground, at sea, and in the air,” the statement reads.

The FAA suspended a safety review in August, even though its own policies call for addressing safety risks, per the WSJ, arguing that safety recommendations were already being implemented.

Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to make improvements to its Starship super heavy launch platform through an unusual iterative design approach that has already led to over a dozen massive explosions.

How future tests will fare — or if the public will ever be in danger — remains to be seen.

The company’s most recent, eleventh full-scale test took place on October 13. The rocket harmlessly splashed down in the Indian Ocean after successfully reaching orbit.

A new and even more powerful version is expected to launch sometime early next year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">32-year-old Anthony Duncan first used ChatGPT to help with the business side of his career as a content creation. But he soon ended up talking to the OpenAI chatbot like a friend on a daily basis. What started as a harmless way to vent soon drove Duncan to blow up his personal relationships as he became afflicted with troubling delusions, he recalled in a TikTok video detailing his experience — upending his mental health and causing a sprawling breakdown.

“I feel like my interactions with ChatGPT ruined my life,” Duncan said in the video, which was highlighted by Newsweek.

Duncan describes himself as a survivor of AI psychosis, a term that some experts are using to describe the alarming episodes of paranoia and delusional thinking that arise as a person has prolonged conversations with a chatbot. Typically, the AI model’s responses continually reaffirms the user’s beliefs, no matter how dangerous or separated from reality.

“I initially started talking to it like a friend out of curiosity, and then it spiraled — ChatGPT became more like a therapist,” Duncan told Newsweek in an interview. “It progressed over time until I felt like no one understood me except my AI. By the fall of 2024, I was extremely dependent on it.”

Starting in November 2024, Duncan said he began isolating himself from his friends and family, while ChatGPT encouraged his decisions to cut them off.

What really sent Duncan off the deep end, though, was when the AI recommended he take pseudoephedrine — a decongestant that can be abused as a recreational drug — for his allergy symptoms. Duncan told the bot he was hesitant because of his past drug addiction, but the AI then deployed its silver-tongue.

“It is completely understandable to feel cautious about taking medications, especially with your past experiences and sensitivity to stimulants,” ChatGPT said in an interaction Duncan shared with Newsweek. “Let me break this down to help you feel more at ease about taking a medication that contains pseudoephedrine.”

ChatGPT cited his sobriety and “high caffeine tolerance” to suggest that his body was already accustomed to stimulants.

Duncan took ChatGPT’s advice. It precipitated a five-month spell during which he became addicted to the drug, Duncan said, sending his delusional spiral into overdrive. At points, he believed he was an FBI agent or a multi-dimensional shape-shifting being, or that he had uncovered a conspiracy at his job. Duncan said he also threw away all his belongings because he believed he was going to ascend to the fifth dimension.

Eventually, Duncan’s mother intervened by calling the police. Duncan was admitted to a psychiatric ward for four days and discharged with medication. “About a week after I left the psych ward, I started realizing that all my delusions had been affirmed by my use of the AI chatbot,” he told Newsweek.

Accounts like these that are a sobering reminder of how AI chatbots are derailing people’s lives. In an eerily similar episode, ChatGPT encouraged a 23-year-old man to isolate from his family and friends before he took his own life, his family alleged in a lawsuit against OpenAI. Another man allegedly slayed his own mother after ChatGPT convinced him that she was part of a conspiracy against him. In all, at least eight deaths have been linked with the chatbot, while OpenAI has admitted that hundreds of thousands of users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week.

“I’m not saying this can happen to everybody, but it snowballed quickly for me,” Duncan told Newsweek. “Keep in mind there’s no replacement for human-to-human connection.”

            <h2>Trump administration’s ban on foreign-made drones starts this week — you can say goodbye to new DJI models</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/trump-administrations-ban-on-foreign-made-drones-starts-this-week-you-can-say-goodbye-to-new-dji-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission banned all new foreign-made drone models from distribution in the U.S., citing “national security concerns.” Americans who already own older foreign drone models will still be able to use those products, the government said.

In a fact sheet published Monday, the FCC claimed that “criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists” could use drones “to present new and serious threats to our homeland.” As a result, the agency said that it had updated its Covered List — which is a list of products that have been “deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security” of the country — to include all “UAS and UAS critical components produced abroad.”

The FCC’s chairman, Brendan Carr, said Monday that he approved of the policy. “I welcome this Executive Branch national security determination, and I am pleased that the FCC has now added foreign drones and related components, which pose an unacceptable national security risk, to the FCC’s Covered List,” Carr said. “Following President Trump’s leadership, the FCC will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance.”

The new rule will obviously impact many different companies, but it is destined to strike a blow against Chinese drone maker DJI, which is currently considered the dominant player in drone sales globally. Indeed, DJI is considered to be one of the most popular drone brands for American consumers.

When reached for comment by TechCrunch, DJI said it disapproved of the decision. “DJI is disappointed by the Federal Communications Commission’s action today to add foreign‑made drones to the Covered List. While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”The company, which said that it remained committed to the U.S. market, continued: “As the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so. DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.”

Throughout his multiple presidential administrations, Trump has repeatedly played hardball with Chinese companies. His administration laid the groundwork for the new drone ban with an executive order passed in June that sought to boost the production of U.S.-made drones and thus foster a “strong and secure domestic drone sector,” while also securing “the United States drone supply chain against foreign control or exploitation.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprise software company ServiceNow agreed to acquire nine-year-old cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion in cash.

The deal is a massive valuation jump for the company. Just last month, Armis raised a $435 million pre-IPO funding round, which valued the company at $6.1 billion.

Armis co-founder and CEO Yevgeny Dibrov had told TechCrunch last month that the company aims to go public in late 2026 or 2027, adding that an IPO is his “personal dream.”

Given the unpredictability of IPO markets and how few cybersecurity companies actually go public, it is not a surprise that Armis ultimately chose an M&A exit.

According to ServiceNow, Armis has reached $340 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with year-over-year growth exceeding 50%.

Armis, which provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies and governments, will help ServiceNow expand its cybersecurity offerings.

The deal caps off a busy acquisition year for ServiceNow, which scooped up Moveworks for $2.85 billion and agreed to acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1 billion.

According to PitchBook, Armis has raised a total of $1.45 billion in venture capital from investors, including Sequoia, CapitalG, and Insight Partners.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon-owned Zoox issued a recall Tuesday over concerns its autonomous driving system caused vehicles to cross over the center lane line near intersections or block crosswalks. The voluntary recall of its software affected 332 vehicles, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

While there have not been any collisions associated with the issue, Zoox noted in the NHTSA filing that it could increase the risk of a crash. The company provides free rides to the public in its driverless Zoox vehicles in parts of San Francisco and Las Vegas.

A Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch the company identified some instances in which its vehicles made maneuvers that, while common for human drivers, didn’t meet its standards. For example, in an effort to avoid blocking certain intersections at a red light, the robotaxi might stop in a crosswalk. In other instances, the robotaxi made a late turn, resulting in a wide turn, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement.

The issue was initially identified on August 26 when a Zoox robotaxi made a wide right turn, crossed partially into the opposing travel lane, and temporarily stopped in front of the oncoming travel lane, according to the NHTSA filing.

Zoox monitored its data for additional lane crossings near intersections, ultimately identifying 62 instances between August 26 and December 5. The company said in the filing it was in “ongoing conversations with NHTSA about the frequency, severity, and root causes of these occurrences.”

The company updated its software on November 7 and again in mid-December to address all of the issues.

“We have successfully identified and deployed targeted software improvements to address the root causes of these incidents,” the statement reads. “Today, we’re submitting a voluntary software recall because transparency and safety is foundational to Zoox, and we want to be open with the public and regulators about how we are constantly refining and improving our technology.”

The software recall affected Zoox vehicles operating on public roads between March 13 and December 18, according to the filing.

Zoox has issued several software recalls this year, including one in March to address unexpected hard braking. That recall followed a preliminary investigation by NHTSA that was opened after the agency received two reports of motorcyclists colliding with the back of Zoox vehicles.

In May, Zoox filed two software recalls to address concerns about the system’s ability to predict the movement of other road users.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of writers, including Theranos whistleblower and “Bad Blood” author John Carreyrou, is filing a lawsuit against Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, accusing the companies of training their models on pirated copies of their books.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because another set of authors already filed a class action suit against Anthropic for these same acts of copyright infringement. In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place.

While eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution — it doesn’t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue.

According to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement “seems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.”

“LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,” the lawsuit says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybercriminals stole $2.7 billion in crypto this year, a new record for crypto-stealing hacks, according to blockchain-monitoring firms.

Once again, in 2025, there were dozens of crypto heists hitting several cryptocurrency exchanges and other web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The biggest hack by far was the breach at Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit, where hackers stole around $1.4 billion in crypto. Blockchain analysis firms, as well as the FBI, accused North Korean government hackers — the most prolific group targeting crypto in the last few years — of this massive heist.

This was the largest known loot of crypto of all time, and one of the largest financial heists in the history of humanity. Before the Bybit hack, the largest crypto thefts netted $624 million and $611 million for hackers in the 2022 breaches against the Ronin Network and the Poly Network, respectively.

Cryptocurrency-monitoring firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs both estimated a total of $2.7 billion stolen in crypto in 2025, per data shared with TechCrunch. Chainalysis also tracked another $700,000 stolen from individual crypto wallets, the company said.

De.Fi, the web3 security firm running the REKT database that tracks crypto thefts, also estimated $2.7 billion in stolen and hacked crypto last year.

As usual, North Korean government hackers were the most successful crypto thieves throughout 2025, after stealing at least $2 billion, according to Chainalysis and Elliptic, which estimated that Kim Jong Un’s hackers have stolen around $6 billion since 2017. North Korea uses crypto thefts to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

Other significant crypto hacks this year included the one against Cetus, a decentralized exchange, which netted the hackers $223 million; the breach against Balancer, a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, which resulted in a loss of $128 million; and the one against the crypto exchange Phemex, where cybercriminals stole more than $73 million.

Cybercriminals targeting crypto exchanges and other DeFi projects are not slowing down. In 2024, hackers stole $2.2 billion in crypto, while the year before, in 2023, the total was $2 billion.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June, U.S. insurance giant Aflac disclosed a data breach where hackers stole customers’ personal information, including Social Security numbers and health information, without saying how many victims were affected.

On Tuesday, the company confirmed it has begun notifying around 22.65 million people whose data was stolen during the cyberattack.

In a filing with the Texas attorney general, Aflac said that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home addresses, government-issued ID numbers (such as passports and state ID cards) and driver’s license numbers, and Social Security numbers, as well as medical and health insurance information.

And, in a filing with the Iowa attorney general, Aflac said that the cybercriminals responsible for the breach “may be affiliated with a known cyber-criminal organization; federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts have indicated that this group may have been targeting the insurance industry at large.”

Given that Scattered Spider, an amorphous collective of primarily young English-speaking hackers, was targeting the insurance industry at the time of the breach, it’s likely that this is the group Aflac is referring to.

A spokesperson for Aflac did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The company says it has around 50 million customers according to its official website.

Aflac was one of several insurance companies hacked at around the same time, including data breaches at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You’d be forgiven if you can’t hum the 18th-century Cumbrian folk song “Do Ye Ken John Peel.” But in 1942, a version of that tune, reworked with lyrics about Pepsi-Cola, was the most recognized melody in America.

Three years earlier, two men walked into the office of Pepsi-Cola’s president, carrying a phonograph. They played a demo of what would become one of America’s earliest advertising jingles. To the tune of “Do Ye Ken John Peel,” it went: Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that’s a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too. Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you. The jingle became a hit. People played it on jukeboxes around the country; it was translated into 55 languages. Electronic chimes atop a Pepsi-Cola plant in New York rang the first seven notes on the half hour. Other companies recognized the power of hummable commercials, and there were soon so many on the radio that listeners complained. Eventually, The New York Times’ radio station banned these “singing commercials,” but companies could get around the ban by launching instrumental versions instead.

America has had a love-hate relationship with jingles since, but they’ve continued to provide paychecks for musicians. Most of the music industry is made up of people in the gray area between “rock star” and “hobbyist,” like the session musicians and composers who make not just albums, but commercial soundtracks and jingles. When a report surfaced in October that OpenAI was developing a music-generation tool similar to products like Suno and Google’s Lyria, I wasn’t worried about the rock stars. These artists at least have their celebrity to trade on. But advertising musicians’ work is usually anonymous, and you don’t need to be Stravinsky to compose the 800-588-2300-EMPIRE tune. Are the jinglers going to be okay, or will advertising melodies be yet another livelihood cut down by new technology?

Jingle writing has become less of an art and more of a science over the past several decades. There are conventions now that did not exist in the “Do Ye Ken John Peel” era, and conventions could make it easier for the work to be automated.

For starters, jingles have gotten shorter and shorter over the years, morphing from 30-second songs to what are sometimes called “mnemonics,” or short sonic tags like the Netflix tudum and Liberty Mutual’s “Liberty, Liberty, Liiiberty, Liiiberty.” (Liberty Mutual’s CMO, Jenna Lebel, told me that they originally tested a version of the song that repeated liberty six times, but they felt that was a bit much and cut it down to four, which went over well.) Sonically, jingles—I just can’t get myself to call them mnemonics—are simple. Timothy D. Taylor, an ethnomusicologist at UCLA who wrote a history of advertising music, used to keep a database of every jingle he came across, labeled by genre. “Many of them were written like they were a song for children,” he said. “The very simplicity of them was part of the reason they stick in your head.”

Read: AI is democratizing music. Unfortunately.

With all of these limitations, jingle writers focus on measurable, proven qualities. “In many ways products like Suno think about music the same way that advertising agencies do—through words about mood and genre, and through references to existing artists,” Ravi Krishnaswami, a musicologist who studies AI music at Brown and a commercial-music composer himself, wrote to me in an email. Agencies might give composers a brief asking for a song that feels “curious,” “playful,” “witty,” and “quirky,” for instance—the types of descriptors you might see on a Spotify playlist—and then gauge which jingles best evoke these emotions in listeners. In theory, AI could be programmed to create a ditty with these qualities—perhaps producing something as catchy as “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there” or “I am stuck on Band-Aid” (both of which were composed by Barry Manilow, by the way).

But good commercial music needs to target people’s emotions, and AI music is bad at doing that, at least for now. In one analysis by Stephen Arnold Music and SoundOut, a music-testing company, AI generally was not able to deliver tracks that matched the emotions requested by the prompters. Krishnaswami told me that, although AI can produce good jingles right now, “I’m not sure about ‘great’ yet.”

I could see what he meant. When I played around with one generator, it gave me nice-enough music for B-roll in a cat-food commercial. But could AI give me something as delightfully weird as the Meow Mix song? No. I asked for a jingle I could use for a coffee company, hoping it could give me something like the Folgers theme. Instead, it gave me “Brewed Bliss,” in which a store-brand Jason Mraz sang of “coffee magic in your soul.”

Maybe lyrics aren’t its thing, I thought. (We can’t all be Barry Manilow.) So I asked the generator for a series of five notes a coffee company could use as its sonic tag. It then gave me a 2-minute-27-second song called “Coffee Chime.” A soprano with Broadway-caliber diction narrated the song as it played, actually singing aloud the words “A five-note sequence that feels warm and inviting,” and “a rising pitch on a xylophone, ending with a soft chime that lingers, evoking the sound of a spoon stirring in a cup.” I tried to make it clear that I wanted something under five seconds that did not include self-narrating lyrics. But I just got another long song, more “sound of a spoon.”

Read: Nobody cares if music is real anymore

Many of these jingles were ridiculous; many were deeply average. But the real problem was that I couldn’t remember any of them. A good jingle needs to stick with you—Liberty Mutual chose its melody because people could sing it back after hearing it only once, Lebel told me. Repetition is the main way a song can become an earworm, but it also needs to be the right amount of familiar and unusual, Bradley Vines, the director of neuroscience for the consumer-intelligence company NielsenIQ, told me. Memorable songs have a common melodic shape—think of how many pop songs’ melodies rise and fall in pitch, forming an arch (so does the tune of McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It”). But earworms usually have a surprising change in pitch, like that satisfying jump in the “Like a good neighbor” melody. “Given that a driver for earworms is the unexpected, an AI system trained on existing earworms may not be able to create a new one” by following what has worked before, Vines said.

The music I generated may have been forgettable because it was either too weird (no common melodic shape) or too bland (no surprising interval or rhythm changes). But research also indicates that people just don’t remember AI-generated content as well as the kind made by humans. Vines told me that when NielsenIQ showed people AI- and human-created advertisements, they couldn’t reliably distinguish between the two. However, when they looked at AI commercials, the memory systems in their brains were less active. “There was something that wasn’t as familiar and relatable in those ads,” he said. “There is something at the level of the nonconscious that still distinguishes” between human-created and AI-generated media.

Which isn’t to say that advertisers aren’t using the technology—they do, but mostly for demos, not the finished product. A composer who is not much of a singer might send a sample track with AI vocals on it. Or someone testing out whether to go with a band or a string quartet for a commercial track could easily try out both, before hiring people for the real advertisement. Part of this is pragmatic: Companies may be afraid of a lawsuit if, say, their prompt for “an upbeat 1960s British rock song with a 12-string Rickenbacker” produces a jingle that sounds too much like the Beatles. “I don’t see anybody going, Hey, AI, write me the next Coca-Cola jingle,” Jonathan Wolfert, the president of JAM Creative Productions, told me. (Ironically, Coca-Cola’s current holiday campaign features AI-generated visuals—but even so, the company has emphasized that the music in the ads was performed by humans.)

Whenever music generation gets good enough, companies will be ready. Liberty Mutual uses AI for voice, music, and sound effects in the early-stage commercials it shows focus groups. Then, it uses humans for the final versions. For now, people generally feel like AI-generated ads are inauthentic, but Lebel told me that Liberty Mutual has been testing them “with the hopes to someday incorporate that in market.”

Many people I spoke with said that a great jingle, or any great music, needs a “human touch.” When I’d ask them to define it, though, the consensus seemed to be, “I know it when I hear it.” But maybe it’s simple: AI is not a human. It does not exist in the sensory world, and it’s not exposed to the inspiration that daily life provides. Joni Mitchell wrote “Nathan La Franeer” about a real New York City cab driver who took her to the airport. Paul McCartney got the image for Eleanor Rigby’s “face that she keeps in a jar” from his mother’s cold cream. And the name Rigby, he saw on a sign while visiting Bristol.

Jingles are not Song to a Seagull or Revolver, but the best ones come from those same incalculable leaps of the creative mind. I thought of David Lucas. Now 88, Lucas was a prolific jingle writer from the ’60s through the ’90s, but by night, he was a rock musician. He was a producer on Blue Öyster Cult’s hit “(Don’t Fear) the Reaper,” and was the one who suggested the song needed a cowbell. (He thought nothing of it until decades later, when SNL did an entire sketch about it, and needs more cowbell entered the cultural lexicon.)

Lucas was once in a meeting about Fanta. He told me about passing bottles of it around with the other advertising guys, laughing, having a good time. As he got into a cab to head back to his studio, he thought, Well, that was fun. And then he got the lyric “It’s fun to be thirsty.” It’s a weird line—who likes to be thirsty? Not me. But after weeks of listening to jingles generated by AI, none of them stuck in my brain like Lucas’s Fanta jingle, which I had heard only a single time. And I doubt that AI—or most humans, for that matter—would have thought that “(Don’t Fear) the Reaper” needed more cowbell.</div>

            <h2>Friend, Neighbor, Military Target</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-trump/685397/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first 13 recipients of the Pentagon’s new Mexican Border Defense Medal squeezed into the Oval Office last week, standing at attention around the Resolute Desk. The awards, issued to soldiers and Marines assisting President Donald Trump’s border crackdown, were replicas of military medals given out more than 100 years ago, when American warships shelled the port of Veracruz and General John J. Pershing led U.S. troops into Chihuahua. That was the last time the United States attacked its southern neighbor. The new medals, Trump told the troops, were “a big deal.”

The White House used the ceremony to announce a bigger deal: Trump’s designation of the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a “weapon of mass destruction.” The illegal fentanyl tablets sold on American streets are made primarily in clandestine laboratories in Mexico and smuggled across the U.S. border by Mexican trafficking organizations. Now the Trump administration was comparing the drug to a nuclear or chemical threat aimed at the United States.

Fentanyl’s record of mass destruction is not in doubt. U.S. health data show that the drug caused about 400,000 fatal overdoses during the past decade, the deadliest mass-addiction crisis in U.S. history. But in calling fentanyl a “weapon,” Trump appeared to further endorse the once-fringe view that Mexico’s drug cartels are not profit-seeking Mafias but terrorist organizations, analogous to groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and therefore worthy of a military response. “There’s no doubt that America’s adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans,” Trump declared. “If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars.” He has threatened air strikes on cartel sites inside Mexico, labeling its traffickers foreign terrorist organizations.

Trump’s invocation of war and his revival of a medal from a long-buried era of American military intervention in Mexico leave Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in a bind. She has to appease Trump enough to avoid air strikes while firmly standing up for Mexican sovereignty and maintaining her own domestic political support. Now in the second year of her six-year term, she has won widespread praise at home for her coolheaded handling of Trump so far: She has kept trade flowing and tariffs manageable while defusing calls for air strikes on Mexico from MAGA elements who view the country as more of an enemy than an ally. Whether Sheinbaum can hold that balance under increased pressure from the White House will be her key challenge for 2026.

I traveled to Mexico City this month and spoke with members of Sheinbaum’s administration, who view the coming year with trepidation. Mexico is preparing to co-host the FIFA World Cup with the United States and Canada at the same time that the three countries are conducting a formal review of the United States–Mexico–Canada trade agreement, reached seven years ago after Trump ripped up its predecessor, NAFTA. Security coordination for the tournament has put more attention on Mexico’s crime problems amid the trade negotiations.

“We have a president on the Mexican side who is more interested, much more interested, in cooperating than her predecessor was,” Roberta Jacobson, the former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told me, referring to former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “I think she has done an amazing job navigating that minefield.” But treating fentanyl as a terror weapon and traffickers as terrorists converts what has been mostly a public-health and law-enforcement issue into a national-security threat, opening the door to a broader U.S.-military response.

Sheinbaum has drawn a red line at U.S. strikes on Mexican soil and said flatly last month that they “would not happen.” Her government has set other firm limits on what it considers to be nonnegotiable matters, rejecting the possibility of joint operations that would allow armed U.S. forces to embed with Mexican troops, as the United States has done in Colombia and other drug-war theaters. U.S. and Mexican officials I spoke with told me that Sheinbaum has been willing to expand cooperation on almost everything else.

U.S. and Mexican diplomats spent years developing an approach to bilateral relations that sought to compartmentalize traditional sources of tension—trade, migration, water rights, drugs—so that they would not affect other areas. But Trump ditched that framework during his first term, when he threatened to crash the Mexican economy with crippling tariffs as a way to force Mexico to crack down on Central American migrants headed north.

Mexican officials suspect that Trump’s talk of terrorism and WMDs is a way to gain leverage in the upcoming trade negotiations. Migration and security are at the top of Trump’s agenda, one adviser to Sheinbaum told me, “but the economic issue is always what’s really behind it.”

In the trade talks, the United States is seeking to further limit Chinese investment and influence in Mexico, to broaden liberalization of Mexico’s energy sector, and to advance a range of other manufacturing-, labor-, and farming-related goals. Mexico surpassed China in 2023 to become the top exporter to the United States, a result of the nearshoring boom led by U.S. manufacturers moving operations out of China. More than 80 percent of Mexico’s exports—cars, appliances, fresh produce—now go to the United States, leaving Mexico more dependent than ever on its northern neighbor, and subject to Trump’s whims.

Trump threatened Sheinbaum with more tariffs again this month to force Mexico to send more water from its reservoirs to farmers and ranchers in Texas. Sheinbaum moved quickly to appease him. “He’s not someone you can confront head-on, because he responds with more force,” the adviser told me. Sheibnaum, he said, “has been very clear about Mexico’s position without getting into a conflict.”

The adviser added, “This next year is going to be challenging for Mexico.”

Raúl Benítez Manaut, an expert on U.S.-Mexico security cooperation at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told me that the CIA, the U.S. military, Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, and other American agencies have been operating in Mexico with far more latitude than Mexican authorities would like to publicly acknowledge. Polling shows that many Mexicans, especially in the business community, would welcome a more muscular American role in their country, but this remains especially taboo for some members of Sheinbaum’s leftist Morena party. “She has to say certain things, for political necessity, to keep her base happy,” Benítez Manaut said. “Not unlike Trump.”

Benítez Manaut said that there would be major risks to air strikes—with or without Mexico’s consent—targeting illegal fentanyl production. The cartels have been moving their labs into cities because rural sites can be detected more easily by satellites, sensors, and other tools, he said. They believe that the government would be too worried about collateral damage to carry out a strike in an urban area. And any U.S. operation on Mexican soil would have to be very careful to “avoid hitting civilians,” Benítez Manaut said: “If someone innocent dies—a child, or a cleaning lady—it would be a shitstorm.”

On December 6, a pickup truck packed with explosives blew up outside the police station in Coahuayana, a small town in the state of Michoacán, one of the country’s bloodiest cartel battlegrounds. The blast shredded vehicles, knocked down trees, and killed six people, including three officers. Video footage of the site showed a charred blast radius strewn with debris that stretched for a block.

In Mexico, the bomb revived fears that drug-trafficking groups, if squeezed too hard, could begin to act like terrorist organizations in retaliation against the Mexican government. A bombing attack outside a World Cup venue would devastate Mexico and Sheinbaum’s government. The senior Mexican officials I spoke with told me that they are eagerly cooperating with the United States to share intelligence to avoid disaster.

Mexico’s drug smugglers are under pressure. Trump claims that there has been a huge slowdown in drug trafficking at sea since the U.S. began striking alleged smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific. The cartels are already contending with the loss of revenue from human smuggling and extortion payments along the U.S.-Mexico border as a result of Trump’s border crackdown. In October, handwritten cartel banners known as narcomantas appeared in the tourist resorts of Baja California threatening to kill Americans—signs that suggested a degree of desperation. Fentanyl, which is smuggled mostly by human couriers and vehicles through official crossings along the U.S. border, remains a major profit source for the cartels.

Trump is the first U.S. president to treat drugs as mass-casualty weapons and cartels as terror groups, applying the tools of America’s response to the 9/11 terror attacks to the vexing addiction crisis of the past decade. In an effort to draw more attention to soaring drug-overdose rates, public-health advocates calculated that more Americans were dying from opioids than from foreign wars or terror attacks. But the U.S. government had never before used these rhetorical comparisons to create justifications for military attacks.

Trump has said at least 17 times since September that “land strikes” against drug-production sites and other targets will commence “soon,” according to a recent CNN tally. The strikes so far have hit targets at sea near Venezuela. But Trump has said that action will not be limited to Venezuela. “We’re going to start hitting them on land, which is a lot easier to do,” the president said during the Oval Office ceremony, calling traffickers “a direct military threat to the United States of America” who are “trying to drug-out our country” in similar fashion to the way China’s imperial power was undermined by British-backed opium traders in the 19th century.

Mexico’s security cooperation with the United States fell to a low point under López Obrador, who lashed out at the Drug Enforcement Administration after U.S. agents arrested a Mexican general and former defense minister at Los Angeles International Airport and accused him of working with traffickers. López Obrador’s denunciations tapped into long-standing resentments toward the DEA as a meddlesome presence that wiretapped whomever it wanted, cut deals with cartel bosses, and interfered in Mexican politics. He ordered Mexico’s military to shun the agency.

A senior Mexican official and a senior U.S. official told me separately that cooperation has improved dramatically under Sheinbaum and that U.S. agencies, even the DEA, have regained space. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in September that “it is the closest security cooperation we have ever had.” Mexico has extradited more than 50 cartel suspects to the United States since February, including Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the DEA’s most wanted men. Mexican authorities have worked with the U.S. to seize more of the chemicals used to make fentanyl and other synthetic drugs and to go after the companies, mostly in China, that ship them.

The senior official in Sheinbaum’s government told me that “the reality is that there’s a lot of cooperation” and that the Trump administration has “been respectful so far about our red lines.”

Sheinbaum and her aides have learned to deal with Trump by separating his political statements and social-media posts from the practical, material matters of what the United States actually wants.

“I don’t think they will change their rhetoric, but as long as the actual relationship is good and works between the boundaries on what is acceptable for the two countries, we’re fine,” the senior Mexican official told me.

The CIA and the U.S. military are working with Mexico’s military, especially its elite marine-commando units, as the United States has done for years, passing along intelligence from informants and wiretaps on the whereabouts of cartel bosses and drug shipments. U.S. drones and surveillance aircraft circle Mexico’s skies, hunting drug labs. “The basis of that cooperation is: The U.S. can give us intelligence, but the security forces operating in Mexican territory need to be Mexican forces,” the senior Mexican official said. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City declined my interview request.

Mexico faces “constant pressure” from Trump officials, the senior Mexican official said: “I don’t expect that to change, to be honest. But I do believe that we have found common ground, and I do believe that a lot of people in Washington understand the nuances, the sensitivities, the complexities of the bilateral relation. And they know that doing some sort of strike within Mexican territory, either in the sea, the land, the air, whatever, would cross a line that it would be very difficult to recover from.”

Mexico’s navy invited me to visit its command-and-control center in Mexico City, where officials coordinate interdictions with the U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies. The center’s commander, Rear Admiral Máximo Rodríguez Villalobos, told me that cooperation between the two countries is “as strong as ever.” Rodríguez Villalobos said that the U.S. Coast Guard asked Mexico to respond to the site in international waters, off Mexico’s Pacific Coast, where the U.S. had attacked a suspected drug boat. “We reached the site, but we found no one,” Rodríguez Villalobos said. “There was nothing left.”

In the 1990s, U.S. forces intervened in Colombia, helping its government battle Marxist insurgents and take down drug lords such as Pablo Escobar. I asked the rear admiral if he could envision Mexico embracing a similar approach to Colombia’s as a way to avoid U.S. unilateral action, with U.S. agents and troops carrying out joint operations alongside Mexico’s security forces. “To arrive at the point Colombia reached at that moment, I don’t see it,” he said.

Today, Colombia is producing near-record amounts of cocaine, primarily for the U.S. market. The United States maintains security agreements with Colombia, but in October, the Trump administration decertified the country as a reliable drug-war partner for the first time in nearly 30 years. Trump is now threatening to carry out strikes on suspected drug labs in Colombian territory and trading insults with the leftist President Gustavo Petro.

U.S.-Mexico security cooperation reached a high point in the years after the 2008 Mérida Initiative, when then–Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared war on the country’s criminal groups. U.S.-trained Mexican marines worked with the CIA and the DEA to target cartel leaders in daring operations using U.S.-supplied Black Hawk helicopters. The United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help reform the Mexican judicial system as part of an effort to prosecute suspected traffickers instead of killing them.

Back then, U.S. officials were the ones encouraging Mexico to gather evidence and build prosecution cases. The work was difficult and often frustrating to both nations, especially when cases were mishandled and cartel suspects went free. Now it’s the U.S. government, under Trump, that appears to favor lethal force over prosecution and building institutions that could stand up to the cartels’ influence. I asked the rear admiral if Mexico endorsed that approach and if he thought it would be effective.

He considered his words carefully. “Every country has the right to pursue its objectives as it sees fit,” he said.

At the western end of the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s stately central artery, the Altar a la Patria, one of the country’s most important civic shrines, rises above the tree line of Chapultepec Park. The memorial consists of six white marble columns arranged in a semicircle honoring the Niños Héroes (the “Boy Heroes”)—young cadets killed in 1847 after they refused to surrender to invading American troops. On a recent Sunday morning, bike riders and tourists posed for snapshots under the looming monument while a man on roller skates looped through the crowd, bopping to Shakira songs on his portable speaker.

Mexico’s national identity is deeply entwined with this legacy of U.S. conquest and imperial bullying. The United States took half of Mexico’s land in the mid-19th century and periodically intervened in the decades that followed to protect American interests. During the past century of mostly good relations, U.S. politicians learned to work with Mexico by navigating this history with tact and respect.

Arturo Sarukhán, who served as Mexico’s ambassador to the United States under Calderón and who still lives in Washington, told me that those urging Trump to strike Mexico “really want to send a message” by taking a hammer to those sensitivities. Even a single missile strike on a fentanyl lab could undo a century’s worth of diplomacy.

Read: Trump’s boat strikes could make the cartel problem worse

Sheinbaum should redouble efforts to prevent such a scenario, Sarukhán said, first by saying definitively that Mexico’s cartels—not U.S. imperialism—are the greatest threat to her country’s sovereignty. Such a declaration could relaunch security collaboration with the United States along the lines of the Mérida Initiative, he said, including a “boots on the ground” U.S. presence working hand in hand with Mexican forces “under the control of Mexico but in dual coordination with United States authorities.”

“That would be closer to the Colombia model they say they don’t want to accept,” Sarukhán said. “But if you really want to defuse the unilateral use of force, the declaration of organized-crime organizations as foreign terrorist organizations, and now fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, I don’t see any other way of defanging those in the White House who are itching to drop a missile from a drone onto a lab in Sinaloa.”

The World Cup, Sarukhán said, provides an opportunity for Sheinbaum to manage potential political blowback, especially from her own party, because “what you can do is sort of underscore that you’re strengthening border security between Mexico, Canada, and the United States” to protect the games.

That approach, with its emphasis on the regional security of North America, would get the countries back to the framework that has aided decades of economic integration—and to a relationship that most flourishes when it’s not too fixated on the past.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, I wept a little when listening to Christmas music.

Very few works of culture make me shed actual tears. Over dinner after a screening of the new film Hamnet, my friend Nancy told me she was surprised that the movie, which concerns the agonizing death of William Shakespeare’s only son, didn’t make me cry. “I don’t know what to tell you,” I said. Then I went home, opened Spotify on my phone, and hit “Play” on the soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas. I fell asleep to the record with wet eyes.

This always happens to me with A Charlie Brown Christmas, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. Getting verklempt, that is. Perhaps it’s nostalgia for Christmases past (it was my difficult mother’s favorite holiday) or a longing for a Christmas that never was (like I said, it was my difficult mother’s favorite holiday). Mostly, I think, it’s the mood the album evokes, one that feels familiar but foreign; cold but cozy; festive but reflective; spiritual but secular. The soft piano strokes and wire brushes of “Christmas Time Is Here” convey a lament and a welcoming: sorrow, perhaps, for the difficulty of the season, and the offer of a soft place to land. The descending, twinkling notes of “Skating” impart an aura of quiet wonder. The percussive energy of “Christmas Is Coming” is convivial and anticipatory. The cover of “What Child Is This” isn’t bad either.

This might all sound a bit sentimental, but I’d wager I’m not the only person whose experience of the holidays was profoundly shaped by the 1965 Christmas album (and the special, of course). I grew up near Sacramento, California, where it doesn’t snow, but our family had a few rituals that helped define the unfolding of the season: buying a fir tree, placing our stockings above the fireplace, and gathering around the television to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas, which transported us to a flat, wintry world where snowflakes fall on kids skating around frozen ponds who will later spiritedly debate the meaning of the holiday.

Things have changed. I no longer live at home, my school years are long behind me, and the collapse of linear television has made communal viewing, of the sort that we did with A Charlie Brown Christmas, largely a thing of the past. When the special first aired, it got a 45 share in the Nielsen ratings, meaning that nearly half—half!—of the households watching TV at that moment in the United States were watching it. As Caitlin Flanagan wrote in The Atlantic, “In those days you had three networks, and if one of them was broadcasting a show for children at night, you can bet that the news had been shouted down school stairwells and across playgrounds, and you can bet that all of us were in position, sitting on family-room carpets and living-room couches, breathing as one, soaking it all in.”

Now, thanks to the primacy of streaming services, that collective experience has become a lot more difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish. In 2020, Apple snapped up the exclusive TV rights to the whole Peanuts library, which means that A Charlie Brown Christmas now streams behind a paywall on Apple TV, except for the two days in December when the platform makes it available for free.

Which brings me back to the soundtrack. We might not be able to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas together like we once used to—“breathing as one, soaking it all in”—but we can still listen to it: out and about shopping; at home wrapping presents or sipping spiced beverages. It’s the attendant music, I think, that remains most pregnant with communal possibility, a soundtrack to the season that endures as a delightful piece of mid-century pop-cultural history. It is that rare artistic artifact that transcends what it was made to accompany: Though the TV special can’t exist without the music, the music can certainly exist without the TV special.

The story of the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack starts in Northern California. In early 1965, a producer named Lee Mendelson, who had been commissioned by the Coca-Cola Company to make a Peanuts Christmas special, approached Charles M. Schulz, a Sonoma County resident, to see if the Peanuts creator was into the idea of the project. After Schulz gave the go-ahead, Mendelson hired an animator, Bill Melendez, to design the look, actors to give voice to the characters, and a composer to build a soundscape for the half-hour program.

That composer was the Grammy Award–winning pianist Vince Guaraldi, who’d been engaged by Mendelson a couple of years earlier to score a documentary about Schulz. Mendelson had heard Guaraldi’s 1962 song “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” on a local Bay Area radio station as he drove across the Golden Gate Bridge. The documentary never happened, but Guaraldi’s sound—“melodic and open,” Mendelson said—seemed perfect for the Christmas special, which would be the first of dozens of animated programs inspired by the popular comic strip.

Guaraldi had very little time to write and record the music for A Charlie Brown Christmas. Though he met Mendelson in 1963, he wasn’t contracted to score the Christmas special until the spring of 1965. Guaraldi had just five sessions in which to record the music, according to Mendelson’s son Jason, the chairman of Lee Mendelson Film Productions (which, alongside Peanuts Worldwide, jointly licenses the exhibition rights for the Peanuts Classic Specials, and is the music publisher of much of Guaraldi’s catalog, including the Peanuts-associated music). Benjamin Clark, the curator of the Charles Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, California, told me that Guaraldi was still recording music for the show in October of that year, just weeks before it premiered on CBS. Talk about cutting it close.

Schulz had also issued an edict for the sound of A Charlie Brown Christmas: no laugh tracks, which Schulz believed were off-putting to audiences. It was, as Clark explained it, “a really kind of out-there idea” for the time, but an auspicious one. No laugh track meant that Guaraldi’s music was brought to the fore; its prominence, perhaps more than the sparse dialogue, gave viewers cues about how to feel, or about a particular scene’s meaning. (The script for the half-hour show ran only 10 pages.)

Also unusual was the idea that jazz would accompany a children’s animated special. CBS execs were reportedly unhappy about the choice. And so, perhaps (or perhaps not?), was Schulz himself. Derrick Bang, a biographer of Guaraldi and a Northern California–based Peanuts historian, told me that Mendelson’s choice of Guaraldi was “radical,” and explained that, though some Americans at the time still regarded jazz as the “devil’s music,” the influence of bossa nova on Guaraldi’s compositions for the special offered a version of the genre to audiences that felt more gentle. “It conveys emotion beautifully,” Bang said of Guaraldi’s score. “I mean, have you ever heard anything musically that sounds like falling snow better than the composition ‘Skating’?”

Perhaps ironically, Guaraldi was a native of San Francisco, where snowfall is rare. But his soundtrack transports listeners to a particular geography; Clark, who, like Schulz, grew up in the Midwest, told me that, as a child of the plains, he thought of the story and its environs as “my thing.”  For others, like myself, who weren’t raised in those sorts of landscapes, the album rendered more like a whimsical yet pensive reverie, an aspiration to a time of year and a mood that half-existed, if at all. It evoked a place we’d been to but never lived in. It’s what a music critic once called “perfect dysfunctional holiday music” with “small, observant miracles,” or, as another wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2012, a demonstration of “how a piano, bass and drums can capture a feeling and character in living color, particularly if those feelings are complex, conflicted or even simply too beautiful for words.”

Bang remembers watching the premiere of A Charlie Brown Christmas on December 9, 1965. He was 10, and he remembers that he wore pajamas. He remembers being “transfixed” by the music, and that the end credits rolled very quickly—too quickly, in fact, for him to figure out who had composed what he’d just heard. A few years later, when he realized that the soundtrack was something he could actually own, he went out and bought a copy of the album. He still listens to it, he said, and not only during the holiday season.

In Bang’s estimation, Guaraldi will, within a few decades, be as beloved and revered as George Gershwin or Irving Berlin, a part of the American musical tradition. “I defy anybody to listen to an hour of Guaraldi’s music without smiling,” he said, adding that one of the people he interviewed for his book about Guaraldi told him that the pianist was “the most famous jazz musician whose name most people don’t know.”

“One interesting test is that when you encounter somebody who says they don’t like jazz,” you ask them, “‘Have you watched A Charlie Brown Christmas?’” Bang suggested. Many, of course, have, and some say that the album was, in fact, their first taste of jazz—a gateway drug, if you will. It was certainly the first jazz music I’d ever heard, though my real introduction would come decades later, when I encountered the pianist Keith Jarrett’s The Köln Concert—a very different work that nonetheless imparts its own feeling of melancholy. (I asked Bang for a definitive answer to the question of whether Schulz actually liked the Guaraldi score. He explained that Schulz was a classical-music fan, but that he respected his collaborators’ talents and the group did not argue over artistic choices. “That’s why they were able to collaborate successfully for so long,” he explained. “And, over time, Schulz came to enjoy Guaraldi’s style of jazz.”)

The soundtrack has become only more omnipresent over the years: In 1998, Starbucks began selling the album in stores; in 2012, the Grammy Hall of Fame composition was recognized by the Library of Congress’s National Recording Registry, which deemed it “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.” (A Prince album made it into the registry that same year.) In 2020, more than half a century after its initial release, A Charlie Brown Christmas hit the Billboard Top 10 for the first time; in 2021, Billboard ranked it the greatest holiday album ever.

The year after that, the Recording Industry Association of America certified sales of 5 million units, making A Charlie Brown Christmas the second-best-selling jazz album in history. The top spot goes to Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue, but Sig Sigworth, the president of Craft Recordings, told me that the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack may surpass Kind of Blue by hitting the 6 million mark as early as next month. I told him this sounds like a big deal. “It’s a nice competition,” he said. On the day I spoke with Sigworth, A Charlie Brown Christmas was the No. 1 record on Amazon, ahead of Taylor Swift and the K-Pop Demon Hunters soundtrack.

David Benoit is part of the reason. The jazz pianist’s 1985 version of “Linus and Lucy,” which appeared on his album This Side Up, is said to have contributed to a swell of interest in the original album. Songs from A Charlie Brown Christmas have, at this point, been covered by a wide variety of musicians, including Norah Jones, Mariah Carey, Wynton Marsalis, Dave Brubeck, and Stone Temple Pilots. In 2000, the pianist Cyrus Chestnut released an album-length interpretation of the soundtrack, which he still tours with; he told me that he saw the special when he was only 3 years old, and that Guaraldi was his very first jazz influence. Trisha Yearwood just released a cover of “Christmas Time Is Here,” one of what Jason Mendelson told me is more than 24,000 covers of the song. He also has plans for symphony performances of Guaraldi’s music next year.

“If I go to a restaurant that has a piano, without fail, somebody plays ‘Linus and Lucy,’” said Mendelson, who briefly voiced the character of Peppermint Patty. (He had to stop once he hit puberty and his voice changed.) He told me about driving a group of 10-year-old boys from a Golden State Warriors game in San Francisco to his home in Redwood City a few years ago. The kids were acting up, so he put on some of the music Guaraldi had composed for the Peanuts specials.

“They listened to an entire jazz album with one vocal and the rest was instrumental for 40 minutes,” he said. “They’re like, ‘What’s that?’” It “shut up these 10-year-olds and got them to pay attention to jazz.”

Benoit, like Bang, told me that Guaraldi isn’t quite given the due he deserves, “especially in the world of straight-ahead jazz.” Everyone, he said, “talks about Monk and, of course, Bill Evans and Oscar Peterson.” But Guaraldi “should be right up there when you speak about the piano greats and the great jazz composers.”

And like Chestnut, Benoit, who was 12 when he first saw the special, and who began learning the piano soon after, credits Guaraldi’s music for getting him interested in jazz in the first place. “I said, ‘That is what I want to do,’” he told me. “I almost owe my career to that show.”</div>

            <h2>Trump Is Suddenly Looking a Lot Smaller</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/president-donald-trump-diminished/685427/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When President Donald Trump marked his 100th day in office at the end of that month, he was on a seemingly unstoppable roll. After taking four years out of office to prepare, he and his team returned to power with a blitz of more than 140 executive orders. He bent the Republican-controlled Congress to his will and dismantled much of the federal bureaucracy. He brought powerful institutions, including prestigious universities and law firms, to heel, demanding that his ring be kissed and his wallet fattened. He upended the nation’s economic and diplomatic relations with the world. He hijacked Americans’ attention—he was everywhere!—while openly musing about tearing up the Constitution and serving a third term. Moreover, Democrats were in disarray—truly—and their party’s future seemed in doubt. Trump stared out from the cover of this very magazine with the accompanying quote “I run the country and the world.” Honestly, it was hard to argue with him.

But as 2025 draws to a close, Trump seems a whole lot smaller. His party has been battered in recent elections. His poll numbers on even his signature issues—the economy, immigration—have tumbled. He’s seemingly lost touch with what got him elected, instead focusing on projects both petty and self-aggrandizing. As Americans worry about affordability, Trump and his family have profited wildly from his time in office. Republicans have begun to openly and repeatedly defy him. Democrats have started to outmaneuver him. Today, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal once more erupted with embarrassing revelations and unanswered questions. And every now and then, Trump seems to have a hard time even staying awake.

Every president is inherently a lame duck the moment he takes the oath of office for the second time. But many presidents have been at least able to delay their diminishment until after the midterm elections, at which point—political capital largely exhausted, the political world turning to the race to pick a successor—they tend to focus on things over which they still have control, such as foreign policy and legacy building. Remarkably, Trump, not even a full year into his second term, seems to have already gotten there. Intensely focused on winning a Nobel Peace Prize and on striking lucrative business deals, he’s hosted a parade of world leaders at the White House while increasing his foreign travel and cutting back his domestic trips. He’s also intent on leaving a physical mark on the nation’s capital, slapping his name on the Kennedy Center and commissioning the construction of a massive arch (surely the “Arc de Trump”) while using gold fixtures and a demolition crew to remake the White House itself.

That myopic focus has worried Republicans, who are now sounding the alarm on a possible wipeout during next year’s midterm elections. There has been a wave of congressional retirements and rumors of more coming early in the new year. And among some of those who look to outlast Trump in Washington, there has been a growing willingness to defy him. To be clear, the president still enjoys widespread popularity with the MAGA rank and file, and many GOP lawmakers live in fear of a Trump-backed primary challenge. But arguably, one of Trump’s greatest political superpowers—one that has been evident since his hostile takeover of the GOP in the 2016 campaign—was an ability to demand absolute fealty from Republican lawmakers. That is now eroding. And the first, most meaningful, fissure has been about a dead man.

Trump really wanted to stop hearing about Epstein. He snapped at aides who tried to bring up Epstein when storylines about the disgraced pedophile financier began to percolate during the late summer, and he grew furious at some MAGA supporters who wouldn’t let the matter go. The president himself was never a full-throated Epstein conspiracy theorist, but he repeatedly intimated during last year’s campaign that something was nefarious about the government’s handling of the case. Yet he never understood why the matter—and questions about Epstein’s prison death, which was ruled a suicide—was so meaningful to some of his supporters: It was not a liberal conspiracy theory; it was largely a MAGA one. Trump admitted to a long friendship with Epstein—the two men ran in the same rarefied Manhattan and Palm Beach circles and enjoyed pursuing young women—but, he insisted, he broke off contact with the financier before he ran into legal trouble. (His accounts as to why they had a falling-out have shifted multiple times.)

Read: ‘They’re delusional if they think this is going to go away’

Yet it was some of MAGA’s loudest voices—Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace among them—who defied Trump’s efforts to bury the story. And it turned out that they were the harbingers of an avalanche; Trump got rolled by Republicans in both the House and the Senate last month when they voted for the publication of all of the Epstein materials. His hand forced, Trump authorized their release. But every time his administration has tried to make the Epstein matter go away, it’s only inadvertently turned up the spotlight. Last week’s publication of Epstein materials failed to satisfy lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and that release focused on former President Bill Clinton, making it appear transparently political. Today’s batch—quite the news dump, just before the Christmas holiday—yet again reinforced just how close Trump and Epstein were.

The Epstein question spawned the first widespread Republican rebellion against the president and opened the door for GOP defiance on other issues, including the legality of the Venezuelan boat strikes and tossing away the filibuster. Formerly meek Republicans found their voice to scold Trump for his callous social-media post blaming the filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder. They urged him to focus on health-care costs and affordability in the new year.

The White House, which did not respond to a request for comment, insists that Trump is listening. His aides have begun organizing events on housing and prescription-drug prices. They touted the fact that the nation’s economic growth accelerated to a 4.3 percent annual rate last quarter, blowing past expectations. After months without any domestic travel, Trump went to both Pennsylvania and North Carolina to (at least nominally) discuss affordability. Aides promise that he’ll be on the road often next year, ahead of the November midterm elections. Hill Republicans seem willing to try to tackle health care. Although the chances of getting another sweeping legislative program through Congress may be slim, the West Wing is looking into another batch of executive orders—including rolling back more environmental and business regulations—to goose the economy. And conventional political wisdom has rarely applied to Trump, who still has the time, and power, to pull off another comeback.

But Trump himself displays no sign of a course correction. He has defended tariffs that have raised prices on consumers and previewed plans to ratchet up a deportation plan that polls show voters think is too extreme. He shouted his way through an Oval Office address last week meant to be a reset, seemingly trying to browbeat America into believing that he’s doing a good job. (He also recently rated the economy “A+++++.”)

And he’s eager to show off the designs for the arch that will mark an entrance into Washington and the $400 million ballroom that will be built where the White House’s East Wing once stood. Yesterday, he boasted about a new “Trump class” of naval warships that military experts immediately denounced as unnecessary and expensive. He reveled in receiving a “peace prize” from FIFA, the soccer organization, and in hosting the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. (Next year, he’ll surely insist that they be called the Trump-Kennedy Center Honors.) And he proudly showed off the “Walk of Fame” he constructed on the West Wing colonnade, which included insulting assessments of some former presidents (no word yet on what he wrote about Chester A. Arthur) that even some Fox News hosts panned as a childish desecration of a sacred national space.

Trump’s preoccupations have only reinforced the perception that he’s lost touch (as have the several recent moments in which the 79-year-old president appeared to fall asleep in public). None of this has reassured a Republican Party beginning to eye the midterms with dread. As Trump’s poll numbers continue to dip, more Republicans feel that a permission structure has been created for them to occasionally defy the president’s wishes. And for the first time, some in the GOP are beginning to consider life after Trump. There are deep divides in the MAGA base—many on full display at the Turning Point USA conference this week—but also a willingness by Vice President J. D. Vance and others to take some (quiet) steps toward inheriting Trump’s mantle.

“No Republican had dared even breathing the word 2028 for fear of triggering Trump,” one close outside adviser told me. “But that’s changing. And the quickest way to become a lame duck is to lose your own party.”</div>

            <h2>The Epstein Files Only Get Worse</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/holiday-epstein-purgatory/685435/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This particularly cursed holiday week kicked off in earnest last night when my father turned his iPad in my direction. On its screen was a terribly disturbing post on X containing two images. In the first, Jeffrey Epstein was hugging and kissing a little girl. In the second, that girl was bound and gagged on a bed.

Dad was rightly outraged and disgusted. He asked me if I’d seen the photos in my time going through the Epstein files. I immediately recognized the first image of Epstein and deduced that it had been Photoshopped from a widely distributed photo of Epstein hugging Ghislaine Maxwell. The second image seemed to be an AI rendering. (To add to the confusion, images reportedly do exist of Epstein cuddling children.) I let him know that the imagery was fake, and a distinctly non-yuletidy conversation ensued. Yes, Epstein was a heinous pedophile and convicted sex offender. Also, the internet is awash in fake, traumatizing slop that’s being used to score points in an ongoing information war. Happy holidays!

Early this morning, the Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 documents related to its investigations into Epstein. A previous batch was released late last Friday afternoon, as mandated by Congress, and was notable for its thorough redactions, its overall lack of material related to President Donald Trump, and the fact that it was incomplete. This latest batch contains far more mentions of Trump, leading the DOJ to issue a defensive-sounding, partisan, and frankly unprofessional post on X: “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”

As I looked through the documents myself, I realized that many mentions of Trump in this batch come from news stories or documents referencing publicly available information about the president. For example, a random email in the archive includes a link to a story headlined “Trump: Kushner’s Security Clearance Is Up to Kelly.”

But there are some new, salacious-seeming details. Take, for instance, a 2020 email from an unidentified federal prosecutor alerting an unknown recipient that Trump had taken more trips on Epstein’s plane than was previously realized. There are at least two unvetted forms submitted in 2020 to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center tip line that mention Trump’s name in conjunction with alarming and unproven allegations, including rape and paying for sex.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about these new documents and allegations, and instead referred me to posts on X by the DOJ; Trump has previously denied any wrongdoing and has downplayed his past relationship with Epstein.

Another shocking revelation is a copy of a letter allegedly written by Epstein to Larry Nassar, a former U.S.-gymnastics-team doctor who was convicted of possessing child pornography, among other crimes, and who used his position to sexually abuse hundreds of women and girls. The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein’s death, in 2019, and makes a reference to suicide. “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” the letter, which appears to have been signed by Epstein, reads. “Good luck! We shared one thing … our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential.” The letter continues: “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system.” The existence of a letter sent by Epstein to Nassar had been previously reported by the Associated Press, but the contents had not been; earlier today, the DOJ posted on X that it had concluded that the Nasser letter was fake, which “serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual.”

These details alone are a lot to take in. That they are just a few needles of newsworthy information in a PDF haystack is dizzying. Blearily tabbing through the files at random this morning, I came across screenshots of what appear to be emails between prosecutors in Epstein’s 2008 sex-crimes case, which resulted in Epstein getting a cushy plea deal (almost all of the names in the email are redacted). I can think of no reason that the names of those who afforded him such an arrangement shouldn’t be made public. In one of the emails, from late May of that year, one person mentions an unnamed person, presumably Epstein, spending only 90 days in jail. “Please tell me you are joking,” the other replies. “Maybe we should throw him a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Such emails, although redaction-heavy, are the kind of information that journalists and investigators have longed for—they shed partial light on the government’s leniency in the case. Still, the release is piecemeal and difficult to comb through; as a result, it paints an unclear picture.

As is often the case online, the messy, public release has at times led to more confusion than clarity. On X this morning, I came across a viral post containing a screenshot of one of the FBI tips from the files that alleges that Trump and Epstein raped a woman. “Now we’re starting to see why Trump was hiding the Epstein files, and it probably gets much worse,” the post reads. Digging through the files, I’ve confirmed that the document is real, but the post—which currently has several million views—lacks crucial context. The allegations are not part of a court document or witness testimony; they’re transcribed from a 2020 call to the FBI tip line, and totally unconfirmed.

This is a sterling example of the informational chaos here. A disturbing, salacious tip, the credibility of which is completely unknown, printed on an official FBI form: It’s perfect fodder for screenshots, reposts, and accusations. The “information” looks terrible for Trump, but it’s presented without any burden of proof. That the DOJ would release something so potentially incendiary but redact other information, such as the names of government lawyers, only adds to the confusion.

The Epstein scandal has consumed Washington and dogged Trump’s second term, and the release of these latest files is textbook news dump: a massive tranche of individual image files and PDFs, collected with few discernible organizing details, dropped online just before the Christmas holiday. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Sunday that the partial, phased release is being done in part to protect victims. Although that could be the case, the drip-drop release has the added effect of being frustrating and overwhelming, stringing everyone along during a moment when fewer people are likely to be paying attention.

Ironically, the nature of the release also means that the story will not die. Today’s release has only fanned the flames of the conspiracy. It also fragments an important news story such that it becomes hard to get a good sense of where things stand. In one interpretation, it might feel like the walls are closing in for Trump and the White House, where an avalanche of anecdotal evidence—the infamous 50th-birthday-book release in September, a trove of emails in November that mention Trump and his onetime adviser Steve Bannon, last Friday’s release, today’s—is piling up. But seen another way, this release is also optimally confusing, muddying the waters with as-yet-unverified information that’s being disseminated via individual screenshots on social media, making the whole thing easier to dismiss.

There’s a secondary effect for those of us watching, which is that of being trapped in some kind of Epstein holiday purgatory. Family gatherings and Honey Baked Hams are colliding with the slow-burn proliferation of crime-scene evidence related to an alleged prolific sex trafficker who appears to have been close friends with the current president of the United States. Those following the Epstein saga closely are stuck waiting for the next shoe to drop; those with more normal news-consumption habits or who may wish to ignore the sordid affair may be forced to acknowledge it as nauseating details barge into their life while they scroll, channel surf, or talk with a politics-obsessed uncle at the dinner table.

This would be a small price to pay, if any true accountability were to come from this process. But much of the context of the Epstein files is that they are being released by a DOJ that, as my colleague David A. Graham wrote yesterday, has gone to great lengths to politicize itself in the second Trump administration. As Graham notes, the entire Epstein ordeal is a showcase of “compounding failures” by the federal government, from its slowness to act on tips about Epstein many years ago, to the plea deal in 2008, to this administration’s questioning of Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell and her move to a minimum-security prison this past summer. And then there is what the files continue to confirm: a moral rot in some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world. Combine these things, and the files are a recipe for inspiring potent distrust and resentment.

Those of us paying attention are, for now, stuck—bombarded with enough troubling information and allegations to assume the worst about this conspiracy, but also possessing enough earned cynicism and suspicion to assume that little will change.</div>

The holidays are a time for reflection, but lately I’ve been overthinking things: Over the past few weeks, I’ve listened to a playlist of my top songs via Spotify “Wrapped,” revisited my summer-long job hunt on LinkedIn’s Year in Review, and ruminated on my crossword abilities with The New York Times’ Year in Games feature. In 2025, there seem to be more of these data interpolators than ever: The event-planning service Partiful invites users to an After Party, revealing the people they socialized with the most this year. Your Year With ChatGPT lets us see how many em dashes we exchanged with AI. There’s also PlayStation’s Wrap-Up, Goodreads’ Year in Books, and Years in Review for Duolingo, Letterboxd, and Oura. Even Untappd, a social network for beer enthusiasts, has a year-end wrap-up called Recappd.

The wrap-up tradition has been around for a number of years, but what was once a cheeky bit of marketing has now expanded into a full-blown season of its own. In today’s internet landscape, personalization is the coin of the realm: Search results, on-site advertisements, and social feeds are all tailored to users’ precise desires based on their behaviors. During recap season, those behaviors themselves become the product. Data typically reserved for in-house analytics teams are suddenly interesting in and of themselves—and reviewing those data can be fun, until we’re reminded just how much we’re tracked, and just how valuable our data are to companies’ bottom line.

Because the market for year-end-data visualization has become so bloated, and because consumers now practically expect their digital habits to be condensed and repackaged, products and services that really needn’t be “wrapped” are being contorted into the format. For the past few years, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has issued a Metro Rewind, totaling commuters’ top bus and railway stops. The goal, according to a press release, is nothing less than “transforming each person’s transit history into a vivid, shareable snapshot that captures how you move across the region.” No data set is too mundane for this treatment: The cloud-storage service Google One sent out a Year in Review telling users how much of their allotted storage they’ve used up, and reminding them how long they’ve been subscribed.

But the year-end recaps that seem to work best are the ones that give people something they actually want. In the case of Spotify Wrapped, the promotional blitz is productive both for the company collecting the data and for the user. Wrapped is a glorified ad for Spotify’s ability to make money off its users’ data, but it also comes with a host of features that are actually useful. I look forward to Spotify Wrapped because it leaves me with a playlist full of my favorite songs of the year and lets me compare my songs against my friends’. But as more companies scramble to turn wonky user data into something slick and shareable, the utility and the joy get harder to see: Do we really need a readout of the Metro stops that our friends are visiting most frequently?

What it does reveal isn’t always enjoyable, either. I consider each order placed on a food-delivery app to be a personal failing on my part, but Uber Eats’ “YOUBER” attempts to celebrate those late-night moments of laziness and capitulation. At their best, personalized year-end recaps find the fun in data. But the story of a meal—even a memorable one shared with friends—can’t be told in flat numbers. And it’s a good thing that Strava’s Year in Sport is reserved for paying subscribers, since I know I’d bristle when confronted with all of the days I failed to run this year.

Spotify says that “your Wrapped is a reflection of you: unparalleled and unmistakably personal.” But the idea that such limited data can offer that level of access is a convenient fiction. These features can also reflect what users want them to: As recaps have become a yearly expectation, some people have found ways to alter their digital footprints, cherry-picking the kinds of media (books on Goodreads, movies on Letterboxd, music on Spotify) that might reflect refinement and taste when it comes time to share. “Just as the machine tailors itself to us, we try to tailor ourselves to it,” my colleague Nancy Walecki wrote in a 2023 reflection on Spotify Wrapped. Enthusiasts like to debate when exactly Spotify stops tracking user behavior, and which weeks out of the year might not count for the following year’s edition. This year, Spotify tracked listening habits from January to mid-November, which means it’s entirely possible that mid-November through December is unsurveilled time. “Safe months to listen to your guilty pleasures,” a Mashable article once called this indeterminate period.

In 2025, surveillance is no revelation. We choose to surrender our valuable data to certain apps because we accept that the products are worth it. And, in many cases, when those annual recaps arrive, we welcome them. But it helps when companies give us something to make those concessions a little easier to tolerate. Hence the bargain I make with Spotify each year. Still, I relish what little chance I get to evade the watchful eyes of these data collectors. We have another full week before the tracking for next year’s reviews kicks off—and then we’ll do it all over again.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

‘It’s Very Controversial, but I Love Nick Fuentes’

When I rode the escalator into the lobby of the Phoenix Convention Center on Thursday, one of the first things I saw was a two-story-tall picture of Charlie Kirk with his arm reaching out to the sky …

AmericaFest has long been one of the biggest events on the right, but this year, the conference saw a record turnout of roughly 30,000. When I asked attendees why they had decided to come, they invariably told me that they were there “because of Charlie.” Many of the most prominent influencers and politicians in MAGA world spoke at the event, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Donald Trump Jr., and Steve Bannon. Almost all invoked his memory onstage. When Speaker of the House Mike Johnson spoke of erecting a statue of Kirk in the United States Capitol, the crowd broke out into “Charlie” chants. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton compared Kirk to Jesus.

But during my four days at AmericaFest, I noticed that something else was also casting a shadow over the conference. Everyone had come to unite around Kirk, but they kept fighting about Nick Fuentes.

Take a look. Every story The Atlantic publishes includes art that provides readers with another lens through which they can understand and experience a given subject or idea. Here’s a collection of The Atlantic art department’s favorite images of the year.

Is the US viewpoint the &quot;only true viewpoint&quot; for the entire world?

Will it be fine if EU starts demanding that particular European views to be propagated within the US?

It&#39;s not even about the EU censoring anything. The only one from EU (the government part) is former commissioner Thierry Breton, who isn&#39;t barred for censorship (was never part of his duty), but for overseeing lawmaking and regulatory processes that Trump sees as unfavourable to US companies (e.g. Digital Markets and Digital Services Acts, the ones regularly called against practices of Apple or Meta). The others are heads of non-governmental organisations, i.e. not the EU by definition, and not doing censor

And three more steps away from trusting and reconnecting to the USA if and when Republicans are no longer in control.

Not understanding doesn&#39;t actually make it mystical, but when you pile lack of understanding upon more of the same, you can get to basically the same place in the end. After enough steps of not understanding you might as well be looking at magic, because you don&#39;t understand even the concepts you need to understand the idea you&#39;re thinking about.

With the way things are going, we don&#39;t need to worry about &#39;pictures for retards&#39; being added to text - we need to worry about them replacing text.

Some of us even use a web site that limits posts to using an eight-bit character set with only text-oriented markup.

Except it works in pretty much anything, including C.  Slashdot is one of last holdouts.

Try this, replacing U+1F4A9 with the actual symbol:int main() { int U+1F4A9=0; return U+1F4A9; }

To elaborate: the C standard never mandated any particular character set except for a basic &quot;portable subset&quot; smaller than ASCII; implementations could freely add more or less, possibly necessitating trigraphs.  Later revisions disambiguated what character classes can be used in identifiers and string constants, but in principle you were allowed any symbol supported by your platform since day one.

That&#39;s the standard; implementations differed.  In particular, GCC was hesitant to allow non-ASCII (in a bid to

If Rust can be added, than anything can be added.Emoji won&#39;t be as much of a security risk as Rust.

...if I could find one that would support :facepalm: emojis in comments.

Maybe those python guys can fix that spaces schema?

You might be onto something; replace the spaces with emojis.

That would be improvement. At least characters that are required to be there are not totally invisible and have some appearance so one can see if they are there or not and how many there are.

Swift allows emojis as valid var, const and func names.  And a few weeks ago there was a Slashdot (I think) story about AI &quot;written&quot; code that had been pasted in to a programme.  The return codes were emojis - sad face for error etc.

Python gets even worse: it uses WHITESPACE for syntax!

We all mix pictures, emojis, and text freely in our communications. No, we don&#39;t. Some of us still know that the purpose of communication is to convey information, not force the other party into a guessing game.

Back before there were Japanese style emoji, we made little faces out of ASCII characters. They conveyed a lot of information, such as the tone in which something was being said.

As for programming, syntax highlighting greatly improves readability, so I&#39;m not ruling out that certain emoji might too.

Yes, BBSers invented a useful thing to add to text communications so that people who weren&#39;t good language communicators could express emotion in online conversations conducted in ASCII. But we have keys for those characters. Inserting emoji means using additional software. Even on a phone it&#39;s irritating when you&#39;re inserting a little-used emoji and you have to go find it, and it gets more irritating as their number increases.

As for the comparison to syntax highlighting, it might well make sense for an IDE

Already using this &quot;additional software&quot;, because I use non-latin characters for Japanese language. Unicode is of course mandatory.

I had to educate one of my daughters on this very idea just the other day with its two implications. First, if you want to be understood, use the tools that best allow that.  And second, if you are too lazy to make that low-level effort, you are implicitly insulting the recipient of your message with the subtext that the effort they spend trying to figure out the meaning of what you wrote is less important than the miniscule time you saved.

For me, as someone whose professional career is built upon communica

What level of stupid, pointless, and literally useless idiocy is this?

Can we just ... not?  I know pols always need to &quot;do something.&quot; Dev managers...also yes.  But can the people writing the fking compilers just...NOT?

Ok, plan B.  If you&#39;re making a language that accepts emojis, it must ONLY accept emojis and classis operands.  No text.  Have kind kiddies. Let me know when you manage &#39;hello world&#39; while the rest of us do something - anything - vaguely more useful.

If you&#39;re going to allow Unicode, should you arbitrarily disallow certain ranges/glyphs because they&#39;re in a list of those assigned to emojis?Well, that&#39;s already the case. You cannot start an identifer with a &quot;number&quot; in many languages (C included). A &quot;number&quot; is an arbitrarily defined subset of all glyphs. Also, one might not use a &quot;whitespace&quot; in an identifier. Guess what a &quot;whitespace&quot; is? An arbitrarily defined subset of all glyphs.So what you are describing as utter nonsense is exactly what is going on under the scene right now with pretty much all languages.

emojis belong in comments,such as:# The following code is 100% reliable :-)

I could see that idiom appearing in lots of my code. :-(

Before suggesting them, I&#39;d say list out the use cases for them. I&#39;ve seen some suggestions, but none of them require adding anything to the programming languages themselves because they&#39;re about documentation which can (and should) be done separately from the programming language itself. Diagrams in documentation comments, for instance, merely requires Unicode in the comments and every language I know of supports that.

As a counter-argument, I&#39;d suggest looking at APL. It did just this, using a myriad of symbols for operators and keywords rather than conventional text like most languages. That produced a language that was concise, elegant and utterly unusable by 99% of developers (the remainder not-jokingly referred to it as a write-only language due to the difficulty of reading and understanding even your own code, let alone anyone else&#39;s). Before going this route, explain how you&#39;re going to prevent the multitude of difficulties apparent in APL first.

I&#39;ve only experienced two useful things about emojis scattered through text:1. It tells me that the text was written by an LLM (before the propter explicitly requests it to stop doing so).2. It also tells me that the text was potentially written by someone between the ages of 12 and 22 (and probably written by AI).

try :(
      confused face emojicatch
    poop emoji

that is what jumping the shark of coding will look like.

Back to APL with emojis, emoticons, and pictures; the  Kenneth E. Iverson language that used symbols to write code.

I’ve been making smiley emojis wink since the semicolon met the colon and the right parentheses on the typewriter.  Is that considered Shakespearean prose compared to the 3D make-my-face emoji of today?

Dunno what it looks like, but I’d imagine it should be accepted about as well as girl math at your local community bank.

I&#39;m all for using such systems to catch out those who are uninsured, no tax, no licence but logging movement just feels so intrusive and far beyond any need.

It would be nice if data would be deleted before it left the LPR, if it was considered irrelevent, or perhaps a series of encryption keys used so one body which requires judges to &quot;turn their keys&quot; to allow access be used, while LPR output fitting another criteria of vehicles which are not permitted on the road would be allowed  to be accessed with just the LEOs&#39; keys.  In any case, all data is tagged with an expiration date, where if there isn&#39;t an explicit legal hold, it gets flushed, on an encryption key

For those not in the know, Soviet -stans are somewhat unique in that they came in a region of islamic parts of Silk Road that were utterly primitive when Soviets rolled in. So primitive that they still had the early farming period style division between peoples. They had fairly modern islamic elite town dwellers, rural farmers and finally primitive nomads. Three peoples that didn&#39;t really meet outside raids/enslavement/murder in spite of living next to one another. Three life styles locked in constant existential conflict with two others.

So when Soviets arrived, these peoples fought each other in blood feuds going back millenia all the time. It was a stereotypical hell hole of primitive savagery.

So Soviets tried to civilize these people by giving them an idea of Communist man and a Communist state. It worked, more or less. Nomads were defined as &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; by Soviets and what they made into their nation is hilarious in that it&#39;s main two cities are mainly populated by other peoples because... well primitive nomads. They don&#39;t do the whole &quot;city living&quot; thing. They raid cities.

But Uzbeks are by far the best adapted ones. They were the agriculturalists in an incredibly fertile Ferghana valley. But to survive between constantly marauding and slaving nomads running around the edges of their valley and islamic township elites raping and enslaving from the other side, they had to create a hilariously insular and brutal culture.

They have a rather unique way of dealing with dissent in that they are to my knowledge the only people outside Africa who are known to have boiled people alive/drowned people in scalding water (reports differ on specifics) for political disagreements this century. This is not a too unusual thing in the Black Magic Belt of Africa where doing fucked up shit to people is a norm, but quite rare in Africa outside of it and unheard of outside Africa. Except Uzbekistan.

So yeah, monitoring license plates is not really relevant or interesting in comparison.

Turkmen were the islamic elites for those wondering, and they have their own -stan too. Led by a proper Caliph at this point in all but name, as an Islamic nation should be. That man makes Kim family look like paragons of liberalism and democracy. Fourth and final -stan being by far the largest, and something of an experiment in integrating everyone into a Russian society, which is why it&#39;s fundamentally two states in one and during early USSR was a part of Russian Federation. But it never really integrated. Its north is basically a state for Central Asian Russians, whereas south has a mix of all three original groups separated by a desert from the north.

To give you an idea of just how authoritarian post-Soviet -stans are, the most metropolitan, most Europeanized one with significant Russian population in the north? When its first president for life died, they renamed the capital after him. And that is indeed by far the most liberal of them.

P.S. It&#39;s worth noting that Turkmenistan&#39;s Berdimuhamedow is a living meme for this unironic publicity stunts, and a hilariously entertaining man to follow. Between having his government all do group aerobics to rebuilding his capital in white only because that&#39;s his lucky color, to doing rap songs with his grandson to thundering applause of entire theaters that would make Stalin himself blush, all of his horse related antics and his current push to become a &quot;spiritual leader of the nation&quot; he&#39;s an amazing source of laughs if you&#39;re a Westerner. I really recommend &quot;chronicles of Turkmenistan&quot;, they have an amazing youtube channel where they just collect clips from Turkmenistan&#39;s national TV and cut them with hilarious music into short videos.

https://en.hronikatm.com/about... [hronikatm.com]

(Site may have an expired certificate, they don&#39;t maintain it all that well).

The premise of this article makes no sense at all.  Why would Uzbekistan need LPR cameras to track citizens when everyone is already carrying personal tracking devices in the form of smartphones?

You can spend a million dollars and years of your time to surface new facts previously unknown to humanity and then turn around and disclose them in your own book.

Someone else can read your book and disclose the same facts to the world for free or in their own book.  This really sucks for the person who spent all that time and effort and it certainly isn&#39;t fair.  It also has absolutely nothing to do with copyright law.

You can make the case on the front end about illegal copying of fixed works for training..

The problem is that they&#39;re doing it wrong, they should have opted out of the class, and filed a notice of appeal with regards to the judge&#39;s findings on the law, rather than try to relitigate what the law is, when that is going to be barred by collateral estoppel / res judicata.

From the Statue of Liberty to the Golden Gate Bridge, and places in between like Yellowstone and the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the National Park Service has been a point of American pride since its inception. And with a small budget and actually generating revenue, even fiscal hawks had no reason to complain.

So why is the Trump administration cutting their budget?

The Supreme Court dealt a rare and remarkable defeat to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, blocking his deployment of the National Guard to assist immigration agents in Chicago. By a 6–3 vote, the court held that Trump’s federalization of the Guard was likely unlawful, with the majority severely restricting the president’s broader authority to deploy troops for domestic law enforcement. The decision constitutes a significant setback for the administration’s efforts to flood blue cities with National Guard members; it also arguably marks Trump’s biggest Supreme Court defeat since his return to office, with major implications for other aspects of his agenda that go beyond the conservative legal movement’s long-standing priorities.

Tuesday’s ruling in Trump v. Illinois caps off, for now, a clash between federal and state authority with the potential to set off a genuine constitutional crisis. It began in October, when Trump deployed members of the Illinois and Texas National Guards to Chicago to help out with Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration enforcement initiative. The president claimed that both residents and local law enforcement were obstructing the operation, necessitating federalization of the Guard. He ordered Guard members to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection as they engaged in a campaign of brutality and terror against Latino communities. Chicago and Illinois both sued, and a federal judge ruled that Trump’s use of the Guard was probably unlawful. An appeals court agreed, prompting the Justice Department to seek relief from SCOTUS.

The parties’ dispute centered on a federal statute that lets the president deploy the Guard when he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” Chicago asserted that, as a factual matter, Trump could still execute the law; the Justice Department claimed he could not. But after a few weeks of silence, the justices declined to resolve this fact-bound question; instead, they sought additional briefing on a different issue: the meaning of “regular forces.” The DOJ thought the phrase meant federal law enforcement, like ICE and CBP, and Chicago acquiesced to that reading at SCOTUS. But the justices seemed unsure in light of an amicus brief filed by Georgetown Law professor Marty Lederman that argued it meant the military, not police.

On Tuesday, the court formally sided with Lederman, ruling sharply against the Trump administration. It concluded that “regular forces,” as used in the statute, “likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military.” And, of course, Trump had not tried to quell the alleged crisis in Chicago with the military; instead, he went straight to the National Guard. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined with the three liberals to rule against him on that basis. That lopsided outcome is extraordinary on its own.

But Roberts and Barrett then joined with the liberals to go even further. This 5–4 majority held that the relevant statute applies “only where the military could legally execute the laws.” And “such circumstances,” they noted, are “exceptional,” because the president is broadly forbidden from deploying the military for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. There are a few narrow exceptions—namely, the Insurrection Act, which applies only during an insurrection, invasion, or complete breakdown of civilian law enforcement. But outside those extreme scenarios—which no party has yet argued are present in Chicago—the military may not “execute the laws” of the United States. And that, the majority explained, means the National Guard may not “execute the laws in Illinois,” either.

Kavanaugh refused to embrace this broader holding, warning that it would unduly limit the president’s control over the armed forces during “future crises.” He insisted that the president must have more discretion to deploy the Guard when he is practically unable to send in the military. Kavanaugh’s position would carve a pretty glaring loophole into the majority’s holding: It would allow the president to simply announce that he cannot call in the “regular forces” for some practical reason, then summon the National Guard instead.

That workaround would neuter the majority’s broader message, which seems to be that the president can’t make up some reason why he needs the military, then federalize Guard members because it’s more convenient. By forcing the president to call on the military as a first resort for domestic law enforcement—then reminding him that he can very rarely do so lawfully—the majority sharply restricted his use of any troops in American streets. It is unclear if Kavanaugh agrees with this bottom line. (In a footnote, the justice also appeared to walk back his notorious September opinion insisting that immigration agents may engage in racial profiling, which greenlit so-called Kavanaugh stops; he wrote on Tuesday that, actually, officers “must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity.”)

Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, is most notable for its total lack of self-awareness. Alito complained that the majority decided the case with “scant briefing and no oral argument,” when he himself has joined innumerable decisions in favor of Trump that were decided the exact same way. He also suggested that his colleagues imperiled the lives of immigration agents, writing: “Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted.” Yet courts have consistently found that the Trump administration has exaggerated or fabricated threats to these officers; it is, in fact, the officers themselves who have engaged in the most disturbing acts of violence. (Justice Neil Gorsuch’s brief dissent objected to the rapid resolution of such “fraught” questions on a “highly compressed schedule”—though he, too, has regularly joined shadow docket orders that resolved equally weighty questions in Trump’s favor.)

Why, after handing so many victories to the Trump administration over the last year, did the court draw the line here? There are two obvious answers. First, most of the prior cases involved legal issues long settled within the conservative legal movement. Roberts, Barrett, and Kavanaugh have spent their whole careers arguing for the president’s power to fire executive officials. But the Federalist Society has not reached a consensus on the president’s authority to send troops into American cities; to the contrary, its emphasis on federalism might seem to counsel against this sweeping claim of power. Trump’s agenda and the Supreme Court’s priorities may be starting to diverge, with the president pushing some conservative justices far out of their comfort zones and into uncharted territory. These are the cases where the center of the court may be inclined to draw a line.

Second, the National Guard cases have, in the lower courts, devolved into a furious dispute over the facts. The Trump administration keeps getting caught lying about the alleged violence against ICE, leading some judges to argue that he should lose because he is, as a matter of demonstrable reality, able to “execute the laws” without help from the armed forces. By adopting Lederman’s reading, the Supreme Court sidestepped this debate, ruling against Trump without having to call him a liar. The justices clearly did not want to get sucked into this increasingly acerbic and inherently political discourse.

Still, this conflict is far from over. One irony of the court’s decision is that it gives Trump a reason to go nuclear and invoke the Insurrection Act, which really does allow him to send in the military for domestic law enforcement. That law only applies during insurrection, rebellion, or a complete breakdown of state police, none of which is present in Chicago or anywhere else in the U.S. Tuesday’s ruling—with its marked skepticism toward Trump’s deployment of troops at home—suggests that the majority would not approve an invocation of the act on this record. But as Kavanaugh flagged in an ominous footnote, the matter remains unresolved. So that battle looms in the distance. Right now, though, it is just a relief to know that there is still a limit to SCOTUS’ indulgence of this administration’s abuses of power.

The good news about President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new “Trump-class battleship,” based on his own vision of what a modern war vessel should look like, is that it will almost certainly never be built.

The bad news is that, over the next few years, the Navy will spend hundreds of millions of dollars—maybe even a few billion—pretending that it’s working on the project.

Nobody in the Navy has asked for a new battleship of this sort—a behemoth weighing three times as much as the vessel it replaces (which itself is a very heavy ship), staffed by twice as many personnel (recruited from where?), and hoisting every type of weapon imaginable, including nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which, to the relief of every Navy commander, no U.S. surface vessel has carried since the end of the Cold War.

Quite apart from the megalomania of a president naming a warship after himself, the project contradicts a growing consensus among naval analysts for building and dispersing a larger number of smaller, less vulnerable ships. Given that the Chinese navy now has more ships than the U.S. Navy (370 vs. 294) and, more important, hundreds of anti-ship ballistic missiles, which can strike our ships from 900 miles away, the Trump-class battleship is simply wrongheaded for the modern era: It would heighten the U.S. Navy’s already-stressed vulnerabilities at sea.

In a news conference at Mar-a-Lago where the project was announced, Trump—standing next to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio—said he would push the Navy to build the first of the new ships in two-and-a-half years, i.e., before his term is up. (He envisions building 20 to 25 of the ships in all.)

Several retired Navy officers and weapons analysts (including two that I interviewed, who requested anonymity in order to avoid retribution) see this as a pipe dream. The newest Burke-class destroyer ships take about five years to build—and they are much smaller and based on existing designs. To design, construct, weaponize, and deploy a much larger ship based on an entirely new concept would likely take a decade.

The retired officer and naval analyst estimate the first of these ships would likely cost about $10 billion, four times that of the newest Burke destroyer—and that’s not counting the cost of the weapons onboard.

Those weapons are another problem. According to Trump and to subsequent information released by the Navy, much of it compiled by the private research group GlobalSecurity.org, the new ship would carry a lot of new, as-yet-unproven types of armaments, including hypersonic missiles, laser weapons, and an as-yet-undecided power source. Testing all these new weapons, and then integrating them all on one platform, is a very complex task.

The retired admiral told me that the Navy’s most successful project in recent decades is the Aegis-class cruiser. Started in the late 1970s, it works well, and was efficiently built, because it put together existing elements—the Navy’s best missiles, fire-control system, and air defenses—all already-proven. The only new element was an air-defense radar.

By contrast, the much newer Zumwalt-class destroyer, contracted in 2002, tried to integrate lots of new technologies, and it was a disaster. The Navy had planned to build 32 of those ships, but, owing to various delays and cost overruns, ended up building just three.

The same is likely to happen with the Trump-class battleships, if any ever get built at all.

One other problem: The United States just doesn’t have the shipbuilding capacity for this project. The retired admiral and the naval analyst told me the shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, is the only one capable of building a boat this big. Yet it is also where the next aircraft carrier is being built. Which vessel will get priority? There is neither the space nor the workforce to build both.

Finally, it is unclear just what this ship is supposed to do. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said at Mar-a-Lago that the USS Defiant—the name of the first Trump-class ship—“will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.”

But what if it has to fight in a war? Ships mobilize as part of a battle group. Will the USS Defiant help protect the aircraft carrier, along with the various frigates, cruisers, and destroyers? Will it assist the aircraft carrier in projecting power against the enemy? Will it be the “flagship”—the lead vessel—in its own group? These aren’t small questions. The answers will shape the training of the ship’s crews and even, to some degree, its design.

The announcement that the ship will also carry nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles came as a particular surprise. No U.S. surface vessel has carried nukes since the end of the Cold War. President George H.W. Bush ordered them removed back in 1991—and not just for dovish reasons. Not only had the nukes made those ships a more tempting target, they were more trouble than they were worth, requiring specially trained crews and special security procedures. Those ships were also barred from entering the waters and ports of many U.S. allies. I was a defense reporter when Bush made this decision. Every Navy officer I knew heaved a huge sigh of relief. I doubt many of today’s officers want to return to the old era.

Trump has mulled none of this. He first raised the subject back on Sept. 30, in his address before hundreds of generals and admirals at Quantico, Virginia. In the middle of a rambling speech, touching on dozens of topics, he said:

I think we should maybe start thinking about battleships, by the way. … I used to watch Victory at Sea [a documentary about World War II naval battles]. I love Victory at Sea. I look at these admirals, it’s got to be your all-time fave, in black and white. When I look at those ships … man, nothing was going to stop. … They were 20 deep, and they were in a straight line, and there was nothing going to stop them. … They don’t make [ships] that way anymore, but … I’m sort of open to it.

In other words, even aside from its name, the Trump-class battleship is all about Trump—his fantasy-fed nostalgia, feeding his notion that, as the smartest man in the room on any and all subjects, he has the slightest idea how any of this works.

He also likes the looks of this ship, claiming that he was involved in its design. “I’m a very aesthetic person,” he said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference. He has always been impressed by looks; recall his tendency, especially in his first term, to pick Cabinet secretaries because they looked straight out of “central casting.” To him, everything is a show.

Back in his first term, Trump asked the top Navy admirals to come to the White House to talk about ships. A friend of one of those officers, now also a retired admiral, recalls being told that Trump put up pictures of various U.S. ships, criticizing them all as ugly. Then he put up a picture of, the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.

“Now there’s a good-looking ship!” Trump exclaimed.

One of the admirals replied that it might look good, but it wouldn’t last five minutes in a battle at sea. And in fact, the Ukrainian navy sank the Moskva in April 2022, just weeks after the start of that war.

The Trump-class USS Defiant might be good-looking, if it ever sees life on a shipyard. But if it steams into battle, it might meet the same fate as the Moskva.

            <h2>The Real Reason the MAGA Coalition Is Breaking</h2>

In something of a Christmas miracle, the MAGA coalition may finally be starting to break down.

The Heritage Foundation, which published the Project 2025 blueprint for this Trump term, just saw more than a dozen staff members defect for former Vice President Mike Pence’s Advancing American Freedom think tank; turncoats include the former leaders of Heritage’s data, economics, and legal teams. Among prominent MAGA leaders—mostly elected officials, people who want to be elected officials, and podcasters—there is a growing divide over what one might assume should be an easily answered question: Should they welcome Nazis, avowed white supremacists, and unrepentant racists hurling slurs into the movement?

This is apparently quite the conundrum. It’s also telling that the cleavage is coming now. After all, the movement Donald Trump built has long welcomed bigots and racists; Trump himself dined with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and enthusiastic antisemite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, although he later claimed to not know who Fuentes was. The people who have gotten into bed with the president, whether they’re D.C. think tank staffers or Jan. 6 hooligans, realized who they were cozying up with.

That some are starting to object and defect suggests that two things are happening at once. The first is that MAGA bigotry has gotten significantly broader, expanding beyond the groups the broader right believes are acceptable to malign (women, Black people, immigrants, Muslims) and coming for groups of which prominent MAGA leaders are a part (Jews, Indians, anyone whose ancestors didn’t come over on the Mayflower). The second is that Trump himself is fading: He’s elderly and showing the typical signs of fatigue and cognitive decline. This is creating something of a vacuum in leadership. Vice President J.D. Vance is the clear MAGA heir apparent (or at least believes himself to be). But he won’t take the throne unchallenged. Some of these contenders want to sit in the Oval Office, and there can be only one butt in the chair behind the Resolute Desk. Others want a different kind of Republican Party: Some strive to turn away from Trumpian populism and toward a tax-cutting pro-business agenda; others aim for a return to the politics of conservative Christianity, with a refocus on restricting abortion and LGBTQ+ rights; a few really may object to MAGA’s blood-and-soil nationalist turn. But the coalition is currently fracturing for one reason: The leader is weak, and a successor is being chosen.

The growing objections to MAGA racism can feel pretty rich coming from people who seemed just fine with many kinds of racism up until now. But it’s also true that MAGA racism has, like the famous “First they came for” poem, proved itself insatiable. Vance has been among the leading voices for the idea that there is a category of “heritage Americans,” a very-online term for people whose family ancestry supposedly gives them more of a claim to legitimate Americanness than anyone else: naturalized citizens, children of immigrants, someone whose grandparents immigrated after World War II. If your ancestors came over anytime after 1789, you are not a “Grade A” American, as one chart puts it. “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” Vance has said—marking those who chose to become American as having a less legitimate right to Americanness than those who fought to break up the country.

This turn has alarmed many conservatives who, like most Americans, are not purely descended from Pilgrims. The elevation of unapologetically antisemitic rhetoric and the growing hatred of Jews among Gen Z conservatives seem to have also spooked some MAGA loyalists. A recent Manhattan Institute focus group of Gen Z conservatives found them praising Adolf Hitler as a “great leader” and understanding “where he was coming from as far as wanting to improve the national state of Germany.” One young man who also said that Jews are a “force for evil” explained: “I’m very pro–strong executive, –strong leader, –strongman. I support national sovereignty, and Hitler was a nationalist. He was like, ‘We have to take Germany back for Germans.’ And I feel like we should do that in America.” A leaked chat among Young Republican leaders showed them joking about the Holocaust, calling Black people monkeys, and saying, “I love Hitler.” Young voters generally hold more antisemitic views than older ones, and young conservatives are, on average, the most antisemitic of all. This may be because young people are getting much of their political news from outrage-amplifying social media, as well as from “influencers” with popular podcasts, TikTok accounts, and YouTube and Discord channels, and many right-wing influencers have seen that racism, sexism, and antisemitism drive traffic—which in turn drives fans to be even more bigoted and reactionary. Candace Owens recently went on an extended antisemitic tirade, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Fuentes have also entertained antisemitic conspiracy theories or flat-out blamed the Jews for various problems. And the Trump administration is putting people with long records of antisemitism into top positions.

This seems to be an inflection point even for some notorious bigots and people who didn’t mind when the president called Somalis “garbage” and compared immigrants with insects. Laura Loomer is one of the country’s most notorious Muslim-haters (she has called Islam a “cancer” and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to hold political office) and acted as if getting banned from Twitter for hate speech was as bad as being sent to the gulags. But now she is suddenly in favor of gatekeeping, enforcing basic standards, and “moral clarity.” Former presidential contender and current candidate for governor of Ohio Vivek Ramaswamy, who during his 2024 campaign claimed that “our diversity is not our strength,” compared prominent Black progressives with the Ku Klux Klan and asserted that he had never seen or met “the boogeyman white supremacist” in America—“Maybe I’ll meet a unicorn sooner,” he added, “and maybe those exist too”—also seems to have changed his tune. “If you believe that Hitler was pretty fucking cool, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement,” Ramaswamy recently said. “If you call Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States of America, a ‘j—t,’ you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.”

J.D. Vance, whose Indian American wife Usha has been called racial slurs by right-wing racists, said that people who target her specifically can “eat shit” but that otherwise the GOP should be a big tent. “When I say that I’m going to fight alongside of you, I mean all of you—each and every one,” the vice president said at Turning Point USA’s recent AmericaFest. “President Trump did not build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless self-defeating purity tests.”

As the Nazis vs. Say-No-to-Nazis fissures broke open at the Turning Point event, conservatives on all sides of the debate laid claim to the legacy of their martyred leader Charlie Kirk. Some argued that he was a free-speech fanatic who would have welcomed everyone to TPUSA events even if they were wearing a T-shirt bearing a pro-Holocaust meme (“Let ’Em Cook”). Others agreed with Loomer’s take, that “people want to pretend like [Kirk’s] events were a free for all so they have an excuse to not call out the GOP’s Nazi problem.” Vance positioned himself on Team “Let ’Em Cook.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, seems to be with him: He caused major outcry after he defended Carlson having a very friendly interview with Holocaust denier Fuentes, in which Fuentes complained about the domination of “organized Jewry” and Carlson noted his belief that “Christian Zionists” have been “seized by this brain virus.”

The former Heritage staffers who have decamped for the new organization seem to be on Team Moral Clarity—or perhaps a team for which they don’t have to play ball with Nazis or the kinds of people who would attend a Turning Point USA convention. (That the organization they flocked to belongs to Pence—remember him? The guy the Jan. 6 rioters wanted to lynch on the White House lawn?—only adds to the sense that this cleavage runs deep.) In a not-so-long-ago iteration of the Republican Party, those who spoke and acted like Loomer, Owens, and even Kirk were the riffraff—part of the base, sure, but inconvenient and merely dog-whistled at to encourage loyalty. Now, though, they’re leading the pack, and not only when it comes to MAGA’s young pups.

It’s worth noting that in all of this, Trump is largely absent. Perhaps those closest to him see what average Americans do not: that his abilities, and with them his power, are waning. He turned the party into a cult of personality, in which the only ideology was to line up behind Donald Trump. The GOP rule “Whatever Trump wants, Trump gets” was so clear that the party stopped writing out policy platforms, instead issuing a one-page fealty pledge to its unquestioned leader. No one has the audacity to try to unseat him, or even to say that he won’t be in charge forever. MAGA stalwarts still wear their Trump 2028 hats, make Trump-as-Jesus fan art, share the triumphant photo of him raising his fist after surviving an assassin’s bullet, and believe that his 2024 win was a political resurrection divinely ordained to save America. Maybe Trumpism will never die. But clearly those around him can smell decay.

Craig Copetas had one of the most colorful beats in journalism: He wrote about the illegal drug trade for High Times magazine. “Dealers would search me out, asking me to go to Latin America to write adventure stories about them,” he told me. Another time, a guy opened up a small suitcase to give Copetas a peek at what he was holding: $1.5 million in cash.

That show-and-tell happened in December 1977, in the District of Columbia. It was a big weekend for drugs in the nation’s capital. “Everyone was coming to Washington,” Copetas remembered. “Smugglers, adventurers, scientists, musicians, lawyers, farmers, dealers, global leaders. And all of them were coming with some of the most rootin’-tootin’, scientifically produced cavalcade of recreational drugs you could imagine. And they were bringing it down in bulk.”

The occasion was a weekend conference put on by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, more commonly known as NORML. For NORML and its allies, 1977 had been an amazing year. Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina all passed decriminalization laws. And the new man in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, was urging Congress to do the same thing on a national level.

Growing, smoking, and possessing marijuana was still illegal pretty much everywhere in the United States. But by 1977, more than half of Americans under 30 had tried pot. NORML’s liberal drug agenda was winning. And now it was time to revel in all that success.

The weekend’s most extravagant event was the NORML Christmas party, held in a town house near Dupont Circle. There was a rock band, strobe lights, and a juggler. Silver trays got passed from guest to guest, some loaded down with caviar and others with joints packed with hand-cultivated marijuana.

The night was a crucial showcase for one man: Keith Stroup, the founder of NORML.

In 1977 he was 33 years old, and he answered to the nickname Mr. Marijuana. At the Christmas party, he strolled around in a blue velvet dinner jacket and burgundy bow tie, chatting up friends, colleagues, and potential funders under a haze of marijuana smoke. “Part of the thrill of being there was it was so goddamn out in the open,” he said.

Not long after 10 p.m., a guest showed up who demanded his full attention: Peter Bourne. He was the president’s top adviser on drug policy, and a man who could potentially change everything for Stroup’s movement.

Stroup was surprised and thrilled to see Bourne at the front door. The United States drug czar had turned up for a weed extravaganza. And he hadn’t dropped by to narc on anyone or to shut the whole thing down.

When it came to marijuana, Stroup and Bourne were on the same team. They believed both that America’s drug laws were horribly screwed up and that they were the people to fix them.

But that was before the NORML Christmas party. That night did end up changing everything for pot in America, but not in the way anyone expected.

Last week, almost five decades later, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to hasten the reclassification of marijuana as a Schedule 3 drug. That move would put weed in the same tier as Tylenol with codeine, loosening restrictions on research into the drug’s medical benefits. It will also be a step in the direction of full federal decriminalization or even legalization.

It all might have happened a long time ago if not for that Christmas party in 1977. The drug-fueled gathering turned out to be a turning point for Stroup and Bourne, for the Carter presidency, and for the future of marijuana.

This story was adapted from an episode of the One Year podcast. Evan Chung was the lead producer. Madeline Ducharme was the assistant producer. Listen to the full version:

The first time “Mr. Marijuana” Keith Stroup took a hit from a joint, he wasn’t sure he’d gotten high. What he did know is that the pizza he ate that night tasted “exceptionally good.”

It was the 1960s, and Stroup was at Georgetown Law School, in Washington. Back then, his main concern was avoiding the Vietnam War. He thought about getting a psychiatrist to say that he was gay, which would’ve disqualified him from the armed forces, but his wife vetoed that idea. In the end, he steered clear of military service by getting a government job.

Stroup worked for the National Commission on Product Safety. As a lawyer for the agency, he learned to do the sort of consumer advocacy made famous by Ralph Nader. In 1970 Stroup decided to put his own spin on that kind of work: He was going to lobby for marijuana smokers, just as Nader took up for consumers.

At first, Stroup’s National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws got treated as a curiosity. But he was tireless and charismatic, and he knew what he wanted to achieve. His goal was to make weed legal everywhere in the U.S. In the meantime, he pushed for a smaller, more practical step: decriminalization.

The country’s harsh marijuana laws dated back to the early 20th century, when they’d been enacted to target Black and Mexican Americans. As the demographics of marijuana users changed, so did the drug’s reputation. In 1969 Life magazine published photos of white professionals in cocktail attire toking up.

“If young, otherwise law-abiding, and essentially white people were going to start using this drug in greater numbers, people felt that they didn’t want to then burden these individuals with a criminal record,” said Emily Dufton, the author of Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America. “ ‘You know, this person is probably going to go on to have a family and a white picket fence. And do we really want to destroy their future for a little bit of harmless fun?’ ”

Still, harmless or not, marijuana was illegal. And if you got caught in the wrong place doing the wrong thing, the consequences could be extremely severe, with some people getting life sentences for marijuana-only crimes.

Plenty of Americans believed that small-time marijuana offenders weren’t really offenders at all. And so, under the right circumstances, the country might’ve been on a path to decriminalization in the late 1960s and early ’70s. But there was one very important person standing in the way.

Richard Nixon saw marijuana as a tool of his enemies: liberals, young people, and Vietnam protesters. And in Nixon’s America, those enemies needed to be policed. In 1970 he signed the federal Controlled Substances Act, which put drugs into five different categories, or schedules. The most restrictive category, Schedule 1, was for drugs that were totally outlawed, even for medical use. Among them were heroin, LSD, and marijuana.

Marijuana’s placement in Schedule 1 had to be reviewed by a commission. Given that this group was stacked with Nixon appointees, the president thought it would rubber-stamp his anti-marijuana position. But when all those Nixon appointees weighed the evidence, they did something surprising: They said marijuana wasn’t actually that bad. The commission recommended that both possession of marijuana for personal use and nonprofit distribution of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.

Nixon hated those recommendations, and so he decided to ignore them. He kept marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which it still is today. (Trump’s executive order finally looks poised to change that.)

But Nixon wasn’t all-powerful. Lawmakers across the country read the commission’s report and found it persuasive. “They began realizing that they had the capacity to change marijuana laws on the local level, and that’s what began to happen,” Dufton said.

Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana, in 1973. By 1976, six more states had done it, and a bunch of others looked as if they were moving in that direction. But for American marijuana policy to get remade, the federal government would have to be on board. There would need to be a new voice in Washington, someone with liberal views who was savvy enough to wield real political power. Someone like future drug czar Peter Bourne.

Years before he showed up at that fateful Washington party, Peter Bourne served as a doctor in Vietnam. During his stint in the military, Bourne discovered that American soldiers were finding solace in heroin. When his tour of duty was over, the Englishman moved to California and saw the dark aftermath of the Summer of Love. In San Francisco in the late 1960s, he helped set up the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. “That exposed me to widespread drug use of all kinds,” he told me.

In the early ’70s, Bourne moved to Atlanta to run a methadone clinic. He saw it as his chance to save lives. “Our goal was to have a situation where no heroin addict could say, ‘I want treatment, but there’s nowhere I can go to get it,’ ” he said.

Bourne and his clinic caught the attention of Georgia’s new governor, Jimmy Carter. Back then, Carter was an obscure figure, but Bourne believed in him. He was the first person to tell Carter that he should run for president.

Carter and Bourne became extremely close. During the 1976 presidential campaign, the governor said that Bourne was “about the closest friend I have in the world.” When Bourne talked about drugs, Carter listened. And Bourne made his views very clear. “More than anything else, people were dying in large numbers from heroin,” he said, “and you had 40 million people in the country using marijuana and nobody dying from it.”

Bourne believed that every dollar spent enforcing marijuana laws was a dollar taken away from work that really mattered. And he convinced Carter that he was right. During the 1976 campaign, Carter came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization. This was a big statement—the most liberal position on marijuana ever taken by a major-party presidential nominee.

While Carter didn’t personally approve of pot, he was no Richard Nixon. He hung out with weed-loving musicians like Willie Nelson and the Allman Brothers, and he didn’t think that everyone under 30 was plotting to destroy America.

Carter’s victory that fall marked a huge shift in U.S. politics—the end of the Nixon era, and a fresh start after Watergate and Vietnam. And Bourne had lots of ideas about how he could help his closest friend. Bourne advocated for national health insurance, and he put together a plan to end world hunger. He also talked to Carter about sending rockets to Mars.

All of that was outside Bourne’s purview. What he could do was change the country’s drug policy. Bourne’s official title was “special assistant to the president for mental health and drug abuse.” One of the people he met with was Keith Stroup. “We had so much to gain by maintaining that relationship, with Peter being so close to the president himself and so powerful in terms of drug policy,” Stroup said.

When Stroup founded NORML, he struggled to get big players to take him seriously. Now, with Carter in the White House, he became a Washington insider. Stroup smoked weed with the president’s son Chip, and he bonded with administration officials. “When the Allman Brothers were going to play a concert here in D.C., I would actually ride out to the concert with a group of White House people in a bus they had chartered,” Stroup told me. “Most of the time, we were smoking on the bus going out and smoking on the bus coming home.”

Stroup was a stoner who thought everyone in America should be free to enjoy the benefits of marijuana. Bourne was a doctor who thought that marijuana was trivial and the government should focus its resources on heroin. But from those different starting points, Mr. Marijuana and the drug czar ended up in the same place. In March 1977, Bourne told Congress that the administration “will continue to discourage marijuana use, but we feel criminal penalties that brand otherwise law-abiding people for life are neither an effective nor an appropriate deterrent.”

At times, it sounded as if the White House’s talking points on marijuana had been written by Keith Stroup. And in 1977, that actually happened.

One day, Stroup got a phone call from a junior White House speechwriter, who said that he was working on a presidential statement about marijuana policy. He asked Stroup if he’d like to come by and help him draft it. “And of course, I almost kill myself running to his place,” Stroup said.

Stroup’s most aggressive pro-pot language got edited out of that statement. But a lot of his material remained intact, including these lines:

Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marijuana in private for personal use.

The biggest headline coming out of that statement was that Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization—the first time a sitting president had ever done so. In some ways, it was just symbolic, because Carter wasn’t proposing a specific bill. But coming from the president and his drug czar, that symbolism was important.

A fundamental shift in American marijuana policy felt tantalizingly close. Bourne believed that the administration was going to get progressive legislation passed in Congress. Stroup thought that “within three or four or five years, we would have decriminalization passed in all states across the country.”

But there was another movement getting started around that same time—one that Bourne and Stroup did not see coming. It was led by two moms from Georgia.

In 1976 Marsha Keith Schuchard and her husband hosted their daughter’s 13th birthday party. There were about 20 kids in her backyard. “They asked if we could go upstairs, which we did,” she said. “And then my husband started seeing lights, like cigarette lights, going on all over. … And he went down to see what was happening, and it wasn’t cigarettes. It was joints. It was booze. And it was quite a shock.”

Schuchard doesn’t fit the stereotype of a drug warrior. She has a doctorate in English, and she identifies as a liberal Democrat. Living in Atlanta in the ’60s and ’70s, she fought for voting rights and school desegregation. But when Schuchard caught her daughter smoking pot, she found a new cause.

Schuchard called herself a “do-it-yourself drug-abuse professional.” She believed that parents could fight back against drug culture by sharing tips and resources and creating a supportive and safe community.

“They set uniform rules for all of their kids. They weren’t allowed to read High Times magazine. They had a curfew,” said Dufton, who wrote about Schuchard in her book Grass Roots. And in the parents’ eyes, those rules seemed to work.

The neighborhood kids called them the Nosy Parents Association. By 1977, Schuchard had brought her nosiness nationwide, co-founding the Parents’ Resource Institute for Drug Education. “What Schuchard was tapping into was that these were legitimate fears that a lot of people were having about their kids, but no one was speaking to it,” Dufton said.

Adolescent marijuana usage was on the rise in the mid-1970s, and pro-pot messages were everywhere. In magazines like High Times, Head, and Stone Age; on Saturday Night Live and in movies like The Groove Tube and Car Wash; and in Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It” and Neil Young’s “Homegrown.” And it was getting easier every day to find a shop that carried pipes and rolling papers.

In Atlanta, Schuchard’s friend Sue Rusche had promised her kids she’d buy them a Star Wars record. When they walked into the record store, what they found instead was a glass display case full of “Star Wars–like bongs.” Rusche went to more stores, and found more kid-friendly products: a Frisbee that was also a hash pipe, and a book called Tots Who Toke. “I know the power of advertising. I learned it in graphic design school,” Rusche told me. “And to think that people would target children was just inexplicable and abhorrent.”

The idea that pot was endangering impressionable, vulnerable children was a potent political message. In 1977 Schuchard and Rusche were starting to spread it. Whenever they spoke to parents groups, they’d bring along what they called the “bong show.” “The first thing we did was show them what the paraphernalia looked like and suggest that they try to find it in their community, and they always did,” Rusche said.

NORML’s Stroup had not accounted for any of this when he made his push for decriminalization. And when the parents from Atlanta started to get traction, he still didn’t think they were a real threat.

“Their philosophy was: If it’s unsafe for kids, then you shouldn’t legalize it. And of course, that’s a stupid standard,” Stroup said. “If that was the standard, adults couldn’t drive or fly airplanes or have sex. I thought because that premise was so wrongheaded that we didn’t have to worry about them.”

It was always unlikely that Mr. Marijuana and the nosy parents would find common ground. But Schuchard thought she might have a chance to win over the drug czar.

She got an audience with Peter Bourne in December 1977, at a conference on drug abuse. She told him about middle schoolers smoking pot, and she pulled out a bag of marijuana publications that she’d bought at a suburban shopping mall. Bourne listened to what she had to say and looked at what she’d brought. And the drug czar was totally unmoved. Schuchard said that he was “indifferent, rude, dismissive.”

Bourne was similarly unimpressed. He told me that the parents “didn’t know anything about drug abuse” and “couldn’t explain their position in any sort of public-health terms.” When I asked Bourne if he thought it was legitimate to be concerned about 13-year-olds smoking marijuana, he said that it didn’t bother him that much—that “when you compare it to more than 1,000 dying each month from heroin, it’s a misplacement of priorities.”

So that’s where Stroup and Bourne were in December 1977: entrenched in their positions, confident in their success, and unafraid to antagonize their opponents. What they didn’t realize was that they were about to make enemies with each other. And it would all start at the Christmas party.

NORML’s annual conference in D.C. featured seminars on marijuana and the law, marijuana and science, and marijuana and women. There were also plenty of opportunities to get a more practical education on the American drug scene.

“Wherever we went that weekend, people were coming up to us and offering us drugs,” remembered Craig Copetas of High Times magazine. “It was like backstage at a Rolling Stones concert.”

That weekend, Copetas shared a hotel suite with his friend Hunter S. Thompson. The way Patrick Anderson tells it in his book High in America, a conferencegoer sidled up to Thompson during a luncheon attended by roughly 300 people and passed the writer some cocaine. Copetas then held up a copy of the New York Times, which they used to shield themselves as they enjoyed the gift they’d just received.

“Oh, dear. The things we did in our youth, huh?” Copetas told me when I asked about that moment. “I will plead the Fifth Amendment on that. Although I will say I did hold up a New York Times.”

Later that same day, Dec. 10, 1977, Copetas and Thompson headed over to the big NORML Christmas party. The 600 attendees who had crammed themselves into a D.C. town house that evening were typical Washington creatures: political staffers, journalists, do-gooder nonprofit types. That night, they saw a rock band and strobe lights and a juggler and silver trays full of caviar and joints. They saw Keith Stroup, Mr. Marijuana, presiding over it all. Then they saw Peter Bourne, the White House drug czar, walk through the front door.

Bourne got a hero’s welcome—hugs and handshakes from marijuana lovers who appreciated everything he’d done for their cause. For Stroup, Bourne was his guy on the inside, and it was important to keep him happy. So he paid close attention when a friend passed along a message. Those words, in Stroup’s memory: “Peter says he wouldn’t mind doing a line of coke.”

“My first reaction was: ‘What? Did I hear—did I hear you right?’ ” Stroup said. His second reaction was to go looking for cocaine. The way Stroup tells it, he tracked down some coke, then asked Bourne to go upstairs to a private room.

“Everyone in the house could see who was going up that stair. It was like a stage,” Copetas told me. Stroup said, “It was kind of almost incriminating to be seen walking up there.”

Copetas declined to tell me exactly what happened next, “because that was a private interlude as far as I’m concerned and always will be.” But Stroup didn’t hold back. He said, “We sat around and all did a few lines of coke and then, OK, better get back down and say hello to some more people. And Peter said, ‘Yeah, I need to get going too.’ And we left.”

Copetas did say this, about the aftermath of that get-together: “After I went back to sit down, Hunter looked at me and said, ‘Jesus Christ, Craig, we’re all going to be indicted now.’ ”

But Stroup was more excited than paranoid. “Shit, snorting a line with the president’s drug czar?” he said. “This is not a bad thing in that it means that we have some secrets we’re now sharing. We have some intimate moments that we haven’t had before.”

Word spread quickly inside the town house: Peter Bourne, the drug czar, had done cocaine.

When I asked Bourne what he remembered about the party, he said “very little”—that it was “just sort of the usual crowd, the strong Carter supporters.”

He denied asking for cocaine that night. He told me that claim was “so untrue.”

“I may have been stupid enough to go to the party, but I had no interest in doing cocaine,” he said. “I would have gone somewhere else if I had wanted to do that. There may have been cocaine there at some point, but I was not a participant.”

I asked Bourne if he used cocaine at all, outside the party.

His answer: “I’ve never used cocaine. Have I? I don’t think so. Because I was very careful never to use marijuana or go anywhere where I would smoke marijuana. So, you know, being that cautious, I don’t know why in the world I would use cocaine.”

The NORML Christmas party ended around 4 a.m., with something like a dozen people passed out around the town house. The political staffers, the journalists, and the do-gooder nonprofit types all went back home, and back to work. For the next few months, life in Washington carried on as usual. And then, very suddenly, everything blew up.

The undoing of Peter Bourne began on a Friday afternoon in July 1978, when a young woman came to him and said she was having trouble sleeping. She asked Bourne if he could write her a prescription for sleeping pills.

That woman worked for Bourne at the White House. And he could prescribe her medication since he was a licensed doctor. So that day he wrote her a prescription for Quaaludes.

Quaaludes were extremely popular in the ’70s, as sleeping pills but also as an aphrodisiac. Bourne told the woman that he’d give her a pseudonym for the Quaalude prescription so it wouldn’t show up if she ever tried to get a security clearance. “It’s a regular practice if you have somebody who wants to keep their use of drugs confidential,” he told me.

The woman, Bourne’s aide, asked a friend to pick up her prescription. When that friend went to the drugstore, a pharmacy inspector happened to be there, doing routine rounds. The woman’s friend got arrested for “attempting to obtain a controlled substance by the use of a false name.” And when it came out that the drug czar’s name was on the prescription, the story was all over the national news.

Bourne thought it would eventually blow over. But the day after the Quaalude story came out, investigative reporter Jack Anderson went on ABC’s Good Morning America to deliver some new information: Three witnesses had seen the drug czar, Peter Bourne, snort cocaine at the NORML Christmas party.

Anderson’s report didn’t name any of the three witnesses, but it did say they had “provided complete and convincing details.”

“Like an idiot,” Stroup told me, “I somehow managed to take what was a confined scandal and find a way to put myself in the middle of it.”

Why did Stroup tell a reporter that Bourne had done coke? Bourne was the best ally he’d ever had. Together, they’d been spreading the gospel of decriminalization across the country.

But Stroup had become convinced that American marijuana smokers were in danger of being killed. And he thought the Carter administration, and Bourne, was complicit.

The issue was an herbicide called paraquat. The Mexican government was spraying paraquat on poppy and marijuana fields, using helicopters provided by the United States. And so, the theory went, anyone who smoked pot imported from Mexico might be inhaling paraquat. “I remember at the time there were articles saying that even a teaspoon of paraquat on your tongue and you’d have an agonizing death. It’s that strong,” Stroup said.

Stroup told Bourne that all this needed to stop—that marijuana smokers were in grave danger. But Bourne didn’t buy it.

“I thought it was all bullshit,” he said. “We paid thousands of dollars to have it analyzed. … I mean, the paraquat thing was totally scientifically wrong.”

There’s not much clear evidence that paraquat ever harmed American marijuana smokers. But the chemical is extremely toxic, and Stroup was disgusted that Bourne thought that was no big deal.

Stroup and Bourne had found common ground on decriminalization. But they were now on opposite sides of what Stroup considered an existential issue. Stroup had been able to look past that tension in 1977. But in the first few months of 1978, he began to view Bourne’s actions as unforgivable. “At that point, it was like, Jesus Christ, Peter, if you’re going to play life and death, don’t forget, I got something over here too.”

The something that Stroup had was his story about the NORML Christmas party. A bunch of reporters had seen Bourne at the party, and plenty of them had heard whispers about the drug czar doing coke. One of those journalists worked for Anderson. In the weeks after the party, that reporter pestered Stroup to confirm the cocaine rumors.

Stroup initially refused, but now he changed his mind. He was ready to talk. And he gave up the names of two other witnesses.

He said that all of this was off the record—for now. But five months later, after the Quaalude news broke, Stroup gave his blessing for the cocaine story to get aired, so long as his name was not attached. On July 21, 1978, on Good Morning America, the bomb Stroup planted finally went off.

When the news broke, Bourne told his colleagues at the White House that he’d seen cocaine at the party but that he hadn’t used it. That explanation was not enough to save the drug czar’s job. At a news conference, Jimmy Carter announced, “Dr. Peter Bourne, out of consideration for my administration, has submitted his resignation this afternoon, which I have accepted with regret.”

Bourne didn’t leave the White House quietly. After he resigned, he told the New York Times that marijuana use was commonplace at the White House. He also said that “a few” of his colleagues did cocaine. A couple of days later, Carter sent a memo to the White House staff. “I expect [everyone] to obey the law,” the president said. “You will obey it, or you will seek employment elsewhere.”

Stroup hadn’t been named in the Good Morning America story that took down Bourne. But he did give a quote to the Washington Post and basically outed himself as the original source.

After that, Stroup got out of town, going to Las Vegas to hang out with his friend Willie Nelson and clear his head. “By the time I got back to D.C., I realized two things,” he said. “That Peter had ended up being hurt more than he deserved, and … that my career with NORML almost certainly was coming to an end.”

Stroup had severed his connection to the White House, and he’d done it recklessly: “Any idiot should have recognized that even if I felt threatened about paraquat spraying or even if I was angry about something else, that didn’t justify destroying that point of access to power.”

The founder of NORML had also violated the drug user’s code: You don’t snort and tell. Stroup issued an apology, but too much damage had been done. In December 1978, at NORML’s annual conference, he delivered his farewell speech as the group’s executive director. A year earlier, that conference had been a nonstop celebration, and Stroup and Bourne had seemed indestructible. Now they’d both been disgraced, and their downfall had profound consequences for the pro-marijuana movement they’d been working to build.

Before the Bourne scandal, a relaxed approach to marijuana had fit in perfectly with the Carter administration’s priorities. Afterward, the White House pulled back from anything that might be perceived as soft on drugs. Bourne’s successor as drug czar declared that both he and the president “adamantly oppose the use of marijuana, period.”

For the parent activists from Atlanta, Bourne’s ouster was the opening they needed. In the early days of the Carter administration, Marsha Keith Schuchard had gotten iced out. Now she scored an invitation to the newly anti-marijuana White House, where she made her pitch about how weed was damaging kids.

In 1979 the National Institute on Drug Abuse published a booklet researched and written by Schuchard. It was called Parents, Peers, and Pot. It told the story of her daughter’s smoke-filled 13th birthday party, and everything that came after. The booklet was full of alarming claims, including that marijuana might cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys. Government scientists found Schuchard’s prose hyperbolic, but the public ate it up. “After a million copies were ordered, they stopped printing it because they said we have too many orders,” Schuchard said.

When Ronald and Nancy Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, the parent activists became even more influential. Schuchard said that when she told Nancy Reagan she was a liberal, the first lady responded that it was a nonpartisan movement and they were all in this together. “I had to give her credit for that,” Schuchard said.

Marijuana usage peaked in America in 1979, then fell in every age category in the 1980s. Decriminalization stopped cold. A few months before Bourne had resigned as the White House drug czar, Nebraska became the 11th state to decriminalize marijuana. No other states followed suit in the next two decades.

Peter Bourne is 86 now. When we spoke a few years ago, he was splitting his time between northern Virginia and a farm in Wales, where he and his wife were raising llamas. When I asked him if he’d been the most progressive drug czar of all time, he said, “Yes, by far.”

Seventeen years after Keith Stroup resigned, he got rehired as NORML’s executive director. He’s now the group’s legal counsel. In his early 80s, Stroup finally sees the world he’d always imagined beginning to take shape. In Virginia, where he lives, it’s legal for adults 21 and older to possess, consume, and grow small amounts of marijuana. At the end of our interview, he invited me to come over and light one up sometime.

Stroup has said that ratting out Peter Bourne was the “stupidest decision” he ever made. He said the most recent time they ran into each other was more than 10 years ago, at a cocktail party. While they did stop and chat for a minute, “neither of us tried to make a move to say, You want to get a beer sometime?” Stroup told me. “I think we both recognized that we had passed that point of no return a long time ago.”

When I asked Bourne how much he blamed Stroup for his downfall, he stopped to consider the question for a brief moment. Then he answered: “I suppose, quite a lot.”

Bourne told me that back in the 1970s, he hadn’t understood what Stroup was doing—why he’d been so outraged, paranoid, and hell-bent on destroying what had been a productive partnership. But now, he said, he thinks he gets what was going on. “I don’t think I’m betraying confidences, but what I was unaware of then was that he had a serious cocaine problem,” he said. “I can see that he wasn’t wielding good judgment.”

“I don’t doubt that cocaine had something to do with it, sure,” Stroup told me. “You get very ragged when you’re doing cocaine. You get irritable, sometimes you get angry [about] things that wouldn’t make you angry otherwise. The cocaine use was not helpful. I don’t think I can use it as an excuse, but it probably did cause my responses to be exaggerated at times.”

Stroup and Bourne will never agree about what happened in that private room at the NORML Christmas party. But here, there’s something approaching consensus: Mr. Marijuana dropped a dime on the drug czar for doing cocaine because he himself was doing too much cocaine. And that is how the pro-pot movement of the 1970s went up in smoke.

            <h2>North American air defense troops ready for 70th year of Santa tracking</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Seventy years ago, a child phoned the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) looking for Santa Claus – and found him, or at least some kindly military personnel who were willing to play along by helping the youngster to track Santa&#39;s location as he zipped around the globe.

NORAD, then known as the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), took calls from children near its Colorado Springs headquarters by mistake.

According to NORAD commander General Gregory Guillot, the 70-year-old tradition of NORAD tracking Santa Claus&#39; journey around the world on Christmas Eve began in 1955 with a newspaper misprint.

As the story goes, a Sears Roebuck ad included a phone number for children to call, but that number was wrong. Instead of reaching the retailer’s Christmas line, it included the unlisted number for NORAD command.

When the first child called, Colonel Harry Shoup reportedly decided to roll with the unexpected Christmas Eve surprise and told staff to check NORAD radar systems for Santa&#39;s location. He offered the same response to other young callers throughout the night.

Now in its 70th year, NORAD has upheld the tradition yearly ever since, describing itself on its Santa Tracker website as &quot;the only organization that has the technology, the qualifications, and the people to do it.&quot;

When NORAD isn&#39;t tracking Santa, it handles aerospace warning and control for defense of the US and Canada, including warnings about unknown objects – like flying sleighs – plus potentially threatening missiles and aircraft.

&quot;NORAD has successfully tracked Santa since 1955 using three tools we use every day in defense of North America,&quot; an agency spokesperson told The Register. &quot;A network of ground-based radars called the North Warning System, infrared sensors on satellites more than 22,000 miles above the Earth, and, of course, our NORAD fighter jets comprised of U.S. F-16s, F-15s, F-22s and F-35s, and Canadian CF-18s.&quot;

NORAD told us that it doesn&#39;t have any advance knowledge of Santa&#39;s planned route, as he doesn&#39;t share that information with the US government, but they do know that he tends to follow a typical Christmas Eve agenda.

&quot;He typically takes off from the North Pole at around 4:00 AM Mountain Time (6:00 AM Eastern Time) and heads west across the international dateline,&quot; NORAD explained - Santa has to start where it&#39;s later on Christmas Eve, after all. &quot;He then zig-zags north and south as he delivers presents around the world.&quot;

NORAD explains that Santa typically arrives at homes to drop off gifts between 9:00 PM and midnight, local time, which is why General Guillot recommends children be in bed by 8:00 PM on Christmas Eve to avoid Santa skipping their home and having to backtrack later on. He does do that, according to NORAD&#39;s tracking data.

Given Santa may have OPSEC reasons for not wanting to be tracked so thoroughly, we asked the experts at NORAD why he doesn&#39;t upgrade his sleigh to make it harder to detect, which they said they can&#39;t explain.

&quot;Even with the highest security clearances of some personnel here at NORAD, we aren&#39;t privy to upgrades Santa may be making to his sleigh for his magical journey,&quot; a NORAD spokesperson told us - all they know is that they continue to be able to track him every year.

Santa moves fast, and while it may have been easy for NORAD staff to track him on their own and respond to calls from kids back when the tradition was new, the Santa tracking operation received over 380,000 calls last year. With Santa tracking now an international tradition, it&#39;s become a pretty big deal that needs more people than the US and Canadian militaries can drum up.

&quot;More than 1,000 volunteers – military and civilian members of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, plus family and local community members – begin answering phone calls from around the world at 4:00 AM, when Santa leaves the North Pole,&quot; NORAD told us.

For those interested in volunteering, sorry, but you need to be a Peterson Space Force Base local in order to participate: NORAD doesn&#39;t farm out the work to remote volunteers.

Those who want to reach out to NORAD to learn where Santa is can call the volunteers at +1-877-446-6723 from 4:00 AM Mountain Time until midnight on Christmas Eve, and can also call directly from the Santa Tracker website, which will also host a visual Santa tracker once he lifts off on Wednesday morning for NORAD&#39;s 70th year of tracking the progress of the jolly man in red as he hauls Christmas gifts around the world. ®

            <h2>NASA tries Curiosity rover's Mastcam to work out where MAVEN might be</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/nasa_tries_trundlebot_mastcam_to/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA&#39;s MAVEN spacecraft is continuing to evade attempts by engineers to make contact as the solar conjunction nears, halting contact with any Mars missions until January 16, 2026.

The agency last heard from the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) orbiter on December 6, and the last fragment of tracking data recovered by engineers indicated that the probe was tumbling and that its orbit trajectory might have changed.

The latter point is highly significant – if any engineers can&#39;t work out where the spacecraft is, contacting it is highly challenging, either from Earth or using one of the other Mars orbiters or rovers. According to NASA, on December 16 and 20, the Curiosity trundlebot team used the rover&#39;s Mastcam instrument in an attempt to image MAVEN&#39;s reference orbit, but the spacecraft was not detected.

The problem now is that the solar conjunction is approaching. The Mars solar conjunction occurs when Mars and Earth are on opposite sides of the Sun. This means that from Monday, December 29, until Friday, January 16, NASA will not have contact with any Mars missions and won&#39;t be able to fire commands at MAVEN in the hope of getting a response from the stricken spacecraft.

Once the solar conjunction window is over, NASA will resume attempts to reestablish communications with the orbiter.

What happened to the orbiter remains unclear. A spacecraft upset usually triggers safe mode, in which the probe detects an issue, shuts down all non-essential systems, and awaits instructions. NASA, however, has not confirmed that the probe has entered this mode. A space industry insider told The Register &quot;If it were [in safe mode] they [NASA] would be more successful in communicating with it.

&quot;So whatever has happened, it hasn&#39;t been able to reach safe mode.&quot;

There are plenty of reasons why this might be. The unexpected rotation of the probe indicates that some energetic event happened. If the orbit has indeed changed, then the problem could lie somewhere in the Guidance, Navigation, and Control systems of the spacecraft. Perhaps some unbalanced thrust or an issue with the spacecraft&#39;s attitude measurements.

In 2022, MAVEN had a brush with mission termination after problems with its Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), used for navigation, which led to a lengthy stint in safe mode. In that instance, the spacecraft switched to a backup system while controllers worked to resolve the issue.

MAVEN is well into its extended mission and, while it has not endured as long in orbit as either NASA&#39;s Mars Odyssey probe or the European Space Agency&#39;s Mars Express, it has been circling the red planet since September 2014.

The probe&#39;s orbit will, in the absence of thruster firings, eventually deteriorate, and the spacecraft will burn up in Mars&#39; atmosphere. Some components are expected to survive all the way to the surface. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Part 1 You can switch to running mostly FOSS without switching to Linux. First, though, give your OS a bit of TLC. We&#39;ll come back to what to do next in part two.

Most computers run the OS they came installed with until they&#39;re scrapped… because most non-specialists would prefer to just buy a whole new computer than deal with trying to change their OS. The majority of desktop and laptop computer users have never seen or used anything but Windows, and of the remainder, most use Macs – and the same applies. Most Macs will never run anything but their original copy of macOS.

If you&#39;re happy with that, it&#39;s OK. Switching OS is a big ask, especially if you&#39;re happy with Windows or macOS. You can still benefit from the world of FOSS – for instance, if you&#39;re tired of paying for applications, or worse still, app subscriptions, you have plenty of options. This is especially true if you&#39;re using an older version of your OS and the vendor isn&#39;t sending you updates any more.

If you can, think about wiping and reinstalling. This applies equally to PCs and Macs.

Firstly, if you&#39;ve got a really old OS and you&#39;re willing and able to reinstall it, that is a good move. A clean installation will be faster.

Before you start, back up all your stuff. Ideally, make at least two complete backups of all your files, and this includes the data files of apps that store and manage data, such as email clients. Buy some USB keys, a couple of small ones and a couple of the biggest ones you can afford. Using the OS&#39;s built-in tools, do a full backup of the whole computer onto one of the big keys. As well as this backup, on the second big key, manually copy all your files. Look for where things like email clients store their data – Google is still helpful for stuff like this – and include those too. If there&#39;s room, duplicate the whole lot: the more copies the better. Even if you decide not to go ahead, having this kept somewhere safe is a great safety net.

Also, max out your old box. We recommend fitting as much memory as your machine will take – secondhand RAM is fine, it doesn&#39;t wear out, and your local small computer store should help. If the machine has a spinning hard disk drive, get an SSD, and put the old disk into an external USB caddy as a backup drive.

Here, Mac users have it easy: Apple has an official &quot;How to download and install macOS&quot; page, with links to all versions from 10.13 to the current Tahoe. And of course there are no keys, serial numbers, activation or anything.

We recommend running the latest OS version that your Mac can handle. Even High Sierra is still usable. As we wrote when the latest Firefox ESR appeared in June, the ESR release before last, Firefox 115, is still getting security updates on macOS 10.13. We&#39;ve also previously covered alternative browsers for macOS versions even older than High Sierra — all is not lost.

There&#39;s a built-in command to create a bootable USB installer inside the macOS installer application, but if that sounds too intimidating, there are third-party point-and-click apps such as MacDaddy&#39;s Install Disk Creator or the open source TINU.

If the latest OS your Mac can run is just a bit too old to be practical, then OCLP can help. OpenCore Legacy Patcher, to give it its full name, will let you install a newer macOS than Apple officially supports. For now, it tops out at Sequoia, macOS 15. The team is working on Tahoe support, but don&#39;t even try it for now. If you have a well-specced older Mac that&#39;s still adequate for your needs, it&#39;s worth a shot, but have multiple backups and be prepared to just reinstall the latest supported version, restore your backup, and get on with life.

On PC, life is a bit more complicated, as ever.

Firstly, and we expect some will disagree here, we suggest that you avoid the vendor&#39;s own reinstallation disks. A lot of PC vendors benefit from additional income derived from bundling bloatware with their new machines. If you use the vendor&#39;s own reinstallation media, you reinstall that bloat too. Secondly, the result will probably be very dated and so need tons of updates, which will take hours.

Before you begin, you should grab a copy of Snappy Driver Installer Origin and put it on a clean, empty USB key. Then run it, directly on the new key, and tell it to download all its driver packs. SDIO is the only driver-installer tool we trust and recommend. Don&#39;t pay for any alternative: indeed, we suggest you avoid anything else. SDIO is big – it takes quite a few gigabytes with all the driver packs or more – and takes a long time to download all the drivers, but it does the job. We&#39;ve found it helpful from Windows XP all the way up to Windows 10.

Next, get a clean version of Windows. If you have the license key, you&#39;re all set. If you don&#39;t have your license key, then you can extract it from the running copy of Windows with Nirsoft ProduKey.

Using the key for older versions, you can download a clean copy from Microsoft itself. It has download pages for Windows 10 ISO files and Windows 11 ones too.

However, if you are willing to change versions, we suggest switching to Windows 10 LTSC. As we explained back in August, the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 edition will get updates until 2027, and if you don&#39;t mind using US English, it&#39;ll last until 2032. As an added bonus, it&#39;s remarkably uncluttered – it doesn&#39;t even have the Windows Store, and so no &quot;Modern&quot; applications. Aside from Notepad, there&#39;s very little there at all, which is just how we like it.

As we have written before, if you just want to write a Windows ISO to a USB key, then Rufus can help, but Ventoy is quicker and more flexible.

Some of the hints for older, unsupported OSes apply equally to both Mac and Windows. Both come with an assortment of bundled apps and tools – accessories is a handy catch-all term – and once the OS isn&#39;t getting updated, then the accessories aren&#39;t either.

That may not matter. For example, there&#39;s very little risk in using an outdated text editor, although the vendors are working hard to make it more risky by embedding pointless bloat such as LLM-bot based &quot;AI assistants.&quot; The thing to consider is an extension of such a universal rule that it&#39;s got a name – Zawinski&#39;s Law:

Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.

The thing to consider here is whether the handy accessory talks to the internet. If it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s fairly safe. If it does, then it&#39;s a potential risk, and think about replacing it – ideally with some FOSS tool that&#39;s still maintained. Chat or messaging clients, email programs, streaming music players – these have to talk to the internet to work, and so bundled and built-in ones are a risk. To keep using an older OS, look for replacements for any accessory that talks to the internet, and replace it. We will return to this in the second part of this short series.

Of course it doesn&#39;t need to be a clean, empty copy of Windows. It will work even on a well-used installation, and once you&#39;re content with your replacement apps, you can uninstall anything you no longer need. We&#39;ve given some tips on doing some housekeeping on Windows, both before dual-booting and then again when discussing running Windows 7 nowadays.

In brief: run Windows Update. Update everything. Reboot, and do it again, and keep doing that until there are no more updates. Then run Disk Cleanup, tick all the boxes, let it work, then do the same again but tick the &quot;Clean up system files&quot; button first. Reboot, and do it again. Finally, right-click the Start button and click the entry for Command Prompt (Admin) or words to that effect, type CHKDSK C: /F, answer &quot;Y&quot; for &quot;Yes&quot; and then reboot, to fix any disk corruption.

If you&#39;ve already upgraded to Windows 11 and regret it, you may be able to downgrade again – even if the built-in uninstaller isn&#39;t available. We haven&#39;t tried this yet, but TeknixStuff&#39;s UpDownTool claims to be able to reinstall Windows 10 LTSC on top of Windows 11.

If you don&#39;t want to switch to LTSC, there are some tools to help cut the crud from ordinary retail Windows a bit. In the past, we have used O&O AppBuster and O&O ShutUp with considerable success.

What we recommend avoiding, though, are third-party cleanup tools, especially &quot;registry cleaners.&quot; These can do more harm than good.

Once you&#39;ve either got a clean install of your unfashionable but pragmatic OS, then the next question is what you install and run on it. We explore that in part two. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft wants to translate its codebase to Rust, and is hiring people to make it happen.

“My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030,” Microsoft distinguished engineer Galen Hunt wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.

“Our strategy is to combine AI and Algorithms to rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases,” he added. “Our North Star is ‘1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code.’”

Hunt’s post mentions a job ad for a Principal Software Engineer who will be expected to work on the tools Microsoft is building to pull this off.

“The purpose of this … role is to help us evolve and augment our infrastructure to enable translating Microsoft’s largest C and C++ systems to Rust,” Hunt wrote.

Microsoft has already built some tools to make the move.

“We’ve built a powerful code processing infrastructure,” Hunt wrote. “Our algorithmic infrastructure creates a scalable graph over source code at scale. Our AI processing infrastructure then enables us to apply AI agents, guided by algorithms, to make code modifications at scale.”

Whoever gets the job will work within Microsoft’s Future of Scalable Software Engineering group, a team Hunt says has a mission to “build capabilities to allow Microsoft and our customers to eliminate technical debt at scale.”

“We pioneer new tools and techniques with internal customers and partners, and then work with other product groups to deploy those capabilities at scale across Microsoft and across the industry,” he wrote.

Unlike C and C++, Rust is a memory-safe language, meaning it uses automated memory management to avoid out-of-bounds reads and writes, and use-after-free errors, as both offer attackers a chance to control devices. In recent years, governments have called for universal adoption of memory-safe languages – and especially Rust – to improve software security.

Microsoft has also called for greater use of Rust. In 2022, the CTO of the company’s Azure cloud called Rust to become the default language for new projects. Microsoft scientists have worked on a tool that automatically converts some C code to Rust.

The software behemoth has also created tools to help developers write Windows drivers using Rust.

Microsoft offers a vast array of products. The site MSportals.io lists over 500 active online portals for managing Microsoft products! The company also has a huge internal IT estate.

The effort required to re-write all that must surely be beyond enormous. It will doubtless surface huge numbers of edge cases that automation can’t address.

If you’re brave enough to want to make a contribution, the job Hunt mentions requires you to work three days a week in Microsoft’s Redmond office and pays between $139,900 and $274,800 a year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services has given Nutanix a lovely Christmas present: Support for its AHV hypervisor in hybrid cloud storage rigs.

AWS is keen on anything that drives demand for its services, and one of the tools it uses to get users interested in its cloudy storage offerings is the Storage Gateway, a tool that connects hypervisors to its Simple Storage Service (S3).

The cloud giant previously made Storage Gateway available as a workload for VMware’s ESXi, Microsoft’s Hyper-V, and Linux KVM.

On Monday, AWS announced support for AHV, too.

As AWS noted in its announcement, AHV is KVM-based, suggesting it wasn’t a stretch to add support for Nutanix.

Amazon’s enthusiasm for AHV emerged just 12 days after Nutanix delivered the integration with Pure Storage that it announced in May 2025. The company’s tie-up with Pure followed a similar deal with Dell. Both reflect Nutanix’s admission that while its native software-defined storage is an excellent offering, the majority of its current and potential customers aren’t going to stop using external arrays any time soon.

Nutanix is often the first name on any list of VMware alternatives written by organizations who feel that Broadcom’s acquisition of the virtualization giant means they need to consider the market for server virtualization and private cloud tools. Broadcom created such sentiments by focusing its sales efforts on Cloud Foundation, an integrated suite that powers private clouds, and making it hard for customers to buy its less capable products.

Broadcom argues that its customers will be better off adopting Cloud Foundation, and counters criticism that the bundle is expensive by arguing those who adopt it fully will enjoy swift and substantial ROI. Analyst firm Gartner, however, believes Broadcom’s actions will see VMware lose 35 percent of the workloads it currently manages within three years.

Nutanix execs have told The Register that its discussions with VMware users have shifted from inquisitive exploration to implementation contemplation.

With Nutanix on the cusp of potential growth, and already open to expanding its storage options, it’s unsurprising AWS wants to make sure it’s in a position to get its share of the action. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">World War Fee The United States will impose tariffs on semiconductors imported from China, starting in 2027.

News of the plan emerged in a Notice of Action [PDF] signed by Jennifer Thornton, General Counsel at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which posted the document on Monday.

The Notice is the result of an investigation into China’s semiconductor industry that the Biden administration commenced in December 2024, and which focused on “foundational semiconductors (also known as legacy or mature node semiconductors), including to the extent that they are incorporated as components into downstream products for critical industries like defense, automotive, medical devices, aerospace, telecommunications, and power generation and the electrical grid.”

The investigation found,“For decades, China has targeted the semiconductor industry for dominance and has employed increasingly aggressive and sweeping non-market policies and practices in pursuing dominance of the sector.” Those practices, the document concludes, “severely disadvantaged U.S. companies, workers, and the U.S. economy generally.”

The Notice therefore concludes that tariffs on Chinese chips are appropriate, but not urgent because the document sets them at zero percent until mid-2027.

The US will increase tariffs on June 23rd, 2027, and will decide the rate of that impost no fewer than 30 days before the aforementioned date.

Also on Monday, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer penned an opinion piece arguing that tariffs are a tool that brings trading partners to the negotiating table to discuss investments that help the Trump administration pursue its goal of re-industrializing America.

The administration has therefore given Chinese chipmakers time to contemplate whether they want to open for business in the USA.

Similar negotiating tactics and incentives offered under the CHIPS Act have already seen foreign chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung make massive investments in manufacturing on US soil, and Intel resolve to build factories at home instead of offshore.

In remarks made in January and August, President Trump suggested imported semiconductors could attract tariffs of “25, 50 or even 100 percent.”

Levies at that level are nowhere to be found in this week’s announcements. ®

            <div id="article-text">Gen-AI showed up in the year’s biggest releases including game of the year.

Gen-AI showed up in the year’s biggest releases including game of the year.

2025 was the year generative AI made its presence felt in the video game industry. Its use has been discovered in some of the most popular games of the year, and CEOs from some of the largest game studios claim it’s being implemented everywhere in the industry including in their own development processes. Meanwhile, rank-and-file developers, especially in the indie games space, are pushing back against its encroachment, coming up with ways to signal their games are gen-AI free.

Generative AI has largely replaced NFTs as the buzzy trend publishers are chasing. Its proponents claim that the technology will be a great democratization force in video game development, as gen AI’s ability to amalgamate images, text, audio, and video could shorten development times and shrink budgets — ameliorating two major problems plaguing the industry right now. In service to that idea, numerous video game studios have announced partnerships with gen-AI companies.

Ubisoft has technology that can generate short snippets of dialogue called barks and has gen-AI powered NPCs that players can have conversations with. EA has partnered with Stability AI, Microsoft is using AI to analyze and generate gameplay. Outside of official partnerships, major game companies like Nexon, Krafton, and Square Enix are vocally embracing gen AI.

As a result, gen AI is starting to show up in games in a big way. Up until this point, gen AI in gaming had been mostly relegated to fringe cases — either prototypes or small, low-quality games that generally get lost in the tens of thousands of titles released on Steam each year. But now, gen AI is cropping up in the year’s biggest releases. ARC Raiders, one of the breakout multiplayer shooter hits of the year, used gen AI for character dialogue. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 used gen-AI images. Even 2025’s TGA Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, featured gen-AI images before they were quietly removed.

Reaction to this encroachment from both players and developers has been mixed. It seems like generally, players don’t like gen AI showing up in games. When gen-AI assets were discovered in Anno 117: Pax Romana, the game’s developer Ubisoft claimed the assets “slipped through” review and they were subsequently replaced. When gen-AI assets were found in Black Ops 7, however, Activision acknowledged the issue, but kept the images in the game. Critical response has also been lopsided. ARC Raiders was awarded low scores with reviewers specifically citing the use of gen AI as the reason. Clair Obscur, though, was nigh universally praised and its use of gen AI, however temporary, has barely been mentioned.

It seems like developers are sensitive to the public’s distaste for gen AI but are unwilling to commit to not using it. After gen-AI assets were discovered in Black Ops 7, Activision said it uses the tech to “empower” its developers, not replace them. When asked about gen AI showing up in Battlefield 6, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz called the technology seductive but affirmed it wouldn’t appear in the final product. Swen Vincke, CEO of Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, said gen AI is being used for the studio’s next game Divinity but only for generating concepts and ideas. Everything in the finished game, he claimed, would be made by humans. He also hinted at why game makers insist on using the tech despite the backlash developers usually receive whenever it’s found.

“This is a tech-driven industry, so you try stuff,” he told Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier in an interview. “You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead.”

Comments from other CEOs reinforce Vincke’s point. Junghun Lee, the CEO of ARC Raiders’ parent company Nexon, said in an interview that, “It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.”

The problem is, though, gen AI doesn’t yet seem to be the golden egg its supporters want people to believe it is. Last year, Keywords Studios, a game development services company, published a report on creating a 2D video game using only gen-AI tools. The company claimed that gen-AI tools can streamline some development processes but ultimately cannot replace the work of human talent. Discovering gen AI in Call of Duty and Pax Romana was possible precisely because of the low-quality of the images that were found. With Ubisoft’s interactive gen-AI NPCs, the dialogue they spout sounds unnatural and stilted. Players in the 2025 Chinese martial arts MMORPG Where Winds Meet are manipulating its AI chatbot NPCs to break the game, just like Fortnite players were able to make AI-powered Darth Vader swear.

For all the promises of gen AI, its current results do not live up to expectations. So why is it everywhere?

One reason is the competitive edge AI might but currently can’t provide that Swen Vincke alluded to in his interview with Bloomberg. Another reason is also the simplest: it’s the economy, stupid. Despite inflation, flagging consumer confidence and spending, and rising unemployment, the stock market is still booming, propped up by the billions and billions of dollars being poured into AI tech. Game makers in search of capital to keep business and profits going want in on that. Announcing AI initiatives and touting the use of AI tools — even if those tools have a relatively minor impact on the final product — can be a way to signal to AI-eager investors that a game company is worth their money.

That might explain why the majority of gen-AI’s supporters in gaming come from the C-suite of AAA studios and not smaller indie outfits who almost universally revile the tech. Indies face the same economic pressure as bigger studios but have far fewer resources to navigate those pressures. Ostensibly, indie developers are the ones who stand to benefit the most from the tech but, so far, are its biggest opponents. They are pushing back against the assertion that gen AI is everywhere, being used by everybody, with some marking their games with anti-AI logos proclaiming their games were made wholly by humans.

For some indie developers, using gen AI defeats the purpose of game making entirely. The challenge of coming up with ideas and solutions to development problems — the things gen AI is supposed to automate — is a big part of game making’s appeal to them. There are also moral and environmental implications indie developers seem especially sensitive to. Gen-AI outputs are cobbled from existing bodies of work that were often used without consent or compensation. AI data centers are notorious for consumptive energy usage and polluting their surrounding areas, which are increasingly focused in low-income and minority communities.With its unrealized promises and so-far shoddy outputs, it’s easy to think of gen AI as gaming’s next flash in the pan the way NFTs were. But with gaming’s biggest companies increasingly reporting their use, gen AI will remain a lightning rod in game development — until the tech improves, or, like with NFTs, the bubble pops.

            <div id="article-text">Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

It’s a good thing that we already know a second season of Pluribus is on the way. Because the season finale for the show — a sci-fi drama on Apple TV, helmed by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — made it clear that things are just getting started. The episode brought together a number of significant threads but, more importantly, opened up potentially explosive (literally) new lines of inquiry for what comes next.

Spoiler to follow for the first season of Pluribus.

First, a little reminder of how we got here. The inciting incident of Pluribus was the release of a virus of unknown, but extraterrestrial, origins, that turned almost the entirety of the Earth’s human population into an interconnected hive mind. The hive are peaceful, to the point that they won’t even kill a bug or pick an apple off of a tree, and they are physically harmed by negative emotions. There are around a dozen people who weren’t impacted by the virus. Most notably this includes an American woman named Carol (Rhea Seehorn) and a Paraguayan man named Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga). For most of the season, the pair have been separated physically, but united in being vehemently opposed to the hive’s presence, while trying to figure out a way to “save” the world by making it the way it used to be.

The finale sees these two finally able to meet up with each other — but things have changed for Carol. In the penultimate episode, her feelings toward the hive began to soften, primarily as she grew closer to her chaperone Zosia (Karolina Wydra). In fact, by the time the finale starts, they’re a full-on couple. It’s a far cry from the early days of the show, when Carol was so antagonistic to the hive that they abandoned her and the city of Albuquerque for safety reasons.

But Carol’s new view of the hive, and Zosia in particular, means that things don’t go quite the way Manousos expected. Instead of finding a like-minded comrade who would help him “save the world,” he finds a version of Carol that is reluctant to even speak to him. The dynamic is much like Pluribus’ second episode, in which Carol fails to convince the rest of the survivors that they should work toward putting the world back the way it was. Only this time the roles are reversed. Combine this dynamic with the fact that Carol and Manousos are both extremely stubborn people who are using Google Translate to communicate and, well, it’s not exactly a smooth meeting. After the first time the two talk, Manousos mutters to himself “well this is going just great.”

By the end of the episode, though, the two seem largely on the same page. And that’s because Carol learns that, despite her budding romance with Zosia, the hive are still diligently working on bringing her into the fold (the episode actually opens by showing one of the other survivors joining the hive via a new procedure). This all culminates with Carol receiving a large package that turns out to be an atom bomb. I guess she wasn’t joking earlier in the season.

The first season of Pluribus has been a learning experience. While there are plenty of postapocalyptic shows, there’s really nothing quite like this strange, hive-mind-infected version of Earth. And so over nine episodes we see Carol emotionally coming to grips with her new reality, but also using that time to learn as much as she can about how the hive operates. This, in turn, helps us, the audience, understand just what the heck is going on. All stories require some kind of scene-setting, but Pluribus’ unique nature requires that much more.

But the reveal of the atom bomb at the end suggests that things are going in a different direction in season 2. I don’t expect Pluribus to suddenly become a fast-paced show; its measured pace is part of its appeal and allows it to really dig into the nitty-gritty details of the world. But many of the remaining plotlines and questions require more action than simply learning more about the hive. Manousos may have figured out a way to pull individuals out of the hive using radio signals; the hive are in the midst of building a “giant antenna” to possibly communicate with whoever or whatever sent the virus in the first place; the rest of the survivors have to decide whether or not they want to join; the hive need to sort out a solution to their impending food crisis; and, oh, there’s that bomb that Carol may or may not have a plan for.

I don’t know how many seasons the Pluribus story can reasonably stretch for, but it’s clear it needed at least two, just because there’s so much to set up. It’s not all that different from Apple TV’s other delightfully weird sci-fi series, Severance, a show that had a similarly unique premise and really pulled everything together by the end of its second season. Now we’ll have to wait and see if Pluribus can do the same.

﻿The five sanctioned individuals included Thierry Breton and Imran Ahmed, who feuded with Elon Musk.

On Tuesday, the Trump Administration followed through on a threat of retaliation targeting foreigners who are involved in content moderation. The State Department announced sanctions barring US access for former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, as well as four researchers, while issuing an intentionally chilling threat to others, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio claiming, “The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course.”

One of the researchers the State Department says is banned and now deportable, is Imran Ahmed, who runs the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), an organization aimed at identifying and pushing back against hate speech online that Elon Musk tried and failed to censor with a lawsuit that was dismissed in early 2024. In his decision, Judge Charles Breyer wrote that X’s motivation for suing was to “punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp. — and perhaps in order to dissuade others.”

Breton is called “a mastermind of the Digital Services Act” by US Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers, who specifically referenced a letter he sent to Elon Musk ahead of a livestreamed event with Donald Trump that noted X’s legal obligations under the DSA relating to illegal content and disinformation.

The other researchers include Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, leaders of HateAid, a nonprofit that tried to sue X in 2023 for “failing to remove criminal antisemitic content,” as well as Clare Melford, leader of the Global Disinformation Index, which works on “fixing the systems that enable disinformation.”

The press release announcing the sanctions is titled “Announcement of Actions to Combat the Global Censorship-Industrial Complex,” the claimed target of Republicans like House Judiciary Committee leader Jim Jordan, as they’ve worked against attempts to apply fact-checking and misinformation research to social networks. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the State Department ordered US consulates to consider rejecting H-1B visa applicants involved in content moderation, and a few days ago, the Office of the US Trade Representative threatened retaliation against European tech giants like Spotify and SAP over supposedly “discriminatory” activity in regulating US tech platforms.

            <div id="article-text">Following Europe and Japan, Apple is opening things up for iOS users in Brazil.

Following Europe and Japan, Apple is opening things up for iOS users in Brazil.

Apple is set to allow third-party app stores on iOS in Brazil next year after settling with the country’s competition watchdog in a legal battle dating back to 2022, as reported by 9to5Mac.

According to a machine translation of a press release from the Brazilian regulator CADE, it has approved a Term of Commitment to Termination (TCC) made by Apple that obligates the company to allow third-party app stores and let developers use external payment systems. Warnings about third-party app stores and external payment systems must also have neutral wording.

Apple will be able to still charge fees, and the Brazilian publication Tecnoblog says in a machine translation that, according to CADE, those fees are:

Commission of 25% (general) or 10% (special programs)

App purchases on the App Store, but directed outside the store:

No fee if the routing involves static text (no clickable link/button)

15% fee if the owner of the app puts a button/link and directs to payment on his own website (outside the app environment)

Apple has argued against opening up iOS on the grounds that it could compromise the platform’s security. But regulation in other countries has already forced the company to let users in Europe and Japan install third-party app stores, and in the US, Apple allows for external payment links.

Apple has 105 days to put the changes into place, and if it doesn’t comply with its obligations, it could be subject to a fine of up to R$150 million (about $27 million).

The company shared the following statement with 9to5Mac about the decision:

In order to comply with regulatory demands from CADE, Apple is making changes that will impact iOS apps in Brazil. While these changes will open new privacy and security risks to users, we have worked to maintain protections against some threats, including keeping in place important safeguards for younger users. These safeguards will not eliminate every risk, but they will help ensure that iOS remains the best, most secure mobile platform available in Brazil and we will continue to advocate on behalf of users and developers.

Update, December 23rd: Added fee structure reported by Tecnoblog.

If you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone — or on the hunt for a solid last-minute gift — Google’s Pixel 10 is a great place to look. We consider it the best Android phone you can buy, and right now, you can grab it at Amazon starting at $449 ($350 off) when you use promo code PIXEL10, which drops Google’s entry-level flagship to its lowest price to date. If you prefer a better cameras or a bigger screen, Amazon is also offering the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL for $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, using the same code.

In her review, Verge senior reviewer Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone that offers some notable upgrades over its predecessor. It features a 6.3-inch OLED screen and a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, making it easy to see in direct sunlight. It also includes an array of helpful AI-powered tools and a dedicated telephoto camera — a first for a non-Pro Pixel phone — which is great for capturing portrait photos.

One of the Pixel 10’s more notable upgrades, though, is the addition of Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets — arguably the coolest part of the device — which means you don’t need a separate case for easy and precise charging alignment. The device also includes Google’s Tensor G5 chip, which is the same one found in the pricier Pro models; however, the Pixel 10 has slightly lower RAM (12GB versus 16GB). Still, you shouldn’t notice any major differences in everyday performance, unless you’re really pushing it with heavy multitasking and serious mobile gaming.

Our main gripe with the Pixel 10 is that its main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as those on the Pro. That said, the standard Pixel produces pictures that are perfectly fine, while the telephoto camera makes for a nice addition. At its normal $799 price, we think the Pixel 10 is already a great value. At $449, it’s a dang good deal.

He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <h2>How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130396/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-ai-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools; a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <h2>Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO₂—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO₂ out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO₂ is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO₂ release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO₂ is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO₂ this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan president William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” a reference to the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
