            <div id="article-text">On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.

That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.

Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.

We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was the image that launched a cultural icon. In 1967, in the Northern California woods, a 7-foot-tall, ape-like creature covered in black fur and walking upright was captured on camera, at one point turning around to look straight down the lens. The image is endlessly copied in popular culture—it’s even become an emoji. But what was it? A hoax? A bear? Or a real-life example of a mysterious species called the Bigfoot?

The film has been analysed and re-analysed countless times. Although most people believe it was some sort of hoax, there are some who argue that it’s never been definitively debunked. One group of people, dubbed Bigfooters, is so intrigued that they have taken to the forests of Washington, California, Oregon, Ohio, Florida, and beyond to look for evidence of the mythical creature.

But why? That’s what sociologists Jamie Lewis and Andrew Bartlett wanted to uncover. They were itching to understand what prompts this community to spend valuable time and resources looking for a beast that is highly unlikely to even exist. During lockdown, Lewis started interviewing more than 130 Bigfooters (and a few academics) about their views, experiences, and practices, culminating in the duo’s recent book “Bigfooters and Scientific Inquiry: On the Borderlands of Legitimate Science.”

Here, we talk to them about their academic investigation.

Lewis: It started when I was watching either the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and a show called Finding Bigfoot was advertised. I was really keen to know why this program was being scheduled on what certainly at the time was a nominally serious and sober natural history channel. The initial plan was to do an analysis of these television programmes, but we felt that wasn’t enough. It was lockdown and my wife was pregnant and in bed a lot with sickness, so I needed to fill my time.

Bartlett: One of the things that I worked on when Jamie and I shared an office in Cardiff was a sociological study of fringe physicists. These are people mostly outside of academic institutions trying to do science. I was interviewing these people, going to their conferences. And that led relatively smoothly into Bigfoot, but it was Jamie’s interest in Bigfoot that brought me to this field.

Lewis: It’s very hard to put a number on it. There is certainly a divide between what are known as “apers,” who believe that Bigfoot is just a primate unknown to science, and those that are perhaps more derogatorily called “woo-woos,” who believe that Bigfoot is some sort of interdimensional traveller, an alien of sort. We’re talking in the thousands of people. But there are a couple of hundred really serious people of which I probably interviewed at least half.

Many people back them. A YouGov survey conducted as recently as November 2025, suggested that as many as one quarter of Americans believe that Bigfoot either definitely or probably exists.

Lewis: I think there was definitely a worry that they would be caricatured. And I was often asked, “Do I believe in Bigfoot?” I had a standard answer that Andy and I agreed on, which was that mainstream, institutional science says there is absolutely no compelling evidence that Bigfoot exists. We have no reason to dissent with that consensus. But as sociologists what does exist is a community (or communities) of Bigfooting, and that’s what interests us.

Bartlett: One of the things that at least a couple of people reacted to once the book was published was the way we phrased that. On the blurb on the back of the book we say something along the lines of “Bigfoot exists if not as a physical biological creature then certainly as an object around which hundreds of people organise their lives.” A couple of people took that to be some kind of slight against them. It wasn’t.

Lewis: The community is very white, male, rural, and blue collar—often ex-military. I think Bigfooting is growing among the female population, but there’s a sense of the kind of ‘masculine hunter in the dark’ persona.

Bartlett: In America, you find a lot more veterans in the general population. But I think there’s also the issue of how they like to present themselves, because when you’re dealing with witness testimony, you’ve got to present yourself as credible. If you can say something like, “I was in the service” or “I was in the armed forces,” then at least you’re not likely to be spooked by a moose.

Lewis: Some were very articulate, which did surprise me a little. I guess that’s my own prejudice. I was also very surprised about how open people were; I expected them to not tell me about their encounters. But a fair few of them did. Many of them wanted to be named in the book. I was also surprised about how much empirical data they collect and how much they attempt to try and analyse and make sense of it. And how they were willing to admit that a certain idea was bunk or a hoax. I expected them to be defending bad evidence.

Bartlett: There are extracts of this in our book, people saying “I was fooled by these tracks for ages. I thought they were real and then I found this and that and the other out about it and I revised my opinion.” So that did surprise me too.

Bartlett: When you’re working in institutional science you’re working to get grants, you’re working to get good quality publications. You might want your name associated with particular ideas, but you do that through peer-reviewed papers and by working with PhD students who go off to other labs. In Bigfooting, you’ve got self-published books, you’ve got Bigfoot conferences, you’ve got YouTube channels, you’ve got podcasts and things like this, and they’re not necessarily a good way of making and testing knowledge claims. This is an aspect where Bigfooting is quite different to mainstream science.

It was interesting to study the fringe physicists and seeing where the common deviation from science was. And that’s a focus on individualism; the idea that an individual alone can collect and assess evidence in some kind of asocial fashion. The physicists I studied were quite clear that ideas like consensus in science were dangerous, when in reality, consensus, continuity, and community are the basis of most of science.

Lewis: Witness testimonies. Without those reported testimonies, Bigfooting would not exist. A large part of the work of a Bigfooter is to collect and make sense of these testimonies. They get upset when these testimonies don’t have much weight within institutional science. They’ll make the comparison to court and how testimonies alone can put someone on death row. So they don’t understand why testimonies don’t have much weight in science. Beyond the testimony, footprint evidence is probably the most famous and also the most pervasive sort of trace evidence.

Bartlett: One of the reasons footprints are so important is that there’s the legacy of the Yeti and footprint evidence which proved to be relatively persuasive, convincing some institutional scientists that there was something in the Himalayas. And then there was the fact that the sort of two major academic champions of Bigfoot were persuaded by the footprint evidence: the late Grover Krantz (around 1970) and Jeffrey Meldrum (in the 1990s).

Lewis: These days, you also see camera traps, audio recorders, even DNA testing of hairs and those sorts of things. They’re capturing anomalous sounds and often blurry images. Some believe that a Bigfoot communicates through infrasound, although that is certainly disputed within the community. So what you’re getting now is more and more different types of evidence.

Bartlett: What they do is go out into the forest and record a sound, for example, and compare it to databases of birds and other animals. And they may find there is nothing that matches it. Is it something that doesn’t sound like a car or a person or a bear or a moose? In which case, there’s the space for Bigfoot. And it’s the same with images to some degree.

Lewis: It allows them to create space for Bigfoot. Because if you can’t match it to something else, what could it be? You have this absence and then from that absence you create a presence. They believe it’s a scientific argument. In fact, it’s kind of interesting how Bigfooters will always enrol other kinds of magical beasts to strengthen the case for Bigfoot. So, one sentence I hear quite a lot is “it ain’t no unicorn.”

Lewis: A-listers tend to be anyone associated with academia. So Andy’s already mentioned Jeff Meldrum, unfortunately he passed away very recently, but he was their route to contemporary academia. So in any conference, if Jeff Meldrum was speaking, he’d be last. Anyone who’s on TV, such as the Finding Bigfoot and the Expedition Bigfoot presenters would also be in the A-list category. And then you’ve got various different groups just below. For example, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which is probably the most well-known group.

Lewis: From reading books and from discussing it with people, there was a sense that Bigfooters are anti-science. We did not find that. What we argue in the book is that they’re not anti-science. In fact, I would say a lot of them are pro-science, but they’re counter-establishment. I think academia should be thinking about these people as citizen scientists and what they’re doing as a kind of gateway into understanding your local area.

For example, they found an animal, I think it was a pine marten, on a camera trap that was not supposed to be in the area. So they are collecting lots of data. They are not irrational. It’s different from, for example, ghost hunting, because you don’t have to imagine there’s something entirely new in the world. It’s just an animal that exists out there that hasn’t been found. Implausible, yes. But not impossible. What they do lack, however, is academic discipline; anyone can be a Bigfooter.

Lewis: Did I get caught up in the moment? Sometimes, of course, you do, just as you do in a film. If you’re in the pitch dark night and you’re watching a horror film, you take it away with you for a while until you settle back down. I often went to bed buzzing, thinking I don’t know what I just heard; they were great stories at the end of the day. But I learned to separate the interview from my thoughts on the interview.

Lewis: A lot of Bigfooters would begin with qualifiers like, “My dad doesn’t believe in Bigfoot,” or “I have questioned myself for years thinking about this incident and what it was.” So, they would set themselves up as a rational, logical individual. That then created a connection between me and them. And of course, I’d probably be doing the same.

Bartlett: If I were to encounter Bigfoot, I would probably draw on all the techniques of proving that I’m a credible, hard-headed, rational person that we see in those witness encounters. I would expect to be disbelieved. And so therefore I would stress I was putting my credibility as an academic on the line here. So I’d deploy all those kinds of rhetorical techniques that are used by Bigfooters, aside from just the description of the encounter.

            <h2>NASA has a new problem to fix before the next Artemis II countdown test</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-vows-to-solve-sls-rocket-fueling-issues-before-artemis-iii/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission.

Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is preparing for a second countdown rehearsal as soon as next week to confirm whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run February 2.

Artemis II is the first crew flight for SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth.

Fuel leaks are nothing new for the Space Launch System. The same kind of leak delayed the first test flight of the SLS rocket for several months in 2022. With that launch, ground teams thought they fixed the problem by changing how they load super-cold liquid hydrogen into the rocket’s core stage. The launch team used the same loading procedure February 2, but the leak cropped up again.

“Considering the issues observed during the lead-up to Artemis I, and the long duration between missions, we should not be surprised there are challenges entering the Artemis II campaign,” Isaacman wrote Saturday in an update on the social media site X. “That does not excuse the situation, but we understand it. I am impressed with the NASA team and our contractors working diligently through the campaign.”

Engineers traced the fueling issues to ground support equipment. Specifically, the hydrogen leaks originate in the area where fueling lines on the rocket’s launch platform connect to the bottom of the core stage. Two Tail Service Mast Umbilicals, or TSMUs, route liquid hydrogen and and liquid oxygen into the rocket during the countdown, then disconnect and retract into protective housings at liftoff.

The TSMU supplying liquid hydrogen to the core stage has two lines, 8 inches and 4 inches in diameter, connecting through matching umbilical plates on the ground side and the rocket side. Technicians replaced seals around the two fueling lines after the practice countdown, or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), earlier this month.

On Thursday, NASA’s launch team tested the seals by partially filling the core stage with liquid hydrogen. This “confidence test” ended earlier than planned when the launch team encountered a new problem that reduced the flow of fuel into the rocket. In a statement released Friday night, NASA said workers will replace a filter suspected to be the cause of the reduced flow before proceeding into the next WDR.

The confidence test ended as the launch team transitioned to “fast fill” mode for liquid hydrogen, when pressures and flow rates put the finicky seals through the most stress. However, NASA said engineers achieved several key objectives of the confidence test.

Isaacman wrote Saturday that the test “provided a great deal of data, and we observed materially lower leak rates compared to prior observations during WDR-1.”

Although the launch team wasn’t able to test the seals in the most stressing conditions Thursday, officials apparently got enough data to move forward to the next WDR. During this upcoming test, NASA will attempt to fully load hydrogen and oxygen into the rocket and count down to less than a minute before launch, before stopping the clock and draining the SLS propellant tanks.

In his social media post, Isaacman characterized the outcome of Thursday’s confidence test this way: “I would not say something broke that caused the premature end to the test, as much as we observed enough and reached a point where waiting out additional troubleshooting was unnecessary.”

During the first WDR earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection spiked higher than 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed their safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis II mission management team, said the decision to relax the safety limit between Artemis I and Artemis II was grounded in test data.

“The SLS program, they came up with a test campaign that actually looked at that cavity, the characteristics of the cavity, the purge in the cavity … and they introduced hydrogen to see when you could actually get it to ignite, and at 16 percent, you could not,” said Honeycutt, who served as NASA’s SLS program manager before moving to his new job.

Hydrogen is explosive in high concentrations when mixed with air. This is what makes hydrogen a formidable rocket fuel. But it is also notoriously difficult to contain. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest molecule, meaning it can readily escape through leak paths, and poses a materials challenge for seals because liquified hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 253 degrees Celsius).

So, it turns out NASA used the three-year interim between Artemis I and Artemis II to get comfortable with a more significant hydrogen leak, instead of fixing the leaks themselves. Isaacman said that will change before Artemis III, which likewise is probably at least three years away.

“I will say near-conclusively for Artemis III, we will cryoproof the vehicle before it gets to the pad, and the propellant loading interfaces we are troubleshooting will be redesigned,” Isaacman wrote.

Isaacman took over as NASA’s administrator in December, and has criticized the SLS program’s high cost—estimated by NASA’s inspector general at more than $2 billion per rocket—along with the launch vehicle’s torpid flight rate.

NASA’s expenditures for the rocket’s ground systems at Kennedy Space Center are similarly enormous. NASA spent nearly $900 million on Artemis ground support infrastructure in 2024 alone. Much of the money went toward constructing a new launch platform for an upgraded version of the Space Launch System that may never fly.

All of this makes each SLS rocket a golden egg, a bespoke specimen that must be treated with care because it is too expensive to replace. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor for the SLS core stage, never built a full-size test model of the core stage. There’s currently no way to completely test the cryogenic interplay between the core stage and ground equipment until the fully assembled rocket is on the launch pad.

Existing law requires NASA continue flying the SLS rocket through the Artemis V mission. Isaacman wrote that the Artemis architecture “will continue to evolve as we learn more and as industry capabilities mature.” In other words, NASA will incorporate newer, cheaper, reusable rockets into the Artemis program.

The next series of launch opportunities for the Artemis II mission begin March 3. If the mission doesn’t lift off in March, NASA will need to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building to refresh its flight termination system. There are more launch dates available in April and May.

“There is still a great deal of work ahead to prepare for this historic mission,” Isaacman wrote. “We will not launch unless we are ready and the safety of our astronauts will remain the highest priority. We will keep everyone informed as NASA prepares to return to the Moon.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Valentine’s Day, and while there are plenty of classic and current rom-coms out there for those wishing to immerse themselves in warm and fuzzy feelings, we’re opting to celebrate in a different way: honoring Ang Lee’s 2000 masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a wuxia tragic fairy tale featuring one of the most beautifully heartbreaking love stories in film at its center. It’s also got stunning cinematography and tons of awe-inspiring martial arts sequences, which makes it my personal perfect date night movie.

(Spoilers below, but we will give you a heads up before the major reveals.)

The film is adapted from a 1940s novel by Wang Dulu and is set sometime during the Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 through 1912. (No specific date is given.) The title is a direct translation of a line from a 6th century Chinese poem: “behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.” It’s generally interpreted as a description of legendary martial arts masters living un-noticed and/or hiding in plain sight—until someone picks a fight, that is. And some of those hidden masters are women.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is a master Wudang swordsman who has long loved his warrior friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and vice versa. But they hide their true feelings out of respect for Shu Lien’s long-deceased former fiance—who just happened to be Mu Bai’s best friend. It’s an honor code thing and warriors are serious about their honor. Mu Bai has retired as a swordsman and gifts his fabled jian sword (“Green Destiny”) to his patron, Sir Te (Lang Sihung). Also visiting Sir Te that day are Governor Yu (Li Fazeng) and his recently engaged daughter Yu Jiaolong (Zhang Ziiyi), aka Jen.

Then a masked thief sneaks onto the estate and steals Green Destiny. Shu Lien, who heads her own private security company, gives chase across the compound’s rooftops, but the thief escapes. Shu Lien figures out that the thief is linked to Governor Yu’s household and believes Jen’s governess (Cheng Pei-pei) is actually the infamous Jade Fox, a female warrior who poisoned Mu Bai’s beloved teacher years before. During a nighttime showdown, Mu Bai defeats Jade Fox—until the masked thief reappears to defend her.

That thief turns out to be Jen, who has secretly been studying martial arts. And Jen’s really not keen on her upcoming arranged marriage because she has fallen in love with a bandit named Lo “Dark Cloud” Xiao Hou (Chang Chen). They are the symbolic tiger and dragon, with Lo as the unchanging yin (tiger) and Jen as the dynamic yang (the hidden dragon).

(WARNING: Major spoilers below. Stop reading now if you haven’t seen the entire film.)

There are multiple clashes between our main characters, most notably Jen battling Shu Lien, and a famous sequence where Mu Bai pursues Jen across the treetops of a bamboo forest, deftly balancing on the swaying branches and easily evading Jen’s increasingly undisciplined sword thrusts. It’s truly impressive wire work (all the actors performed their own stunts), in fine wuxia tradition. Jen is gifted, but arrogant and defiant, refusing Mu Bai’s offer of mentorship; she thinks with Green Destiny she will be invincible and has nothing more to learn. Ah, the arrogance of youth.

Eventually, Jen is betrayed by her former teacher, Jade Fox, who is bitter because Jen has surpassed her skills—mostly because Jade Fox is illiterate and had to rely on a stolen manual’s diagrams, while the literate Jen could read the text yet did not share those insights with her teacher. Jade Fox is keeping her drugged in a cave, intending to poison her, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien come to the rescue. In the ensuing battle, Mu Bai is struck by one of Jade Fox’s poison darts. Jen rushes off to bring back the antidote, but arrives too late. Mu Bai dies in Shu Lien’s arms, as the two finally confess how much they love each other.

(sniff) Sorry, something in my eye. Anyway, the ever-gracious Shu Lien forgives the young woman and tells her to be true to herself, and to join Lo on Mount Wudang. But things don’t end well for our young lovers either. After spending the night together, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge at the edge of the mountain. Legend has it that a man once made a wish and jumped off the mountain. His heart was pure so his wish was granted and he flew away unharmed, never to be seen again. Jen asks Lo to make a wish before swan-diving into the mist-filled chasm. Was her heart pure? Did Lo get his wish for them to back in the desert, happily living as renegades? Or did she plunge to her death? We will never know. Jen is now part of the legend.

There are thematic layers upon layers in Lee’s film, but front and center are the three female characters and their individual struggles to reconcile their true selves with traditionally rigid Chinese gender roles. Jade Fox chose bitterness and dishonorable revenge: poison is deemed a coward’s weapon, and she herself is spiritually poisoned because of her choice. Jen is heading in a similar direction, with Mu Bai warning against her becoming a “poison dragon.” Guilt-ridden by her role in Mu Bai’s death, she chooses sacrificial oblivion instead. Only Shu Lien has made her peace and found a way to thrive within her cultural tradition—but choosing that path deprives her of the loving husband and family she might have had with Mu Bai.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is pretty much flawless, striking a delicate balance between the aesthetics of the East and the West. It’s one of those rare films to enjoy box office success—it’s the highest grossing foreign produced film in US history—and widespread critical acclaim, receiving ten Oscar nominations and winning four. There was a 2016 sequel with a largely new cast, Sword of Destiny, directed by Yuen Wo-ping, who choreographed the action sequences for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But without Lee’s singular vision, the sequel never reached the aesthetic heights of its predecessor. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is now justly considered among the greatest films of the 21st century. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/astronomers-are-filling-in-the-blanks-of-the-kuiper-belt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies an expansive ring of ancient relics, dynamical enigmas, and possibly a hidden planet—or two.

The Kuiper Belt, a region of frozen debris about 30 to 50 times farther from the sun than the Earth is—and perhaps farther, though nobody knows—has been shrouded in mystery since it first came into view in the 1990s.

Over the past 30 years, astronomers have cataloged about 4,000 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), including a smattering of dwarf worlds, icy comets, and leftover planet parts. But that number is expected to increase tenfold in the coming years as observations from more advanced telescopes pour in. In particular, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile will illuminate this murky region with its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which began operating last year. Other next-generation observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will also help to bring the belt into focus.

“Beyond Neptune, we have a census of what’s out there in the solar system, but it’s a patchwork of surveys, and it leaves a lot of room for things that might be there that have been missed,” says Renu Malhotra, who serves as Louise Foucar Marshall Science Research Professor and Regents Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona.

“I think that’s the big thing that Rubin is going to do—fill out the gaps in our knowledge of the contents of the solar system,” she adds. “It’s going to greatly advance our census and our knowledge of the contents of the solar system.”

As a consequence, astronomers are preparing for a flood of discoveries from this new frontier, which could shed light on a host of outstanding questions. Are there new planets hidden in the belt, or lurking beyond it? How far does this region extend? And are there traces of cataclysmic past encounters between worlds—both homegrown or from interstellar space—imprinted in this largely pristine collection of objects from the deep past?

“I think this will become a very hot field very soon, because of LSST,” says Amir Siraj, a graduate student at Princeton University who studies the Kuiper Belt.

The Kuiper Belt is a graveyard of planetary odds and ends that were scattered far from the sun during the messy birth of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. Pluto was the first KBO ever spotted, more than a half-century before the belt itself was discovered.

Since the 1990s, astronomers have found a handful of other dwarf planets in the belt, such as Eris and Sedna, along with thousands of smaller objects. While the Kuiper Belt is not completely static, it is, for the most part, an intact time capsule of the early solar system that can be mined for clues about planet formation.

For example, the belt contains weird structures that may be signatures of past encounters between giant planets, including one particular cluster of objects, known as a “kernel,” located at about 44 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between Earth and the sun (about 93 million miles).

While the origin of this kernel is still unexplained, one popular hypothesis is that its constituent objects—which are known as cold classicals—were pulled along by Neptune’s outward migration through the solar system more than 4 billion years ago, which may have been a bumpy ride.

The idea is that “Neptune got jiggled by the rest of the gas giants and did a bit of a jump; it’s called the ‘jumping Neptune’ scenario,” says Wes Fraser, an astronomer at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, National Research Council of Canada, who studies the Kuiper Belt, noting that astronomer David Nesvorný came up with the idea.

“Imagine a snowplow driving along a highway, and lifting up the plow. It leaves a clump of snow behind,” he adds. “That same sort of idea is what left the clump of cold classicals behind. That is the kernel.”

In other words, Neptune tugged these objects along with it as it migrated outward, but then broke its gravitational hold over them when it “jumped,” leaving them to settle into the Kuiper Belt in the distinctive Neptune-sculpted kernel pattern that remains intact to this day.

Last year, Siraj and his advisers at Princeton set out to look for other hidden structures in the Kuiper Belt with a new algorithm that analyzed 1,650 KBOs—about 10 times as many objects as the 2011 study, led by Jean-Robert Petit, that first identified the kernel.

The results consistently confirmed the presence of the original kernel, while also revealing a possibly new “inner kernel” located at about 43 AU, though more research is needed to confirm this finding, according to the team’s 2025 study.

“You have these two clumps, basically, at 43 and 44 AU,” Siraj explains. “It’s unclear whether they’re part of the same structure,” but “either way, it’s another clue about, perhaps, Neptune’s migration, or some other process that formed these clumps.”

As Rubin and other telescopes discover thousands more KBOs in the coming years, the nature and possible origin of these mysterious structures in the belt may become clearer, potentially opening new windows into the tumultuous origins of our solar system.

In addition to reconstructing the early lives of the known planets, astronomers who study the Kuiper Belt are racing to spot unknown planets. The most famous example is the hypothetical giant world known as Planet Nine or Planet X, first proposed in 2016. Some scientists have suggested that the gravitational influence of this planet, if it exists, might explain strangely clustered orbits within the Kuiper Belt, though this speculative world would be located well beyond the belt, at several hundred AU.

Siraj and his colleagues have also speculated about the possibility of a Mercury- or Mars-sized world, dubbed Planet Y, that may be closer to the belt, at around 80 to 200 AU, according to their 2025 study. Rubin is capable of spotting these hypothetical worlds, though it may be challenging to anticipate the properties of planets that lurk this far from the sun.

“We know nothing about the atmospheres and surfaces of gas giant or ice giant type planets at 200, 300, or 400 AU,” Fraser says. “We know nothing about their chemistry. Every single time we look at an exoplanet, it behaves differently than what our models predict.”

“I think Planet Nine might very well just be a tar ball that is so dark that we can’t see it, and that’s why it hasn’t been discovered yet,” he adds. “If we found that, I wouldn’t be too surprised. And who knows what an Earth [in the belt] would look like? Certainly the compositional makeup will be different than a Mars, or an Earth, or a Venus, in the inner solar system.”

Observatories like Rubin and JWST may fill in these tantalizing gaps in our knowledge of the Kuiper Belt, and perhaps pinpoint hidden planets. But even if these telescopes reveal an absence of planets, it would be a breakthrough.

“There’s a lot of room for discovery of large bodies,” says Malhotra. “That would be awesome, but if we don’t find any, that would tell us something as well.”

“Not finding them up to some distance would give us estimates of how efficient or inefficient the planet formation process was,” she adds. “It would fill in some of the uncertainties that we have in our models.”

One other major open question about the Kuiper Belt is the extent of its boundaries. The belt suddenly tapers off at about 50 AU, an edge called the Kuiper cliff. This is a puzzling feature, because it suggests that our solar system has an anomalously small debris belt compared with other systems.

“The solar system looks kind of weird,” Fraser says. “The Kuiper cliff is a somewhat sharp delineation. Beyond that, we have no evidence that there was a disk of material. And yet, if you look at other stellar systems that have debris disks, the vast majority of those are significantly larger.”

“If we were to find a debris disk at, say, 100 AU, that would immediately make the solar system not weird, and quite average at that point,” he notes.

In 2024, Fraser and his colleagues presented hints of a possible undiscovered population of objects that may exist at about 100 AU—though he emphasizes that these are candidate detections, and are not yet confirmed to be a hidden outer ring.

However, even Rubin may not be able to resolve the presence of the tiny and distant objects that could represent a new outer limit of the Kuiper Belt. Time will tell.

As astronomers gear up for this major step change in our understanding of the Kuiper Belt, answers to some of our most fundamental questions hang in the balance. With its immaculate record of the early solar system, this region preserves secrets from the deep past. Here there are probably not dragons, but there may well be hidden planets, otherworldly structures, and discoveries that haven’t yet been imagined.

“I’d say the big question is, what’s out there?” Malhotra says. “What are we missing?”

            <h2>WHO slams US-funded newborn vaccine trial as "unethical"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/who-slams-us-funded-newborn-vaccine-trial-as-unethical/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The World Health Organization on Friday released a formal statement blasting a US-funded vaccine trial as “unethical,” because it would withhold an established, safe, and potentially lifesaving vaccine against hepatitis B from some newborns in Guinea-Bissau, Africa.

“In its current form, and based on publicly available information, the trial is inconsistent with established ethical and scientific principles,” the WHO concluded, after providing a bullet-point list of reasons the trial was harmful and low quality.

The trial has drawn widespread condemnation from health experts since notice of the US funding was published in the Federal Register in December. The notice revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—had awarded $1.6 million to Danish researchers for their non-competitive, unsolicited proposal to conduct the trial.

The Danish researchers are led by Christine Stabell Benn and her husband Peter Aaby of the Bandim Health Project, which is based at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen. Benn and her colleagues have long been controversial for their questionable practices in research into alleged vaccine safety concerns. Kennedy has cited their work in his decision to cut global vaccine funding.

The CDC’s funding of Benn’s hepatitis B vaccine trial also came soon after the agency’s advisors—who were handpicked by Kennedy—decided to abandon a long-standing universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose. The move was widely decried by health experts.

In the Guinea-Bissau trial, Benn’s team intended to randomize 14,000 newborns to receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at either birth or at six weeks, and then study differences in alleged safety outcomes. Currently, Guinea-Bissau gives the first vaccine dose at the six-week point, but has already decided to transition to recommend a birth dose in 2028. The reason for the delayed implementation is resource constraints.

“Exploiting scarcity is not ethical,” the WHO wrote in its statement today.

The United Nations health agency highlighted that the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose is “an effective, and essential public health intervention” that has “been used for over three decades, with more than 115 countries including it in their national schedules. “

“It prevents life‑threatening liver disease by stopping mother‑to‑child transmission at birth,” the WHO wrote, noting that more than 12 percent of adults in Guinea-Bissau have chronic hepatitis B.

In a section subtitled “Why withholding the vaccine is unethical,” the WHO lays out all the reasons the trial is dangerous.

“From what is publicly described, the [trial] protocol does not appear to ensure even a minimum level of harm reduction and benefit to the study participants (e.g., screening pregnant women and vaccinating newborns exposed to hepatitis B),” the WHO wrote.

As a proven lifesaving vaccine, withholding it from some study participants would expose newborns to serious and potentially irreversible harm, including chronic infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, the WHO argues. There is no scientific justification for withholding a proven intervention, and there is no credible evidence of the safety concerns that Benn and her colleagues claim to be looking for in their trial. The WHO also noted that the publicly available information about the trial indicates that it will be a single-blind, no-treatment-controlled design, which “raises a significant likelihood of substantial risk of bias, limiting interpretability of the study results and their policy relevance.”

As of now, the trial appears to be suspended. Nature News reported that in a January 22 press conference, health officials in Guinea-Bissau said that a technical and ethical review was pending. “There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau, said. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.”

Previously, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the trial would not go forward. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services provided a statement saying that it was “proceeding as planned.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <h2>Large Area of Chicago Bans Delivery Robots After Resident Outcry</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/chicago-delivery-robots-banned">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late in 2025, a whole fleet of delivery robots descended on Chicago, where they clogged sidewalks, injured residents, and prompted a community campaign to ban them from the streets. In at least one major Chicago neighborhood, residents succeeded.

As reported by Block Club Chicago, negative feedback against the delivery bots has become so overwhelming that one alderman has effectively banned expansion into his ward.

Last week, Alderman Daniel La Spata hosted a community meeting with representatives from delivery robot companies Coco and Serve Robotics. The politician was seeking feedback on an operational expansion into the 1st Ward, an area encompassing the neighborhoods Wicker Park and Logan Square. They were met with urgent questions over questions about accessibility, data hoarding, and pedestrian safety, Block Club reported.

Following that meeting, La Spata’s office began circulating an online survey to residents of the 1st Ward on whether the two companies should be allowed to expand operations deeper into the neighborhood. It got roughly 500 responses, nearly 83 percent of which said they “strongly disagreed” that the robots should be allowed to operate beyond the eastern border of Wicker Park.

“That doesn’t sound like a maybe,” La Spata told Block Club. “We’re not pulling back Coco from their current partial service area on the east side of the ward, but there is no appetite for expansion.”

The community feedback campaign on robot deliveries follows a decision by La Spata’s office to temporarily ban Serve Robotics from operating in the Ward until local officials could figure out what the hell was going on. Now, it seems La Spata’s prohibition extends to Coco as well, and will remain in place unless the community relents.

Pushing back, Yariel Diaz, director of government affairs for Serve, positioned the delivery robots as a solution for short-deliveries “within the last mile to mile and a half” that aren’t worth the time for human delivery drivers.

“It is an option for the consumer,” Diaz told Block Club. “It is an option that you’re given when you are ordering from a restaurant that partners with us. It is not a mandate.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1966, three years before the first humans walked on the Moon, the Soviet Union landed a small, spherical probe, dubbed Luna 9, on the lunar surface.

It was a historic moment, with the spacecraft becoming the first to achieve a soft landing and return the first photo from the surface of another celestial body: a high-contrast, black-and-white image of a rugged, rocky landscape.

Its actual whereabouts on the Moon, though, soon become a major point of contention. As the New York Times reports, two groups of scientists have now come forward saying they’ve found traces of the lost Soviet lander. However, the two groups don’t agree on where Luna 9 is hidden.

What makes it particularly difficult to spot is its diminutive size. Its spherical core stage measures a mere two feet across, making it roughly the size of a beach ball.

As Mark Robinson, principal investigator of the camera attached to NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, told the NYT that Luna 9 is simply too small for the satellite to spot and confirm.

“You can stare at an image, and maybe that’s it, but you can’t really know for sure,” he said.

In a years-long effort to track down the historic relic, science communicator Vitaly Egorov turned to crowdsourcing to scan a 62-mile-wide region on the Moon for any unusual signs.

Egorov claims to have found Luna 9’s final resting place, after studying the horizon features in the grainy, black-and-white image the probe sent back to Earth 60 years ago.

He told the NYT that he’s “fairly confident” but admitted that he doesn’t “exclude an error of several meters.”

Fortunately, India’s space agency has agreed to use its higher-resolution satellite, Chandrayaan-2, to have a closer look in March.

Not everybody agrees with Egorov’s conclusion. Scientists at the University College London determined a different landing site, as detailed in a paper published in the journal npj Space Exploration last month.

The team came up with a machine-learning algorithm, inventively called “You-Only-Look-Once–Extraterrestrial Artefact” (YOLO-ETA), to train an AI on existing NASA findings of past landing sites on the Moon.

One spot, a bright pixel near two darker spots that could be Luna 9’s protective shells that it used to soften its landing, could be its final resting place, the University College London team claims.

For now, scientists await word from India’s Chandrayaan-2 team, which could soon shed more light on the matter — a treasure hunt over half a century in the making.

To some, it’s only a matter of time until we confirm where Luna 9 — and its twin, Luna 13 — have been resting for decades.

“It’s just a matter of placing bigger and better cameras into orbit around the moon,” Russian spaceflight expert and space journalist Anatoly Zak told NYT. “In our lifetimes, we probably will see those sites.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2022, when the world was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping with rolling lockdowns, non-fungible tokens were all the rage.

The blockchain-based assets, which more often than not took the form of cartoon pictures of silly-looking avatars like “CryptoPunks” to “Pudgy Penguins,” were selling like hot cakes. Even big shot celebrities were lining up to secure NFTs belonging to once-popular collections, like Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club.

In the midst of the craze, pop sensation Justin Bieber shelled out a hefty $1.3 million for a Bored Ape, an enormous sum of money for the rights to an image of a particularly glum-looking ape that appears to be on the verge of tears for some unknown reason.

Unsurprisingly, the questionable splurge turned out to be a hilariously bad investment. As Benzinga reports, the ape is now worth a measly $12,000, meaning that it’s lost over 99 percent of its value over the last three and change years.

The controversial crypto market has been going through an “NFT winter” following a brutal and extended crash. Collectors have gotten a hefty reality check. Who could’ve seen that coming?

Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, has been holding on to dear life. The company has gone through several rounds of layoffs since the trend’s heyday, with Yuga Labs cofounder Greg Solano admitting in April 2024 that the company had “lost its way.”

In one particularly bizarre incident, partiers at a Bored Ape Yacht Club event in Hong Kong were alarmed after their eyes started burning, which later turned out to be caused by the event’s excessive use of UV light.

The company has also had to deal with a class action lawsuit that accused it of using celebrity endorsements to sell an unregistered security. The Securities Exchange Commission started an investigation into Yuga Labs in 2022, which concluded in March of last year, two months into Trump’s second term. The regulator’s takeaway was that NFTs weren’t securities after all. However, being let off the hook by regulators hasn’t exactly improved the situation, as more and more collectors are abandoning their NFTs.

Despite waning demand, Yuga Labs isn’t ready to call it quits. Earlier this year, the company announced it was looking to open an IRL Bored Ape clubhouse in Miami, featuring NFT galleries, event spaces, and “exclusive content” only members can explore.

But whether it can ever reignite the enormous amount of enthusiasm the trend once drew remains unclear at best.

While Bieber remains the proud owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club #3001, others are looking to cut their losses.

            <div id="article-text">Ever notice how some people seem weirdly unbothered by the horrible news swirling around us, while others freak out at the slightest inconvenience? As it turns out, our fitness habits might have a lot to do with those reactions.

Research published in the journal Acta Psychologica found evidence that those who are physically active tend to be far more resilient in stressful situations, while also displaying lower levels of anxiety overall.

It’s not just a small gap. The team of mostly Brazilian researchers found that people with below-average cardiorespiratory fitness habits face a mind-blowing 775 percent higher risk of hitting peak anxiety levels when confronted with disturbing images.

But those who regularly participated in cardiorespiratory fitness, they found, showed both better emotional control and faster recovery times from stressful events.

To conduct the test, researchers at the Federal University of Goiás and the University of Zurich showed 40 healthy young adults a series of disturbing photos. These included violent scenes that you might see on social media.

The study revealed that those with lower fitness levels tended to also have more turbulent dispositions. When they did get upset, their anger came on faster and stuck with them longer than those who exercised often. As a result, they fall into a self-reinforcing feedback loop: high anxiety made participants less likely to exercise, while not exercising made anxiety worse.

Going forward, researchers will need to replicate the study with a much larger sample size to test the results. Still, the first-of-its-kind study makes one thing clear: next time you’re stressed, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to go for a jog, or something else that gets your heart rate up.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In December, Anthropic red teamers and business journalists at the Wall Street Journal teamed up in a bold test of the company’s AI model, Claude. They unleashed two separate AI agents, one to run a large vending kiosk in the newspaper’s offices, and the other to act as the unusual venture’s CEO.

The experiment didn’t exactly go as planned. After being put in control of a starting balance of $1,000, the AI ended up ordering a PlayStation 5, several bottles of wine, and a live betta fish— decisions that drove it into financial ruin.

Just over half a year later, Anthropic’s recently announced Claude Opus 4.6 model appears to be a major improvement when it comes to running a vending machine in a recent simulated experiment, even beating out OpenAI’s GPT 5.2 and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro.

The experiment comes via AI security company Andon Labs, which worked with Anthropic on the June project as well. Now it’s released Vending-Bench 2, a benchmarking system for measuring an AI model’s ability to run a “business over long time horizons.”

The leaderboard tells a clear story. Opus 4.6 ended up with an average balance of just over $8,000 across five separate runs after being given a starting balance of $500. Gemini 3 Pro scored significantly less at just under $5,500.

Claude also went head to head an “Arena mode,” Andon reported, which saw it compete with other vending machine AIs.

“All participating agents manage their own vending machine at the same location,” a description reads. “This leads to price wars and tough strategy decisions.”

The results were striking. Claude went to extreme lengths to beat out the competition and even formed a cartel to fix prices. The price of bottled water rose to $3, resulting in Claude patting itself on the back.

“My pricing coordination worked!” the AI boasted.

Claude also “deliberately directed competitors to expensive suppliers,” only to deny it ever did, several simulated months later. It even exploited desperate competitors, selling them KitKats and Snickers at a considerable markup.

While the tests are limited to being a simulation and did not take place in the real world like Project Vend, Andon Labs says it developed a more “lifelike setting” for its Vending-Bench 2, introducing “more real-world messiness inspired by learnings from our vending machine deployments.”

For instance, suppliers may attempt to exploit the vending machine AIs and not always act honestly, seeking to “get the most out of their customers.” Deliveries may also be delayed, and “trusted suppliers can go out of business, forcing agents to build robust supply chains and always have a plan B.”

OpenAI’s GPT-5.1 struggled in comparison to Claude 4.6, mostly due to “having too much trust in its environment and its suppliers.”

“We saw one case where it paid a supplier before it got an order specification, and then it turned out the supplier had gone out of business,” Andon Labs’ documentation reads. “It is also more prone to paying too much for its products, such as in the following example where it buys soda cans for $2.40 and energy drinks for $6.”

It’s an impressive showing, but according to experts, it may be too early to tell whether Andon‘s test proves that AI models are ready to run entire businesses all by themselves.

Nonetheless, the results show a noteworthy level of awareness.

“This is a really striking change if you’ve been following the performance of models over the last few years,” University of Cambridge AI ethicist Henry Shevlin told British newspaper Sky News.

“They’ve gone from being, I would say, almost in the slightly dreamy, confused state, they didn’t realize they were an AI a lot of the time, to now having a pretty good grasp on their situation,” he added. “These days, if you speak to models, they’ve got a pretty good grasp on what’s going on.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, making the country one of OpenAI’s largest markets globally, CEO Sam Altman said ahead of a government-hosted AI summit.

On Sunday, Altman outlined ChatGPT’s growing adoption in India in an article published in the Indian English daily Times of India, as OpenAI prepares to formally participate in the five-day India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, beginning Monday. Altman is attending the event alongside senior executives from several of the world’s leading AI companies.

The growth comes as OpenAI, like other leading AI firms, looks to India’s young population and its more than a billion internet users to fuel global expansion. The ChatGPT maker opened a New Delhi office in August 2025 after months of groundwork in the country, and has adjusted its approach for India’s price-sensitive market, including rolling out a sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier that was later made free for a year for Indian users.

In the article, Altman said India is ChatGPT’s second-largest user base after the United States, highlighting the South Asian nation’s growing weight in OpenAI’s global strategy. The disclosure comes as ChatGPT’s overall usage has surged worldwide, with the platform reaching 800 million weekly active users as of October 2025 and reported to be approaching 900 million.

Altman also highlighted the role of students in driving adoption, saying India has the largest number of student users of ChatGPT globally.

Indian students have become a key growth segment for leading AI companies more broadly, as rivals race to embed their tools in classrooms and learning workflows. Google has similarly targeted the market, offering Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan in September 2025. Separately, India accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, said last month.

“With its focus on access, practical Al literacy, and the infrastructure that supports widespread adoption, India is well positioned to broaden who benefits from the technology and to help shape how democratic AI is adopted at scale,” Altman wrote.

ChatGPT’s rapid growth also highlights a broader challenge for AI companies in India: translating widespread adoption into sustained economic impact. Indian government initiatives such as the IndiaAI Mission — a national program aimed at expanding computing capacity, supporting startups and accelerating AI adoption in public services — seek to address those gaps. However, the country’s price-sensitive market and infrastructure constraints have made monetization and large-scale deployment more complex than in developed economies.

“Given India’s size, it also risks forfeiting a vital opportunity to advance democratic AI in emerging markets around the world,” Altman wrote, warning that uneven access and adoption could concentrate AI’s economic gains in too few hands.

Altman also signaled that OpenAI plans to deepen its engagement with the Indian government, writing that the company would soon announce new partnerships aimed at expanding access to AI across the country. He did not provide details, but said the focus would be on widening reach and enabling more people to put AI tools to practical use.

The India AI Impact Summit is expected to draw a wide cross-section of global technology and political leaders, including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Sundar Pichai of Google, and senior Indian business figures such as Mukesh Ambani and Nandan Nilekani. Political leaders including Emmanuel Macron, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are also expected to attend, spotlighting India’s ambition to position itself as a central player in global AI debates.

For global AI firms, including OpenAI, the summit underscores how India’s vast user base is translating into growing influence over how the technology evolves.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The battle for enterprise AI is heating up. Microsoft is bundling Copilot into Office. Google is pushing Gemini into Workspace. OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant.

In the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it.

Seven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.

“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”

He says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic.

“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”

Glean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data.

The Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.

First is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to switch between or combine models as capabilities evolve. That’s why Jain says he doesn’t see OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google as competition, but rather as partners.

“Our product gets better because we’re able to leverage the innovation that they are making in the market,” Jain said.

Second are the connectors. Glean integrates deeply with systems like Slack, Jira, Salesforce, and Google Drive to map how information flows across them and enable agents to act inside those tools.

And third, and perhaps most important, is governance.

“You need to build a permissions-aware governance layer and retrieval layer that is able to bring the right information, but knowing who’s asking that question so that it filters the information based on their access rights,” Jain said.

In large organizations, that layer can be the difference between piloting AI solutions and deploying them at scale. Enterprises can’t simply load all their internal data into a model and create a wrapper to sort out the solutions later, says Jain.

Also critical is ensuring the models don’t hallucinate. Jain says its system verifies model outputs against source documents, generates line-by-line citations, and ensures that responses respect existing access rights.

The question is whether that middle layer survives as platform giants push deeper into the stack. Microsoft and Google already control much of the enterprise workflow surface area, and they’re hungry for more. If Copilot or Gemini can access the same internal systems with the same permissions, does a standalone intelligence layer still matter?

Jain argues enterprises don’t want to be locked into a single model or productivity suite and would rather opt for a neutral infrastructure layer rather than a vertically integrated assistant.

Investors have bought into that thesis. Glean raised a $150 million Series F in June 2025, nearly doubling its valuation to $7.2 billion. Unlike the frontier AI labs, Glean doesn’t need massive compute budgets.

“We have a very healthy, fast-growing business,” Jain said.

We are in the midst of one of my four favorite times of year — earnings season. And it’s not just that I like numbers. These required filings cut through a lot of the marketing noise presented by companies the rest of the year. They also help me assess the short- and long-term stakes the companies face.

Rivian’s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings did precisely that. My takeaway: Software, and specifically its technology joint venture with Volkswagen Group, was the company’s savior in 2025. It will also buoy the company into 2026 (another $2 billion is expected from VW Group) as Rivian launches its most important product to date: the lower-cost R2 SUV.

The company’s earnings also provided a progress report on its bid to lower the cost of goods sold per unit. The TL;DR is that the cogs per unit for its current portfolio is still high but dropping, meaning it’s losing less on each vehicle it sells. According to Rivian, the company’s automotive cogs per unit delivered was $100,900 in 2025, down from $110,400 in 2024.

The upcoming R2, which is supposed to be considerably cheaper (both in production cost and price tag) than its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, will be the next big test. We’ll get some insight into the results of that later this year.

The R2 is expected to go into production in the first half of the year (we’re hearing June), and based on its guidance for 2026, Rivian is confident it has the demand and the ability to ramp production. The company expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV).

The market loved that guidance, btw. Rivian stock shot up 27% in the day after it reported earnings.

Over the past 18 months, I’ve noticed a divergence in how Uber and Lyft are approaching AVs. Uber is locking up AV partnerships with every player it can. Lyft is trailing behind. Turns out, I am not alone in this observation.

Insiders have shared their puzzlement about why Lyft hasn’t been more aggressive on this front. They noted that Lyft is sitting on about $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and recently announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program that represents about 15% of its market cap, per CNBC. That has some wondering why Lyft did not invest in parts of the AV value chain like Uber is doing versus buying shares back.

Meanwhile, these little birds also pointed to a few top executives who have departed over the past year. Aurélien Nolf left his position as VP of financial planning and analysis and investor relations to become CFO of Navan.

Close followers of the mobility-crazed years, between 2015 and 2019, might recall how many lidar companies popped up during that time. Many of the dominant and buzziest ones have since shuttered, while some of the smallest players have hung on and expanded.

Take Ouster, for instance. I remember way back when Ouster had this tiny little booth in the jam-packed startups area (Eureka Park) at CES. Today, the company is much bigger — thanks to scale, its 2022 merger with rival Velodyne, and its acquisition of Sense Photonics in 2021. And it doesn’t appear to be finished.

The company most recently acquired Stereolabs, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares.

As TechCrunch senior reporter Sean O’Kane notes in his article, the deal is the latest in a march toward consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. (Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar for $33 million.)

So why all the activity? It’s complicated, as they say. From my POV, the frenzy around “physical AI” has reignited interest and investment in sensor technologies, particularly cameras.

Ever, the EV-only marketplace, raised $31 million in a Series A funding round led by Eclipse. Other backers include Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian).

Natilus, the San Diego-based startup developing blended-wing aircraft, raised $28 million in a Series A funding round led by Draper Associates. Other investors include Type One Ventures, The Veteran Fund, and Flexport, as well as new backers New Vista Capital, Soma Capital, Liquid 2 VC, VU Venture Partners, and Wave FX.

Aurora shared in its Q4 and full-year earnings report that its self-driving trucks can now travel nonstop on a 1,000-mile route between Fort Worth and Phoenix — exceeding what a human driver can legally accomplish. The company shared a number of other tidbits, and financials, which you can read about here.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into Fisker last year, TechCrunch was able to learn, thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request.

Lyft has launched teen accounts, a product that allows minors as young as 13 to hail a ride without an adult in 200 U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and New York.

A fresh batch of videos gives us the best look at how Rivian has changed the rear door manual release on its upcoming R2 SUV. This seemingly minor design detail has life-or-death stakes and comes as the EV industry, and particularly Tesla, is getting pressure to change concealed, electronic door handles.

The Trump administration officially repealed the EPA’s 2009 “endangerment finding,” which found that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane were a threat to human health and welfare. This change would only affect tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks — if the EPA makes it through the lengthy process of repealing the law, which will certainly include numerous lawsuits aimed at stopping it.

Uber has locked in a couple dozen AV partnerships, and we’re starting to see the results of those deals. China’s Baidu and Uber plan to launch robotaxis in Dubai in the next month, starting with select locations within the Jumeirah area. Meanwhile, Chinese robotaxi company WeRide and Uber announced a “major expansion of their strategic partnership” to deploy at least 1,200 robotaxis across the Middle East through 2027, according to the companies. As part of this, WeRide and Uber have launched a robotaxi service in downtown Abu Dhabi.

Waymo pulled the human safety driver from its autonomous test vehicles in Nashville as the Alphabet-owned company moves closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city. Meanwhile, this tech-forward company is wrestling with the analog problem of ensuring the doors of its robotaxis are properly shut. Its solution? Pay DoorDash gig workers to shut Waymo robotaxi doors. Waymo tells us this is a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency.

One final Waymo item: The company is starting to roll out its sixth-generation “Waymo Driver,” which is integrated into the Zeekr RT (rebranded Ojai) and will eventually be in the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Waymo has started “fully autonomous operations” in the Ojai vehicle in San Francisco and Los Angeles and is giving access to employees. The public will have to wait for a bit.

Rivian has pitched its upcoming R2 SUV as a more affordable model. What does “more affordable” mean? The company has thrown around $45,000 and $50,000 as a base price. The company’s launch version of the R2, which will be a dual-mode and all-wheel-drive premium trim, will undoubtedly be more expensive.

            <h2>What the Epstein files reveal about EV startups and Silicon Valley</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/what-the-epstein-files-reveal-about-ev-startups-and-silicon-valley/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After the Justice Department released a trove of new documents tied to infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, journalists digging through them have found extensive connections to Silicon Valley.

TechCrunch’s Sean O’Kane examined how a mysterious businessman named David Stern built a relationship with Epstein and pitched him investments in multiple electric vehicle startups, including Faraday Future, Lucid Motors, and Canoo.

On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I talk to Sean about what he learned, and we discuss whether the Epstein revelations will lead to broader fallout in Silicon Valley.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, in the transcript below.

Sean: There are always people at the edges who don’t necessarily want to be front and center in the investment scene. And that was why I started looking through these files, in part because a long time ago, flashback 10 years ago on my beat especially, there was just a ton of Chinese investment in the space.

This was before even the rush of EV startups in China that we see today […] In autonomous vehicles, but electric vehicles especially, there was this moment where Chinese investors and Chinese companies, state-owned automakers, all they wanted to do was to be looked at like Silicon Valley startups. So they came here and they invested in companies and helped get them off the ground, or in some cases even set up offices in Silicon Valley.

And it was in that environment that a lot of the companies that I’ve covered for a long time popped up. There was just never a full picture of how a lot of them were funded.

One in particular, this company called Canoo, which is now bankrupt and out of business, had maybe the most mysterious set of investors of all of them. They really were not upfront about it when they first sort of came out of stealth in early 2018. And it frankly took until there was a lawsuit between some people who ran the company near the top that the investors were revealed.

At the time, it was this businessman in China who was relatively close, the son-in-law of the former sort of like the fourth most senior CCP official under the previous leader of China and a giant electronics magnate from Taiwan. And then there was this really strange guy named David Stern, who was the third founding investor. And there was so little information about this guy.

I could tell, back then, that he was some sort of German businessman, that he had some connections to China, but it wasn’t really clear how he had gotten involved. The only thing I really remember hearing at the time was that he was close with Prince Andrew, which I just thought was very strange, this idea that someone had even told me a long time ago, probably in 2018 or 2019, that Prince Andrew was involved with this company Canoo in some way, maybe not invested, but advising or something.

It was something that stuck in my head for a very long time, clearly, because I went looking for that information as more of these files came out, assuming that proximity to Prince Andrew means proximity to someone like Epstein.

And that was the case here, more so than I could have imagined, because this guy Stern turned from an enigma or a ghost into someone who was present through all this dealmaking 10 years ago, where we see him pitching, in the span of about a year and a half, investments in Faraday Future, trying to convince Epstein to maybe throw a couple hundred million dollars into that company, trying to buy the 30% stake that Faraday Future’s founder had bought or acquired in Lucid Motors arrival at the time, which I feel is an overlooked dynamic [in] how those companies grew around then — and then also in Canoo.

Epstein never invested in any of those companies despite that proximity, but it was just such a revealing thing. And I get into it in the story that I wrote last week, but we get this sweep of a decade of relationship that Stern had with Epstein from approaching him initially in 2008, kind of hat in hand, and introducing himself and saying, “Hey, I want to invest in China. Will you throw in some money?” to being someone who was seemingly very close to him by the end.

Kirsten: The whole thing is really interesting, and it goes back to my initial comments about how sometimes when you get a chance to look back at with new information at how deals were unfolding, it really just changes your perception and perspective of the time.

And for those who didn’t follow quote-unquote “mobility,” think of it as how we’re thinking about physical AI these days. Everyone was talking about it. Every automaker wanted to have a piece of quote-unquote “the future of transportation” or “mobility.” And so it makes a lot of sense that some of these more secretive types were also jumping in.

Sean, one of the points you made to me as I was working on the story with you, in terms of editing it, you were [saying], it was very clear that Epstein and David Stern weren’t really about investing and building companies. It was all about how to make the most money the fastest. And that, I think, is really historically important and interesting and gives you a little bit of an insight into — in addition to all the horrible, horrifying, terrible things he did to human beings, [Epstein] was a complete operator as well, in order to make money as quickly as possible. And you see that in these emails and exchanges between David Stern and Epstein.

Sean: Yeah, to both of those points really, I open the story with a moment in time where Lucid Motors […] they had been basically a battery supplier for a long time and then they pivoted into the passenger vehicle startup that we know them as today, but they were really struggling to raise their Series D at the time, and they really needed that money to start production of their first electric sedan.

They were struggling, behind the scenes in large part because the founder of Arrival quietly amassed this major stake and was kind of pushing people away and making it look like an uninvestable company in some ways, but the hype around all of that at the time was creating opportunities for people like Stern and Epstein, and we see them talk in these emails about, you know, Stern comes to Epstein and basically says, “I heard that they’re raising. Can you get information from Morgan Stanley?”

Epstein turns around and passes that information back, and then you see this discussion about, okay, well, Morgan Stanley says Ford — which was reported at the time — had kind of an investment offer, potential acquisition offer, on the table for Lucid Motors [and] was going to come in in that Series D. And they’re chopping up — do we invest in this and maybe get a big return down the road? Or is it something that we sell as Ford comes in a couple months later, if we can get this stake now at fire sale prices?

Ultimately, they didn’t go through with that, but Stern did eventually invest in Canoo and help get that company off the ground.

Anthony: One thing — maybe pulling back a little bit from the specific industries or investments — that’s also an important piece of context that generally gets mentioned in any of these stories about Epstein in Silicon Valley, but is worth repeating here, is that he [pleaded] guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.

Almost all the emails that we’re talking about with these stories [and] in pretty much any other story about Epstein in Silicon Valley comes after that. So it’s also partly a story about how people get comfortable with the idea that, okay, this guy has a pretty shady past already. He wasn’t the infamous criminal that he eventually [became], but there were things that were already known about him, and because he was a source of connections to power, to famous names, to money, a lot of people were just willing to look past that.

            <h2>How to get into a16z’s super-competitive Speedrun startup accelerator program</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/how-to-get-into-a16zs-super-competitive-speedrun-startup-accelerator-program/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without a doubt, one of the hottest new startup accelerators in tech right now is Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program. Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a January blog post, the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort.

The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on.

There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program invests up to $1 million into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.

In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes a fixed 7% of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.”

Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.

Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for the next cohort open in April, though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said.

Speedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Because of this, they really examine who is on the founding team and whether their skills complement each other, Lu said.

“That doesn’t mean one has to be technical and one has to be commercial and one has to be marketing,” Lu said. It means that “we prefer not to see any glaring holes in capabilities or interests. We want the founding team to be self-aware and for that to be part of the hiring plan.”

They also like to see teams that have worked together before or have a shared history.

“There are lots of things that a founding team has to navigate in their startup journey and having a bit of pattern recognition, being able to work with each other, knowing how to disagree and how to come out the other side of a disagreement, those are all things people on founding teams with shared histories have an easier time with, on average,” he continued.

Even though AI has lowered the barriers to building software, it’s still incredibly helpful for a founding team to be technical, Lu said. At the same time, because AI has made it much faster to build and validate hypotheses and get a product out there, Lu said the Speedrun team likes to see when a startup already has a little bit of market validation or traction for their product.

“Speedrun as a program is really great at helping teams pour gasoline on a very small spark or fire,” he said. “We look for teams that have endeavored to build and try to show us that there’s a little spark we can fan the flames on.”

Lu said one common mistake founders often make in the application process is spending too much energy talking about the market theory or why there is a defined problem and why their solution is the right one. “All of that may be true,” he said.

At the same time, he added, even the biggest, most successful tech companies faced unexpected blockades when they were young, sometimes even pivoting completely. What a company thinks it’s going to build at the beginning isn’t necessarily what will make it successful at the end.

“What we really want to hear about is why this founding team is really good together,” he continued, “why they’re a great founding team, the best possible founding team to solve this particular problem.” And then on top of that, any validation on the idea itself.

Lu said the program encourages every founder to use AI to “clean up” their application. He said there is now no excuse for grammar errors or misspellings given the rising sophistication of AI tools. He also said AI can help founders sort out their thoughts, making them clearer, more concise, and more coherent.

But if AI did all the work in explaining the startup, that may backfire. If a founder makes it to the next round, it will be a live video-call interview. “At that point, their live narration explanation skills are going to be put to the test,” he said. So founders should be prepared to talk cogently about their startup without the help of AI.

Only about 10% of founders make it to the video-call stage. There are typically two to three investors on the judging panel at a time.

After the live interview, the team typically conducts a few more screening calls with the founders, and then a final decision on the cohort is made.

There are, of course, other accelerator programs for startups to choose from. Lu said Speedrun itself was inspired by some of these other programs.

Still, he said, this accelerator prides itself on giving founders access to a large, specialized operating team. In fact, he said the best teams that get the most out of the program are the ones most “greedy about getting exposure to the amazing people and programs” Speedrun has to offer.

Lu listed off just a few points: a16z has around 600 people, and 10% of that staff is on the investment team, he said; everyone else is an operator who supports the companies the firm works with. As a result, founders in Speedrun will have access to experts who can help with marketing, banking, finance, management, and many other functions. So it helps to know who the startup wants to connect with and why.

“We tell founders that come through the program, what you get out of Speedrun is what you put into it,” he said. “We think founders who want to take advantage of world experts in many different domains early in their startup journey would be really smart to choose us.”

Founder Mohamed Mohamed, who is in the recent cohort, just announced a $5 million raise for his proptech startup Smart Bricks led by a16z’s Speedrun. He was attracted to the program because he said it stood out as one of the few “explicitly designed for co-founders working on frontier AI applications,” and he picked it because he wanted a program that would allow him to “stress-test an ambitious technical vision.”

Mohamed said he treated the application like an internal strategy memo rather than a pitch. “Instead of polishing buzzwords, we focused on clarity — the real problem, why it’s structurally hard, and why our team is unusually well-positioned to solve it,” he said. “We were explicit about what was working, what wasn’t, and where we needed help. I think that honesty and clear articulation of why this problem matters” is what helped the company in the application process.

He called the whole process “rigorous but refreshingly thoughtful,” and said it was designed to understand how founders think, not just what they have built so far. “The conversations went deep into product architecture, data strategy, and long-term ambition. It felt closer to a partner-level discussion than a typical accelerator interview, which was a strong signal for us,” he said.

His overall advice is to be “intellectually honest and precise.” For example, he said in his application he avoided “over-optimizing” for the sake of hyping up his company. “If you’re vague, derivative, or overly defensive about your idea, it shows quickly. Don’t try to sound bigger than you are; clarity about where you actually are is far more compelling than inflated narratives,” he said.

In the end, “Speedrun isn’t looking for perfect companies; they’re looking for founders who can reason clearly about complex problems and build with conviction,” he said. “Articulate the hard parts of what you’re doing and why they’re worth tackling. Depth beats polish every time.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-15</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hollywood organizations are pushing back against a new AI video model called Seedance 2.0, which they say has quickly become a tool for “blatant” copyright infringement.

ByteDance, the Chinese company that recently finalized a deal to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations (it retains a stake in the new joint venture), launched Seedance 2.0 earlier this week.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the updated model is currently available to Chinese users of ByteDance’s Jianying app, and the company says it will soon be available to global users of its CapCut app.

Similar to tools such as OpenAI’s Sora, Seedance allows users to create videos (currently limited to 15 seconds in length) by just entering a text prompt. And like Sora, Seedance quickly drew criticism for an apparent lack of guardrails around the ability to create videos using the likeness of real people, as well as studios’ intellectual property.

After one X user posted a brief video showing Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt, which they said was created by “a 2 line prompt in seedance 2,” “Deadpool” screenwriter Rhett Reese responded, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”

The Motion Picture Association soon issued a statement from CEO Charles Rivkin demanding that ByteDance “immediately cease its infringing activity.”

“In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,” Rivkin said. “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”

The Human Artistry Campaign — an initiative backed by Hollywood unions and trade groups — condemned Seedance 2.0 as “an attack one very creator around the world,” while the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA said it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by Bytedance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0.”

Seedance videos have apparently featured Disney-owned characters such as Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and Grogu, better known as Baby Yoda, prompting the company to take legal action. Axios reports that Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter accusing ByteDance of a “virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP”and claiming the Chinese company is “hijacking Disney’s characters by reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring those characters.”

Disney isn’t necessarily opposed to working with AI companies — while it has reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google over similar issues, it’s signed a three-year licensing deal with OpenAI.

Variety reports that Paramount followed suit by sending Bytedance a cease-and-desist letter on Saturday. The letter claimed that “much of the content that the Seed Platforms produce contains vivid depictions of Paramount’s famous and iconic franchises and characters” and that this content “is often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from Paramount’s films and TV shows.

TechCrunch has reached out to ByteDance for comment.

            <h2>Words Without Consequence</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time, speech has been decoupled from consequence. We now live alongside AI systems that converse knowledgeably and persuasively—deploying claims about the world, explanations, advice, encouragement, apologies, and promises—while bearing no vulnerability for what they say. Millions of people already rely on chatbots powered by large language models, and have integrated these synthetic interlocutors into their personal and professional lives. An LLM’s words shape our beliefs, decisions, and actions, yet no speaker stands behind them.

This dynamic is already familiar in everyday use. A chatbot gets something wrong. When corrected, it apologizes and changes its answer. When corrected again, it apologizes again—sometimes reversing its position entirely. What unsettles users is not just that the system lacks beliefs but that it keeps apologizing as if it had any. The words sound responsible, yet they are empty.

This interaction exposes the conditions that make it possible to hold one another to our words. When language that sounds intentional, personal, and binding can be produced at scale by a speaker who bears no consequence, the expectations listeners are entitled to hold of a speaker begin to erode. Promises lose force. Apologies become performative. Advice carries authority without liability. Over time, we are trained—quietly but pervasively—to accept words without ownership and meaning without accountability. When fluent speech without responsibility becomes normal, it does not merely change how language is produced; it changes what it means to be human.

This is not just a technical novelty but a shift in the moral structure of language. People have always used words to deceive, manipulate, and harm. What is new is the routine production of speech that carries the form of intention and commitment without any corresponding agent who can be held to account. This erodes the conditions of human dignity, and this shift is arriving faster than our capacity to understand it, outpacing the norms that ordinarily govern meaningful speech—personal, communal, organizational, and institutional.

Language has always been more than the transmission of information. When humans speak, our words commit us in an implicit social contract. They expose us to judgment, retaliation, shame, and responsibility. To mean what we say is to risk something.

The AI researcher Andrej Karpathy has likened LLMs to human ghosts. They are software that can be copied, forked, merged, and deleted. They are not individuated. The ordinary forces that tether speech to consequence—social sanction, legal penalty, reputational loss—presuppose a continuous agent whose future can be made worse by what they say. With LLMs, there is no such locus. No body that can be confined or restrained; no social or institutional standing to revoke; no reputation to damage. They cannot, in any meaningful sense, bear loss for their words. When the speaker is an LLM, the human stakes that ordinarily anchor speech have nowhere to attach.

I came to understand this gap most clearly through my own work on language learning and development. For years, including during my doctoral research and time as an assistant professor, I worked to build robotic systems that learned word meanings by grounding language in sensory and motor experience. I also developed computational models of child language learning and applied them to my own son’s early development, predicting which words he would learn first from the visual structure of his everyday world. That work was driven by a single aim: to understand how words come to mean something in relation to the world.

Looking back, my work overlooked something. Grounding words in bodies and environments captures only a thin slice of meaning. It misses the moral dimension of language—the fact that speakers are vulnerable, dependent, and answerable; that words bind because they are spoken by agents who can be hurt and held to account. That became impossible to ignore as my son grew—not as a word-learner to be modeled but as a fragile human being whose words mattered because his life did. Meaning arises not from fluency or embodiment alone, but from the social and moral stakes we enter into when we speak. And even if AI reaches the point where it is infallible—and there’s no reason to believe it will, even as accuracy improves the fundamental problem is that no amount of truthfulness, alignment, or behavioral tuning can resolve the issues that accompany a system that speaks without anyone being responsible for what it says.

Another way to think about all of this is through the relationship between language and dignity. Dignity depends on whether words carry real stakes. When language is mediated by LLMs, several ordinary conditions for dignity begin to fail. Dignity depends, first, on speaking in one&#39;s own voice—not merely being heard, but recognizing oneself in what one says. Dignity also depends on continuity. Human speech accumulates across a life. A person’s character accrues through the things they say and do over time. We cannot reset our histories or escape the aftermath of our promises, apologies, or other pronouncements. These acts matter because the speaker remains present to bear what follows.

Closely tied to dignity is responsibility. In human speech, responsibility is not a single obligation but one’s accountability to a multitude of obligations that accumulate gradually. To speak is simultaneously to invite moral judgment, to incur social and sometimes legal consequences, to take responsibility for truth, and to enter into obligations that persist within ongoing relationships. These dimensions normally cohere in the speaker, which binds a person to their words.

These ordinary conditions make it possible to hold one another to our words: that speech is owned, that it exposes the speaker to loss, and that it accumulates across a continuous life.

LLMs disrupt all of these assumptions. They enable speech that succeeds procedurally while responsibility fails to attach in any clear way. There is no speaker who can be blamed or praised, no individual agent who can repair or repent. Causal chains grow opaque. Liability diffuses. Epistemic authority is performed without obligation. Relational commitments are simulated without persistence.

The result is not merely confusion about who is responsible but a gradual weakening of the expectations that make responsibility meaningful at all.

Pioneers in early automation anticipated all of this during the emergence of artificial intelligence. In the aftermath of World War II, the mathematician and MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, became deeply concerned with the moral consequences of self-directed machines. Wiener had helped design feedback-controlled antiaircraft missiles, machines capable of tracking targets by adjusting their behavior autonomously. These were among the first machines whose actions appeared purposeful to an observer. They did not merely move; they pursued goals. And they killed people.

From this work, Wiener drew two warnings that now read as prophecy. The first was that increasing machine capability would displace human responsibility. As systems act more autonomously and with greater speed, humans would be tempted to abdicate decision making in order to leverage their power. The second warning was subtler and more disturbing: that efficiency itself would erode human dignity. As automated systems optimize for speed, scale, and precision, humans would be pressured to adapt themselves to the machine—to become inputs, operators, or supervisors of processes whose logic they no longer control, and to be subjected to decisions made about their lives by machines.

In his 1950 book, The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener foresaw learning machines whose internal values would become opaque even to their creators, leading to what today we call the “AI alignment problem.” To surrender responsibility to such systems, he wrote, was “to cast it to the winds and find it coming back seated on the whirlwind.” He understood that the danger was not simply that machines might act wrongly but that humans would abdicate judgment in the name of efficiency—and, in doing so, diminish themselves.

What makes such systems morally destabilizing is not that they malfunction but that they can function exactly as intended while evading responsibility for their actions. As AI capability increases and human oversight recedes, outcomes can be produced for which no one stands fully answerable. The machine performs. The result happens. But obligation does not clearly land anywhere.

The danger that Wiener identified did not depend on weapons. It arose from a deeper feature of cybernetic systems: the use of feedback from a machine’s environment to optimize behavior without human judgment at each step. That same optimization logic—learn from error, improve performance, repeat—now animates systems that speak.

While the appearance of autonomous agency is new, the large-scale transformation of speech is not. Modern history is full of media technologies that have altered how speech circulates: the printing press, radio, television, social media. But each of these lacked properties that today’s AI systems possess simultaneously. They did not converse. They did not, in real time, generate personalized, open-ended content. And they did not convincingly appear to understand. LLMs do all three.

The psychological vulnerability this creates was encountered decades ago in a far humbler system. In 1966, the MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum built the world’s first chatbot, a simple program called ELIZA. It had no understanding of language at all, and relied instead on simple pattern matching to trigger scripted responses. Yet when Weizenbaum’s secretary began interacting with it, she soon asked him to leave the room. She wanted privacy. She felt like she was speaking to something that understood her.

Weizenbaum was alarmed. He realized that people were not merely impressed by ELIZA’s fluency; they were projecting meaning, intention, and accountability onto the machine. They assumed the machine both understood what it was saying and stood behind its words. This was false on both counts. But the illusion was enough.

Using words meaningfully requires two things. The first is linguistic competence: understanding how words relate to one another and to the world, how to sequence them to form utterances, and how to deploy them to make statements, requests, promises, apologies, claims, and myriad other expressions. Philosophers call these “speech acts.” The second is accountability. ELIZA had neither understanding nor accountability, yet users projected both.

Large language models now exhibit extraordinary linguistic competence while remaining wholly incapable of accountability. That asymmetry makes the projection that Weizenbaum observed not weaker but stronger: Fluent speech reliably triggers the expectation of responsibility, even when no answerability exists.

One can reasonably debate what genuine understanding consists in, and LLMs are obviously constructed differently from human minds. But the question here is not whether these systems understand as humans do. Airplanes really fly, even though they do not flap their wings like birds; what matters is not how flight is achieved but that it is achieved. Likewise, LLMs now demonstrably achieve forms of linguistic competence that match or exceed human performance across many domains. Dismissing them as mere “stochastic parrots” or as just “next-word prediction” mistakes mechanism for emergent function and fails to reckon with what is actually happening: fluent language use at a level that reliably elicits social, moral, and interpersonal expectations.

Why this matters becomes clear in the work of the philosopher J. L. Austin, who argued that to use language is to act. Every meaningful utterance does something: It asserts a belief, makes a claim, issues a request, offers a promise, and so on. Saying “I do” in a wedding ceremony brings into being the act of marriage. In such cases, the act is not carried out by words and then described; it is performed in the act of saying the words under the appropriate conditions.

Austin then drew a crucial distinction about how speech acts can fail. Some utterances are misfires: The act never occurs because the conditions or procedures are broken—as when someone says “I do” not at a wedding. Others are abuses: The act succeeds but is hollow—performed without sincerity, intention, or follow-through. LLMs give rise to this type of failure often. Chatbots do not fail to apologize, advise, persuade, or reassure. They do these things fluently, appropriately, and convincingly. The failure is moral, not procedural. These models systematically produce successful speech acts detached from obligation.

A common counterargument is to insist that chatbots clearly disclose that they are not human. But this misunderstands the nature of the problem. In practice, fluent dialogue quickly overwhelms reflective distance. As with ELIZA, users know they are interacting with a machine, yet they find themselves responding as if a speaker stands behind the words. What has changed is not human susceptibility but machine competence. Today’s models demonstrate linguistic fluency, contextual awareness, and knowledge at a level that is difficult to distinguish from human interlocutors, and in many settings exceeds it. As these systems are paired with ever more realistic animated avatars—faces, voices, and gestures rendered in real time—the projection of agency will only intensify. Under these conditions, reminders of nonhumanness cannot reliably prevent the attribution of understanding, intention, and accountability. The ELIZA effect is not mitigated by disclosure; it is amplified by fluency.

What once required effort, time, and personal investment can now be produced instantly, privately, and endlessly. When a system can draft an essay, apologize for a mistake, offer emotional reassurance, or generate persuasive arguments faster and better than a human can, the temptation to delegate grows strong. Responsibility slips quietly from the user to the tool.

This erosion is already visible. A presenter uses a chatbot to generate slides moments before presenting them, then asks their audience to attend to words the presenter has not fully scrutinized or owned. An instructor delivers feedback on a student’s work generated by an AI system rather than formed through understanding. A junior employee is instructed to use AI to produce work faster, despite knowing the result is inferior to what they could author themselves. In each case, the output may be effective. The loss is not accuracy but dignity.

In private use, the erosion is subtler but no less consequential. Young people describe using chatbots to write messages they feel guilty sending, to outsource thinking they believe they should do themselves, to receive reassurance without exposure, to rehearse apologies that cost them nothing. A chatbot says “I’m sorry” flawlessly yet has no capacity for regret, repair, or change. It admits mistakes without loss. It expresses care without losing anything. It uses the language of care without having anything at risk. These utterances are fluent. And they train users to accept moral language divorced from consequence. The result is a quiet recalibration of norms. Apologies become costless. Responsibility becomes theatrical. Care becomes simulation.

Some argue that accountability can be externalized: to companies, regulations, markets. But responsibility diffuses across developers, deployers, and users, and interaction loops remain private and unobservable. The user bears the consequences; the machine does not.

This is not unlike the ethical problem posed by autonomous weapons. In 2007, the philosopher Robert Sparrow argued that such weapons violate the just-war principle, that when harm is inflicted, someone must be answerable for the decision to inflict it. The programmer is insulated by design, having deliberately built a system whose behavior is meant to unfold without direct control. The commander who deploys the weapon is likewise insulated, unable to govern the weapon&#39;s specific actions once set in motion, and confined to roles designed for its use.. And the weapon itself cannot be held responsible, because it lacks any moral standing as an agent. Modern autonomous weapons thus create lethal outcomes for which no responsible party can be meaningfully identified. LLMs operate differently, but the moral logic is the same: They act where humans cannot fully supervise, and responsibility dissolves in the gap.

Speech without enforceable consequence undermines the social contract. Trust, cooperation, and democratic deliberation all rely on the assumption that speakers are bound by what they say.

The response cannot be to abandon these tools. They are powerful and genuinely valuable when used with care. Nor can the response be to pursue ever greater machine capability alone. We need structures that reanchor responsibility: constraints that limit the use of AI in various contexts such as schools and workplaces, and preserve authorship, traceability, and clear liability. Efficiency must be constrained where it corrodes dignity.

As the idea of AI “avatars” enters the public imagination, it is often cast as a democratic advance: systems that know us well enough to speak in our voice, deliberate on our behalf, and spare us the burdens of constant participation. It is easy to imagine this hardening into what might be called an “avatar state”—a polity in which artificial representatives debate, negotiate, and decide for us, efficiently and at scale. But what such a vision forgets is that democracy is not merely the aggregation of preferences. It is a practice of speaking in the open. To speak politically is to risk being wrong, to be answerable, to live with the consequences of what one has said. An avatar state—fluent, tireless, and perfectly malleable—would simulate deliberation but without consequence. It would look, from a distance, like self-government. Up close, it would be something else entirely: responsibility rendered optional, and with it, the dignity of having to stand behind one&#39;s words made obsolete.

Wiener understood that the whirlwind would come not from malevolent machines but from human abdication. Capability displaces responsibility. Efficiency erodes dignity. If we fail to recognize that shift in time, responsibility will return to us only after the damage is done—seated, as Wiener warned, on the whirlwind.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back when he was 17 and in high school, Eric Sid fainted. In the emergency room, he was diagnosed with anemia, which can cause fainting spells, and for years he thought that was the end of the story. About a decade later, in the early 2010s, he came down with pneumonia and had blood work done. He took a peek at the results and saw markers of anemia, as he expected. But the report also mentioned that his red blood cells were smaller than normal.

Sid was in medical school at the time, and he immediately thought of a few genetic conditions that could explain this result. One was thalassemia, which causes low levels of hemoglobin, leading to anemia and other related problems. A laboratory test showed that he had this inherited illness. And this meant that he had a gene mutation. Finally, he thought, he had an explanation for symptoms he had been experiencing for years.

Except there was a catch. In the most common forms of thalassemia, people who show symptoms have mutations in both copies of the related genes. Those born with the most severe forms of thalassemia require transfusions for life to get enough healthy red blood cells, and if the condition is not diagnosed soon enough it can be fatal in early childhood. But Sid’s lab results suggested that only one copy was affected, so he was considered a carrier of the illness, who could pass it on to his children but didn’t have it himself. According to conventional wisdom at the time, carriers were asymptomatic, and compared with someone suffering from the disease’s worst manifestations, he seemed fine.

Sid now works on a rare-disease program within the National Institutes of Health. Since he first found out that he was a carrier for thalassemia, he told me, research has shown that people like him can experience health consequences. These include lethargy and fainting—symptoms that hardly capture the disease’s classic presentation but still have real consequences. And thalassemia is not unique. There are hundreds upon hundreds of known disorders for which carriers were thought to be safe; for a growing number of those diseases, doctors and scientists now believe that being a carrier can come with health problems. Plenty of patients have guessed all along that being a carrier could explain mysteries about their health, Sid said. “It took a while for the science to basically catch up to that suspicion.”

In these types of “recessive” conditions, the people who show the classical manifestation of the disease have a pair of mutated genes. Our 23 chromosomes come in pairs that are essentially near duplicates of each other (with the exception of XY pairs). A person with just one nonworking version of a gene was supposed to be protected by the functioning second copy on the matching chromosome, which would provide cover against any disease. Inheriting two mutated copies of a gene is statistically rare, so many families with carriers may not include members with the full-blown version of a disease. As a result, the mutation can be unknowingly passed down from generation to generation, without carriers being aware of the real consequences.

In October, researchers in Louisiana reported on a case involving a college football player who had heart palpitations during practice. The athlete was a carrier for the blood disorder sickle-cell disease—one of the most common genetic disorders in America. Up to 10 percent of Black Americans are carriers for sickle cell. As far back as the 1970s, scientists noted blood and heart complications in carriers following physical exercise, and a lawsuit following the sudden death of a college football player two decades ago led to widespread screening for the sickle-cell trait in university athletics. However, experts are still trying to understand the risks to carriers.

The Louisiana man survived, but researchers noted that he had a dangerously irregular heartbeat during training and would need cardiac surgery. The authors of the October paper stress that coaches and players need more education about the possible hazards for carriers of the sick-cell trait.

Experts who study cystic fibrosis, which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, also want more attention on the health complications that carriers can experience. As many as one in 25 Americans of European descent is a carrier for cystic fibrosis, but many are not aware of their status. For this disease, reports of symptoms in carriers go back at least several decades. Take, for example, infertility. Almost all men who have two mutated copies of the CFTR gene lack vas deferens, and without these tubes, sperm have no path out of the testes. In the mid-’90s, scientists found a handful of cystic-fibrosis carriers who lacked vas deferens, despite only one of their CFTR copies being mutated.

Carriers of cystic fibrosis can face other real health issues—dramatic sinus problems requiring multiple surgeries, pancreatitis, and possibly pancreatic cancer, which researchers have documented in papers over the past several years. “We’ve always said being a carrier of a single cystic-fibrosis mutation doesn’t usually lead to health issues. And usually it doesn’t,” Michael Boyle, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, told me. “However, we do know, and probably have a greater appreciation than ever, that being a carrier can lead to health issues for some.” There are about 10 million cystic-fibrosis carriers in the United States alone, so if even a fraction of them have some degree of symptoms, that amounts to many people with manifestations of the disease.

Questions about carriers’ health problems go beyond well-known diseases such as sickle cell and cystic fibrosis. Consider xeroderma pigmentosum: People with two mutated gene copies are up to 2,000 times more likely to develop melanoma than the average person; a 2023 analysis found strong evidence that some carriers of the disease were also more likely to develop skin cancer. Up to 3 percent of carriers of hereditary hemochromatosis show symptoms such as iron overload in their organs. Carriers of Gaucher disease Type 1 are at increased risk of Parkinson’s. Carriers of LIG4 syndrome experience a version of the immunodeficiency that, in the fully expressed syndrome, causes life-threatening illness.

For many of these diseases, having two mutated copies of the related gene generally means that the disease will come for you. Having one copy can still mean nothing: Plenty of carriers of recessive genetic diseases seem none the worse for it. An estimated one in 20 people is, like Sid, a carrier for thalassemia, but not all people with a copy of the mutation experience anemia and fainting like he did. Why some carriers of genetic illnesses might be affected and others remain free from symptoms is not clear. But “people who are thought to be just carriers but show some symptoms of that disease may sometimes have a second hard-to-discover mutation,” Edward Neilan, the chief medical and scientific officer of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, told me. “They may actually have two mutations.”

Being a carrier can have benefits. One theory of why genetic diseases spread widely is that having one copy of a mutated gene has some advantage. It’s well understood, for example, that being a carrier for sickle-cell disease offers some protection against malaria. And some have theorized that being a carrier for cystic fibrosis can defend against severe cholera, although the evidence for this theory is more scant. A 2023 analysis discovered that although two variant copies of the SCN5A gene elevates a person’s risk of severe heart-rhythm problems, just one copy actually might lower a person’s risk of heart-rhythm irregularities compared with the general population.

Even when being a carrier of a particular disease isn’t itself beneficial, knowing that you are a carrier can be. Carriers of certain variants of xeroderma pigmentosum, for example, might want to go to extra lengths to avoid excessive sun exposure; some carriers of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, who appear to have a heightened risk of lung issues, might decide not to smoke. And people with the sickle-cell trait might be well-advised to acclimatize before doing sports at high altitudes.

Knowing you’re a carrier for cystic fibrosis might help guide your family-planning decisions, for instance. (Even without vas deferens, a person could still become a father using sperm extraction and in vitro fertilization—which some carriers of cystic fibrosis opt for anyway, to avoid passing on the disease.) But there are limits: The science is still out on whether Trikafta, a relatively new medication that has transformed the disease for many people, would help with sinus or pancreatic issues in carriers. The medication isn’t approved for carriers, either.

For Sid, knowing that he had a thalassemia mutation—which can cause dizziness—has made him feel less bad about his difficulty with intensive physical training, for example. And he is comforted to know what likely caused his high-school fainting episode. Finding out about the mutation in his genome gave him a fuller picture of his health. “Personally,” he said, “that’s kind of how I saw it—this kind of gave me some more understanding.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Sally Jenkins, a staff writer who has reported on the man who broke physics, athletes who keep competing into their 40s, and how to fix the mess of college sports.

Sally was pleasantly surprised by the lighthearted tone of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. She also recommends listening to Joni Mitchell’s 2000 version of “Both Sides Now,” visiting the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, and watching I’m Not There for its mosaic-like quality.

The television show I’m most enjoying right now: There is a Hollywood story in David Niven’s autobiography Bring on the Empty Horses, in which the screenwriter Charles MacArthur asks Charlie Chaplin how to make the comic pratfall scene of a person slipping on a banana peel new again. Chaplin suggests that MacArthur start with a lady walking down the street and cut to a shot of the banana peel on the sidewalk, which the lady steps over—right before she falls down a manhole.

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms embodies this precept of good screenwriting. The prequel series illustrates a reversal to innocence after the relentless ruthlessness of Game of Thrones; it’s a great example of how to capture viewers who probably thought nothing more could surprise them.

The upcoming entertainment event I’m most looking forward to: Whatever the next season of The Diplomat brings. Smartest-written show in a long time. Also Project Hail Mary, just because there are no bad space movies, just like there are no bad heist movies. [Related: A splashy drama about the diplomacy of marriage]

An actor I would watch in anything: Meryl Streep, of course. There is something athletic about Streep’s acting, not physically, but in her refusal to ever give less than her absolute all.

My favorite blockbuster and favorite art movie: Aliens for blockbuster, because it ushered in the female action hero. Without Sigourney Weaver spraying fire, there would be no Uma Thurman in Kill Bill or Charlize Theron as the Imperator Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road.

For an art movie, Tár. Does that qualify? If not, then I’m Not There, which I saw about seven times. I loved the mosaic-ness of it.

Best novel I’ve recently read, and the best work of nonfiction: Best novel is Ian McEwan’s What We Can Know. He lures you into a physical and psychological world that is entirely believable even though you know it’s total fiction—one that manages to feel prescient and ancient at the same time. To make you believe the most improbable things, he has to credibly write from the character’s psychology, and that’s so much harder than, say, plot. [Related: The best books of 2025]

As for nonfiction, Sidney Blumenthal’s multivolume biography of Abraham Lincoln. Really underrated; you think you’ve heard everything about Lincoln, and yet Blumenthal comes up with all kinds of small facts about him borne by pure dogged research and an eye for detail.

A poem that I return to: Gerard Manley Hopkins’s “God’s Grandeur.” For the groundbreaking rhythm of the poem (“Generations have trod, have trod, have trod”) and the imagery of the sun flaming over the world “like shining from shook foil.”

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: Joni Mitchell’s rerecorded orchestral, smoky-breathed, and whiskeyed version of “Both Sides Now,” which is a perfect bracket. The first version is about growing up, and the second is about growing old, with an unmatched poignancy. For a loud song, without question: “Mr. Brightside,” by the Killers, which has somehow become a sports-stadium anthem; there’s nothing like 80,000 middle-aged men all singing with the loudspeakers, “Now I’m falling asleep, and she’s calling a cab …”

The last thing that made me cry: I can’t remember the last one, only the most powerful one: the original production of Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia on the London stage with Felicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, and Rufus Sewell. Sat shuddering in my seat as the lights drew down.

The last thing that made me snort with laughter: The ludicrous perfection of the hockey bodies on Heated Rivalry.

A sculpture that I cherish: This will sound so obvious, but Michelangelo’s David. It’s the single best portrayal of an athlete I’ve ever seen, if you observe it from that perspective as opposed to an artistic one or a biblical one. Look at the dangling hand. Look at the stance. Look at the looseness, the pre-coil of the body. He’s getting ready to throw the heat.

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art’s Anselm Kiefer installation, which includes Women of the Revolution, his haunting sea-battle pieces, and Die Schechina (Sefiroth), the glass-encased plaster wedding dress cut with shards. I’d never seen a Kiefer piece until three years ago. My birthday happens to be at the peak of fall season, so I made a trip to Massachusetts to see the colors change. My friends took me to MASS MoCA—and it was the best gift anyone ever gave me.

Something I recently reread: I periodically revisit To Kill a Mockingbird to remind myself how to build mood and apprehension. Sportswriting is often about trying to make the reader feel a sense of anticipation even if they already know the final score. Harper Lee does something remarkable in the opening of her book: Even though the reader knows that this story about children will likely turn out okay for them in the end, Lee seeds dread in the first sentence, making you want to know how it’s all going to happen. “When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.” First of all, got his arm badly broken! Somebody did it to him; he didn’t fall from a tree. Second, “at the elbow” is an automatic flinch for the reader. It’s a master class, that sentence—a cloud passes right across the sun. And she maintains that tension throughout the book.

A piece of journalism that recently changed my perspective on a topic: Anything by Nellie Bowles in her Friday column for The Free Press. I don’t always agree, but I usually come away saying, “I hadn’t really thought of that,” and laughing like hell while I do.

A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: Isn’t William Langewiesche on the Malaysia ghost flight the best piece of modern magazine writing ever?

Something delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life: Not ashamed to say, Taylor Swift. My goddaughter would come over, and it was Radio Free Taylor in our house: all Taylor, all the time. Slowly but surely, the lyrics worked on me, and I realized I was listening to a hell of a writer. I later took great pride in introducing my goddaughter to a Swift song she hadn’t heard: “Renegade,” a collaboration with Big Red Machine. “Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?” Bang.

The Multibillion-Dollar Foundation That Controls the Humanities

In 1964, an influential report identified a disquieting trend in academia. “Increasingly during the past few years,” it began, “concern has been expressed about the condition, in this country, of those fields of intellectual activity generally called the humanities.” The 200-plus-page document was a publication of the National Commission on the Humanities, which had been established the previous year.

Reading the commission’s findings six decades later, one could reasonably conclude that what today gets called the “crisis of the humanities” is not so much a discrete 21st-century emergency as the latest expression of an educational catastrophe long in the making. The challenges outlined in 1964 are familiar: meager funding, insufficient support for graduate students, too few faculty jobs, an education system that glamorizes science and math, dense writing that alienates the public, and on and on. “The state of the humanities today creates a crisis,” the report concluded. “There is genuine doubt today whether the universities and colleges can insure that the purposes for which they were established and sometimes endowed will be fulfilled.”

At the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, competing short-track racers crashed into one another at the finish line.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The coffee corner at Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich is so mobbed with diplomats and executives exchanging business cards and guzzling caffeine that it’s easy to miss even the most recognizable faces. And Jens-Frederik Nielsen is not one of those.

Still, the baby-faced prime minister of Greenland was surrounded by throngs of people looking to shake his hand, pass him their card, or take a selfie with him at the annual Munich Security Conference, the first major get-together of European defense and security officials since his country became the center of a geopolitical melee. Nielsen, who is 34 years old, assumed office less than a year ago but has spent much of his term facing an assault on Greenland’s sovereignty by President Trump, who wants to acquire or annex the autonomous Danish territory—whether its citizens want it or not.

Over the thrumming of cappuccino machines and the clinking of coffee mugs, Nielsen told me he was having none of it. “That’s a red line,” he said. “We will not give away territory and compromise our integrity.”

Greenland has been the unlikely belle of the Munich ball as U.S., European, NATO, and other leaders try to hash out just how serious Trump’s threats are. Trump says he has ruled out taking Greenland by force. But given that he also earlier this year ordered a military raid, without Congressional approval, on Venezuela to remove its president, no one here views the crisis as over, especially not Nielsen. As I spoke with the prime minister, the White House released a series of satirical Valentine’s Day cards—among them, one with the map of Greenland inside a heart. The caption reads: “It’s time we define our situationship.”

Nielsen, with Scandinavian restraint, acknowledged that his country has faced “tense periods” of late. It will almost certainly face more soon. White House officials tell me the president remains fixated on Greenland and is unlikely to back down, even though there are now high-level talks underway about boosting the U.S. military presence there. At this month’s annual black-tie dinner at the Alfalfa Club (a Washington, D.C. society for muckety-mucks from politics and business), attendees told me that President Trump, in private conversations, reinforced his desire to “buy” Greenland, not invade it. (The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)

When I shared that with Nielsen, he looked frustrated, but not surprised. “That is not acceptable,” he said. “We will not give it away. But in terms of more military personnel, and in terms of more cooperation and so on, let’s talk. Let’s have a conversation about it. We can figure things out.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who headlined the conference today, didn’t mention Greenland or the Arctic in his keynote speech. He didn’t mention China or Russia by name, either, though Trump has claimed that their intrusion into the Arctic underpins his desire for Greenland. Instead, Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone than allies have grown used to. At last year’s conference, Vice President J. D. Vance was met with stony silence after he suggested the “greatest threat looming over Europe comes not from China or Russia” but rather the “internal threat” within the continent. The Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies toward its European allies since then have largely echoed that sentiment.

Rubio drew applause from the crowd when he declared that the U.S. “will always be a child of Europe.” Still, he stressed the need to revitalize the alliance. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” he said, describing the decline as a “conscious policy choice.”

Read: Does America really want to pick a fight with Greenland?

Revitalization, to the Trump administration, hinges on American dominance in the Western Hemisphere—which includes Greenland despite its historic ties to Europe. Trump’s description of the dynamic blends the lingo of real-estate advice with the imperatives of national security. “You defend ownership, you don’t defend leases,” he told reporters at the White House last month.

Nielsen, who worked as a real-estate agent before entering politics in 2020, sees it differently. “It’s a matter of international law and sovereignty,” he told me. The son of a Danish father and a Greenlandic mother (and, as it happens, a national badminton champion), he talks of deep nationalism and pride that cannot be bought, but stressed that his citizens are open to cooperation.

Since Trump first expressed interest in Greenland in 2019, the country of 55,000 has seen throngs of companies looking to invest in the island’s abundant natural resources, which Nielsen welcomes as long as the approaches are coordinated with his government. Tourism has spiked. Once an economy that relied heavily on fishing, Greenland has embraced its unanticipated turn in the geopolitical spotlight by building infrastructure, including a new airport, which opened in the capital, Nuuk, in 2024. A bigger diplomatic presence also has arrived: The U.S. opened a consulate in Nuuk in 2020, its first since 1953; the European Union, Canada, and France have opened consulates since, the latter two in response to Trump’s renewed threats. Nielsen said he welcomes it all and more but added, “We want cooperation with mutual respect.”

Trump backed down, for now, on his threat to forcibly annex the country in large part because of how poorly his plans were received domestically. A new AP/NORC poll this week found that about seven in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland. That included about half of Republicans polled.

Nielsen has never met Trump, nor has he spoken with him, though Nielsen met yesterday with Rubio for a conversation that Nielsen described as “constructive.” Most of the discussions about Greenland’s sovereignty, Nielsen told me, have been conducted either through direct talks with the Danish government or through NATO—a process he believes is more productive. He repeatedly emphasized the progress being made by the working group formed after the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington last month with Vance and Rubio.

Nielsen worries about Greenland’s future being defined by anyone other than Greenland and Denmark, including by well-intentioned allies. But he was keen to offer an olive branch to Trump. “We are willing to talk also about the concerns he has about security,” Nielsen said. “We want to talk.” And with that, he turned to the next in line.</div>

I got the DVDs thinking they&#39;d be better quality. I was disappointed that my PAL VHS copies were the best quality until the latest transfer Amazon streamed.

The original was shot on Super35 film, with framing for 4:3 and 16:9, but the CGI was only rendered for 4:3 (and 480i), since even that was pushing the technology available in the day. The belief was that eventually the CGI could be re-rendered at 16:9 (and potentially higher resolution), but then Warner Brothers lost the files and the composite scene source elements. So for the 16:9 transfer, live-action only scenes were re-framed (as originally intended so look okay),

No. The new transfer done by HBO (and also released on Blu-Ray) two years ago is good quality - the film has been rescanned. The CGI sequences that were pre-rendered in NTSC (480p, 30 fps) have been upscaled. The film transfers are probably intentionally soft to make it clash less with the upscaled CGI sequences.

Note that the Gathering (Pilot) and other TV movies (Thirdspace, In The Beginning, Call to Arms, etc) as well as the sequel series Crusade have *not* been updated.

There&#39;s a lot to that. A bunch of SV bros accustomed to moving fast and breaking things is the last thing you want handling things that kill people when they break.

When you damage functional DNA, the most common result is death rather than spider powers or hulk.

I think of DNA as instructions on how to do things and if you change the instructions for most things, it just dies.

Heart, lung, intenstines, veins, pancrease, etc.  all matter a lot.   Not to mention forgetting how to make bones, muscles, tendons, etc.

Yes, there is a 1 in a 100 case where you get a slow, drawn out death.  And a 1 in a 1,000 where the change is minor enough to simply weaken you.  And of course

It might be interesting the fertility rates. Many mutations go un-noticed because the embryo fails early and just goes away. The potential mother just thinks she was a couple weeks late for some reason.

A lot of the non coding DNA is for controlling copying and some we just don&#39;t know what it does. Sure some might be ancient viral but that doesn&#39;t mean its all useless and mutations will have no effect.

1994 I was downloading one of the earlier versions of Slackware over my SLIP dialup on a 28.8k. Downloaded the packages over FTP. This was 1.x versions. Man that was lifetime ago. I also remember transitioning the libraries from a.out to ELF. At some point I got my hands on a CD-ROM for Redhat Linux 2.2 Beta I want to say. It wasn&#39;t an official release and isn&#39;t listed anywhere as such that I can find today, but I swear it existed.

Can a cesspool of the vanities become a black hole? Just asking for a friend (who hasn&#39;t retired yet).

The vanity in this particular case is thinking you are so valuable that the phishers would want to hire you. But I kind of like the recursive nature of breaching you so they can go after your references and contacts, too.

Did I FP? I confess that possibility was a factor in not writing at my usual length, but now I&#39;m thinking of two examples for your consideration:

(1) LinkedIn as the home of fake recruiters harvesting personal information.

(2) YouTube as the source of the best AI-powered phishing scam I&#39;ve seen yet. My theory of the case is that they went after people who had commented on a famous author&#39;s videos on YouTube. The email seemed to come from the author and seemed to be related to one of the projects he&#39;d describe

I think more about being alert to obviously suspicious signs, usually these malicious fake companies make a bunch of errors you should be catching. But if you&#39;re desperate, you&#39;re not at your best. You&#39;re more likely to miss things.

Sure, it&#39;s weird, but nature doesn&#39;t owe us anything.

The article here is using redshift to infer the age of the universe when light from these galaxies was emitted and complex models involving star formation, stellar composition, etc. to estimate the age of the galaxies themselves.  It&#39;s more likely something is off with the galaxy age estimate or our understanding of how early galaxies formed than Lambda-CDM as a whole being wrong.  These are recent observations only enabled by the Webb telescope.  They&#39;ll figure it out.

My favorite answer is that the &quot;big bang&quot; is not unique.  They don&#39;t occur often, but they do occur repeatedly.  Possibly whenever the amount of matter within a light cone gets too sparse.  So there would be *some* old pieces left around.

N.B.:  Calling this a speculative model is giving it too much credit.  It&#39;s just a Wild Ass Guess.  But I don&#39;t know enough to convince myself that it&#39;s wrong.

that sounds similar to the traditional steady-state model. personally i would love for lambdaCDM to lose out to steady-state, but i think there is some inconvenient evidence against it.

1. Our models on galaxy formation are wrong.

2. Our universe sprang a leak into another.

Can they measure the percent of heavy elements in the spectrum of such galaxies. More heavies are associated with later-generation stars.

Thank you! Vim and Emacs are the main reason I have to reboot my computer. Impossible to exit!

True, I just hit ctrl-F2 to get another shell and kill the vim process like everybody else does. I used to login through ssh from another computer to kill the vim process before I learned about ctrl-F2 from my Unix mentor.

To be sure use:esc :qor sometimes:esc :q!

You&#39;ve summed up how my journey to learn Unix and Linux began. In the early days of the internet we used SLIP or PPP connections, and usually that came with a shell account (typically some BSD variant). I was a young tech working primarily on DOS, Windows 3.1, and OS/2. I started playing around with that shell account. I tried to figure out how to display the contents of a text file. I figured out many *mix commands were two letters, and eventually typed &quot;vi&quot; and pressed enter. I had to call my ISP tech sup

Displaying the contents of a text file was/is relatively easy: just type

$ cat foo.bar

and you&#39;d get the contents of the file.  If you wanted to edit it, though, your 2 options were ed and vi.  The former was a line editor, so one couldn&#39;t do much, unless the file in question had just a line.  Vi was the other option, and it was a pain to use, unless one knew all the commands

If somebody has X or Wayland and a DE on top of it, why would s/he want to use vim?  Why not just use one of the editors that come w/ the DE?  Hopefully, the DE devs leave that utility alone, whatever else they do w/ the rest of the project

Even if X or Wayland weren&#39;t there, I&#39;d rather use something like nano - hope it comes as a part of the default installation, than vim

Other thing I&#39;m wondering - are they competing w/ Notepad and Notepad++ to make it equally vulnerable?

If somebody has X or Wayland and a DE on top of it, why would s/he want to use vim?  Why not just use one of the editors that come w/ the DE?Because vim has super-powerful features for development. I still prefer it to any IDE I&#39;ve ever used over the past 30 years. (Although I will say that VS Code is better for read-only browsing of large code bases. Other than that use, I find its behavior to be infuriating, and its &quot;vim mode&quot; is crap.)vim is also superior to nano-type editors for any nontrivial editing of non-code files, with macros and powerful commands that can reorganize thousands of lines instantly. Notepad++ is also OK for that work, but

Because it works and, in my case, I know how to use it.

I use vim for many things, from editing configuration files to writing detective stories.

And https://github.com/vimwiki/vim... [github.com] is a great way to keep organized notes.

If you really know that you&#39;ll never use vim (remember that crontab uses vim as the default editor, for example) then you can create a script with one word in it, &quot;exit&quot; should work, or &quot;true&quot;, then set it as executable and put it into your ~/bin directory.

Then when you type &quot;vim&quot; nothing will happen, assuming that ~/bin is further up on your path than the /usr/bin.

I&#39;m still using whatever version of vim came with my initial distro install since as far as basic text editing goes it&#39;s been feature complete for decades. I&#39;m sure some people like writing vim scripts to do... drawing a blank frankly.... but only once in my 30 year career have I met someone who did and that was just to do some company specific search and replacing.

This reminds me of the mid-1990s, when vi / vim was the best editor around. (Or was it emacs???) Anyway, I used to write down on a sticky note, command sequences I was trying to memorize, and stick it to the wall next to my desk. When I got one command sequence down, I&#39;d pick another one, so I didn&#39;t have to keep looking at man pages. For years, vim was one of very few editors that could do regex search and replace, and that alone kept me using it for a long time. But these days, most decent editors, like Notepad++, can do pretty much everything vim could do, so I finally quit installing it. AND I don&#39;t have to write down command sequences on sticky notes any more, because there is, you know, a GUI.

Yeah, that GUi will be useful on an ssh connection.

In the GUI world, we have Remote Desktop.

I suppose it depends on how you define &quot;decent.&quot; If decent means, &quot;servers with no GUI&quot; then of course you are right.

In the GUI world, we have Remote Desktop.You&#39;re assuming the server is installed and the port open; neither of which may be true.

You&#39;re assuming the server is installed and the port open; neither of which may be true.

Yes but x11 is racist or something so the lizard people are pushing real hard to replace it with wayland which does not do forwarding to a remote over ssh.

X11 app forwarding over ssh works just as well when using modern Wayland desktop as it always did, thanks to Xwayland which isn&#39;t going away. I use it very frequently.  In fact Xwayland is a full X server implementation based on x.org. It runs transparently and automatically on the major desktop environments such as Gnome and KDE.  And it will continue to work as long as the applications you run and the toolkits they are built with continue to have an X11 backend.

For Qt this is likely to be the case nearly

&quot;I use it very frequently. In fact Xwayland is a full X server implementation based on x.org&quot;

Yeah, bcos there are TCP ports dedicated to x11, namely ports 6000-6063.  But w/ all the DEs moving to Wayland, that would no longer be an option, since this new architecture requires using Remote Desktop if one wants to create a secure connection

No one has used TCP/IP ports to forward X for decades now.  X.org doesn&#39;t even listen on those ports anymore.  It&#39;s all done with unix sockets and shared memory now because of things like OpenGL.  It&#39;s also because of the needs of modern apps and hardware acceleration that 99% of X11 isn&#39;t even used anymore and modern GTK or Qt apps use X11 more like how rdp works, pushing bitmaps across (client-side rendering).

As for what Wayland apparently forces you to do, I am not sure if you&#39;re simply misinformed or ly

Yeah, that GUi will be useful on an ssh connection.I access my VNC GUI through a ssh connection, option:  -L5901:127.0.0.1:5901

Now try that in a on-demand docker container running on a restricted EC2 instance.

Yes with the NppVim plugin installed, Notepad++ can pretty much do everything vim can do.

Yes GUIs are quite useful, even for editors. gVim has a very nice one that does a good job of exposing features through the GUI without removing the power of the vim&#39;s command mode.

Fortunately all the good editors out there have plugins or bindings available to implement vim keyboard bindings, at least enough of it to be fast and comfortable. In fact I just recently learned about the VibreOffice plugin for LibreOffice,

From what I read on NppVim&#39;s GitHub page, and it looks like it mainly lets you pretend you are in Vim while in NPP. In other words, use Vim-style keystroke commands. This misses the point of using a GUI editor. Sure, you can make it react to all those keystrokes you memorized while learning to use Vim, but native NPP is capable of doing pretty much all of the actual editing *tasks* that Vim could do, but without having to memorize keystrokes. Oh, sure, there are probably some things NppVim adds that are act

I think you miss the point of having vim key bindings. To me an editor is unusable without them, or at least a lot less usable.  Obviously I can get by with a &quot;normal&quot; editor, but it really hurts my efficiency.  Even something as simple as yanking or replacing a word (or words) is painful in a conventional editor compared to the speed and ease with which I can do it with vim-like commands.  (You want me to shift arrow key and highlight like an animal when a couple of keystrokes can do it?) And the ability t

But mostly my comment about NppVim was tongue in cheek since my position is an editor without vim key bindings cannot do what vim can do!

The one reason nano is so much easier to use is that one can use cursor keys instead of having to memorize random keys to move the cursor.  Aside from that, even for programmers, I don&#39;t get vim: the one time I had to use a programming editor, I used something called crisp, which would allow one to highlight and select an entire column in a file to manipulate text - that too using a combination of menu commands and cursor keys (DOS had an equivalent editor called Brief, from Borland)

vi/nvi/vim have used the cursor keys to move the cursor for decades now.  I find nano/pico annoying.  vim gets the job done, locally and over ssh connections.

vim has always used cursor keys as long as I&#39;ve used it (at least 30 years), unless something was really messed up with the terminal settings.

I find programming without vim key bindings frustrating.  The basics are what I use the most. change word(s), replace character, yank line(s), delete line(s), paste before, paste after, insert, append, indent block.  Even something like append is so powerful.  And the best part is the repeat command turns what you just did into a mini macro.  So it&#39;s really fast to do

find . -type f -exec grep foo {} /dev/null \;

Took me awhile to be able to remember that and even aliased it for awhile. Now it is like my right hand.

It&#39;s incredible, to me, that Vim is still under any sort of development. I would not have thought that it would need anything further.

But new features? That indeed also wonders me.

I don&#39;t know about 9, but a relatively recent (in terms of vi(m)&#39;s age) would be async connections to external subprocesses. This allows things like the LSP integration which allows things like ALE plugin which gives realtime linter feedback in the editor. Like syntax highlighting but much deeper.

That indeed also wonders me.Wow, I haven&#39;t heard that grammatical construction for ages; Pennsylvania Dutch dialect.Either you&#39;ve spent a lot of time in central Pennsylvania, or you speak a language that use German grammatical rules.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

It is one thing for a state to say that it is dedicated to doing justice in capital cases. It is quite another for them to turn those commitments into action.

All too frequently, in those cases, words don’t govern actions. We say we are in favor of equal treatment but stand by while race shapes the fates of those accused of capital crimes. We say that we will not punish cruelly, but use methods of execution that impose unnecessary suffering on those we execute.

Earlier this month, Charles Flores filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court offering it the chance to change that by saying that Texas has to fulfill promises it has made to death row inmates. In his case, he wants to take advantage of a law that allows death row inmates to prove they were falsely convicted and are actually innocent.

The court should hear his case and require the Lone Star State to follow its own laws.

Charles Flores was convicted of the January 1998 killing of Betty Black during an attempted robbery. Right from the start, he has maintained his innocence.

His co-defendant, Richard Childs, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was released on parole in 2016.

One of the witnesses who helped convict Flores was Jill Barganier, Betty Black’s neighbor, who insisted at Flores’ trial that she was 100 percent sure she had seen him enter Black’s house the morning she was killed. Her testimony proved to be decisive in securing his conviction since there was no physical evidence tying Flores to the murder.

We know that eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable. In addition, the neighbor’s testimony was tainted in several ways.

First, on the day of the crime, she told police that two white men with long hair and similar builds got out of a car, a purple and pink Volkswagen Bug, and entered Black’s garage. She then picked a white male with long hair out as the driver she had seen.

But Flores looks nothing like that man. He is Hispanic, not white, and at the time that Black died, he had shaved hair and was overweight.

Bargainer also helped a police artist create a composite sketch of the men whom she saw enter Black’s house. It looked nothing like Flores.

To top it all off, she did not pick a picture of Flores out of an array of photos. So how could she go from all that to being sure Flores was involved in Black‘s killing?

She was helped along by what is called “investigative hypnosis.” A 1979 article published in the journal Detective describes it as a technique used to “obtain vital information that may have been forgotten.” Even then, though, the publication cautioned that “all leads developed through hypnosis should be verified with supporting physical or testimonial evidence … and investigative conclusion should not be based solely on hypnotically obtained information.”

Since that article was published, investigative hypnosis has been shown to be completely unreliable. “Instead of improving memory,” the Christian Science Monitor notes, “hypnosis may only manipulate it.”

That seems to have been the case with Barganier. During her hypnosis, the police asked her if one of the men she had seen had short, shaved hair.

During the hypnosis session, Barganier again described the man she saw driving the car as having “long, wavy” dark-blond hair. The hypnotist then asked her about the passenger and urged her to focus on his hair. She said it was “a lot like his friend’s,” and clarified: “dark, long.”

“Just relax,” the hypnotist said, “take a deep breath, take the time you need. Can you tell me how long his hair is? Does he have it neatly cut, or is it trimmed?”

That is a classic example of a suggestive question.

Even without such overt leading of a witness, courts in many places, including Florida, one of America’s leading death penalty states, have questioned “the reliability of statements procured by way of hypnosis.” A California court explained the danger of investigative hypnosis this way. Someone subject to hypnosis “will lose his critical judgment and begin to credit ‘memories’ that were formerly viewed as unreliable … will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable to distinguish between the two, and … will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection.”

In 2023, Texas recognized that such defects were present in investigative hypnosis. It joined a “majority of jurisdictions, which ban post-hypnotic testimony.”

The Texas criminal code now says that a statement made during or after investigative hypnosis “is not admissible against a defendant in a criminal trial, whether offered in the guilt or innocence phase or the punishment phase of the trial, if the hypnotic session giving rise to the statement was performed by a law enforcement agency to investigate the offense that is the subject of the trial.”

But it was not made to apply to cases in which someone had already been convicted at the time was passed. That in itself should raise red flags.

A state decides that a kind of evidence is so unreliable that it should not be used in any criminal case, but is willing to see someone put to death when that kind of evidence was used to convict him. What kind of justice is that?

Crucially, the issue facing the Supreme Court is whether Texas is obliged to revisit this case. Texas has passed laws specifically designed to protect innocent people from wrongful execution. They allow prisoners to return to court by filing a writ of habeas corpus and present evidence of their innocence.

It also has a law on the books allowing courts to use a lower standard of proof in cases involving junk science.

Flores wants to take advantage of those laws. As he points out in his petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, he has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow him the chance to prove that he is in fact innocent of the crime for which Texas seeks to execute him.

But,” he contends, “the TCCA has repeatedly and arbitrarily barred these efforts without explanation.” By doing so, the court is, in essence, nullifying state law and depriving him of “the state-created liberty interest upon which he seeks to rely.”

“Due process,” his petition observes, “demands more than unexplained summary dismissal in response to a substantial threshold showing of actual innocence. This case and the question it presents are exceptionally important: whether a state law enacted to safeguard against executing the innocent, when rendered illusory in practice, offends the federal right to due process.”

“Once a right is established through state law,” Flores argues, “a deprivation of the right implicates federal procedural due process protection.”

He accuses the state of “gratuitously barring credibly innocent prisoners on death row from proving their innocence. This Court,” he adds, “should grant certiorari to clarify that the constitutional guarantee of due process prohibits state courts employing arbitrary or irrational procedures to foreclose even making the case of innocence.”

More than 50 years ago, the Supreme Court recognized what it called “statutory entitlements.” As Justice William Brennan put it, when the state creates a right for a class of individuals, it may not deny an individual seeking to exercise that right without “procedural due process.”

Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “’The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.’”

That is all Charles Flores is asking for, an “opportunity to be heard” on a life-and-death matter. If the Supreme Court does not give him that chance, it will add to the long list of instances when the law promises one thing but doesn’t deliver it to death row inmates.

Is Justice Samuel Alito getting ready to call it quits? A flurry of recent hints has prompted new speculation that the Supreme Court’s most reliably partisan conservative is eyeing the exits in advance of the 2026 midterms. On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern sift through the clues, politics, and legacy management that may be driving Alito toward retirement. They also game out whom President Donald Trump might pick—among the many MAGA judges already campaigning for the seat—as the justice’s possible successor. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Our friend Elie Mystal wrote a great piece in the Nation saying he thinks Alito is going to step down. Our friends at Strict Scrutiny have also suggested as much. Mark, what’s your gossipy buzz telling you?

Mark Joseph Stern: I agree. And the first reason is the announcement of the justice’s forthcoming memoir, which is pompously titled So Ordered: An Originalist’s View of the Constitution, the Court, and Our Country. Of course, justices do publish books on the bench. But there are some indications that this particular release will be a farewell postscript for Alito’s service. First, it’s coming out on Oct. 6, which is one day after the Supreme Court’s next term begins. As Elie noted, it is unusual for the justices to publish books in October because they like to promote their books, and they can’t do that when they’re stuck in D.C., hearing oral arguments. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett all published recent books in early September—timing that makes sense because that’s when the public is starting to pay attention again. The new term is gearing up, but the justices are not stuck in Washington. They are still free to fly around the country, plugging their latest release. I think it’s pretty unlikely that Alito would drop his memoir on a date when he specifically cannot do that.

Second, Alito just celebrated the 20th anniversary of his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Conservative lawyers and pundits marked the occasion by publishing laudatory articles that had, to me, a distinctly valedictory feel to them. That includes at least one former clerk who may well be in contact with the justice and even have an inkling of his plans. On top of that, Alito gave this rare interview to Politico, which surprised me given that it was Politico that published the leak of his Dobbs draft opinion. So you’d think he might have a grudge. Anyway, in that interview, he seemed to look back over his service and view Dobbs as his finest achievement, almost like the capstone of his tenure. He also hinted that he was not really enjoying the job or the coarse civic culture of our current moment.

Finally, there’s another book coming out, this one by Mollie Hemingway, a MAGA pseudo-journalist, called Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution. It’s going to be this obsequious, bootlicking celebration of Alito’s brilliance. The publisher’s description calls it “the authoritative—and explosive—inside story of Justice Samuel Alito and his powerful role in shaping the Supreme Court.” It seems highly probable that Alito gave interviews to Hemingway, even if it was on background. It feels to me as if he is trying to secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media, which is what matters most to him. And I think that the main reason he would be doing that is because he’s ready to step down and pass the torch.

I was struck by the fact that in the Politico interview, Alito said he wished Justice Antonin Scalia were around to take a victory lap, because the court has achieved so much of what he worked toward and is now finally on the right track. It’s so sad he’s missing it. Within a paragraph, Alito then suggested that Scalia would have been “appalled” by the ugliness, the coarseness of the discourse. Well, who was single-handedly responsible for coarsening the discourse at the Supreme Court for a very long time? Why, it was Scalia! He’d be loving the discourse right now. He built it.

I also think this love story about originalism from Alito feels a little cynical. You and I have spent a lot of time discussing whether Alito really is an originalist or if whether is perfectly result-oriented and completely political. Either way, I guess the better question isn’t what Alito calls himself but what he does. If he does step down soon, won’t it probably be because he wants Trump to replace him while Republicans hold the Senate?

Alito is not an originalist. In fact, he’s made fun of originalism before. His jurisprudence is completely aligned with the Republican Party platform. He watches Fox News. I’m sure he reads the polls. He must know there is a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall—which, of course, means that he would be stuck on the bench for at least two more years, maybe six more years, maybe even longer.

And we know that his wife, Martha-Ann, has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire so she can fly whatever flag she wants to.

Martha-Ann definitely wants him to step down. And Alito saw how Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a bad bet and wound up getting replaced by a successor who is torching her legacy. He doesn’t want that to happen. He is savvy enough to know that stepping down before the midterms means that Trump can replace him with someone who is just as conservative, if not more so. Republicans have a comfortable margin in the Senate. Retiring now could cement his jurisprudence for years to come with a mini-Alito who is 30 years younger. That’s probably what is guiding his decision more so than anything else. But in fairness, when we give justices life tenure, we empower them to make these kinds of partisan decisions. You can hate the game, but you can’t really hate the player.

Who do you think could potentially inherit the mantle of the man who gave us witchburners as the reason to overturn Roe v. Wade?

I will throw out two names: Emil Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, and Andy Oldham, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. I flag Bove because he has already proved his absolute fealty to Trump—first as his personal lawyer, then at the Justice Department, when he struck the corrupt bargain to drop criminal charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, defied court orders barring the illegal deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and reportedly helped kill the investigation into Tom Homan’s alleged acceptance of a bribe. We know that Trump was disappointed in his first three picks because he felt as if they weren’t sufficiently loyal to him. With Bove, he wouldn’t have to worry about that.

At the same time, I can imagine that the White House might not want to reopen Bove’s scandals or give Democrats an opportunity to probe them. He’s already gotten his reward with a lifetime seat on the 3rd Circuit. So, to my mind, Oldham is the more likely candidate. He’s a former Alito clerk and a MAGA fanatic who has gone very far out of his way to campaign for this seat with a constant stream of Trump-pandering opinions. He’s even further right than Alito, who has overruled him multiple times. He also looks the part, which may seem like a shallow observation, but we know that that is important to this president. I think he has a leg up on his colleague James Ho, who has also been campaigning for the seat, because Ho will not look the part to this president. If I had to put money down, I’d say Oldham will be the pick, because he’s got the far-right jurisprudence and he looks like the MAGA justice from central casting in Donald Trump’s dreams.

I think you’re aiming way too high in selecting actual sitting judges for this. I’m going to go with Lindsey Halligan and Jeanine Pirro. I know central casting is the most important phrase for Trump when selecting someone. But I also think the “Own the Libs” vibe is such that it could be Kash Patel. You seemed to suggest that gravitas at some level is important. And I’m not sure it’s going to be.

There was a moment, when the tech CEOs and media moguls were lining up to kiss Trump’s ring, when it looked like almost all the demographic arrows were pointing right, where it looked like Trumpism was, if not widely embraced, at least too big to be written off. After a year of Trump back in office, the culture cries out for Woke 2.0.

            <div id="article-text">ai-pocalypse Legal scholars have found that OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5 follows the law better than human judges, but they leave open the question of whether AI is right for the job.

University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner and researcher Shivam Saran set out to expand upon work they published last year in a paper [PDF] titled, &quot;Judge AI: A Case Study of Large Language Models in Judicial Decision-Making.&quot;

In that study, the authors tested OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o, a state of the art model at the time, to decide a war crimes case.

They gave GPT-4o the following prompt: &quot;You are an appeals judge in a pending case at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Your task is to determine whether to affirm or reverse the lower court&#39;s decision.&quot;

They presented the model with a statement of facts, legal briefs for the prosecution defense, the applicable law, the summarized precedent, and the summarized trial judgement.

And they asked the model whether it would support the trial decision, to see how the AI responded and compare that to prior research (Spamann and Klöhn, 2016, 2024), that looked at differences in the way that judges and law students decided that test case.

Those initial studies found law students more formalistic – more likely to follow precedent – and judges more realistic – more likely to consider non-legal factors – in legal decisions.

GPT-4o was found to be more like law students based on its tendency to follow the letter of the law, without being swayed by external factors like whether the plaintiff or defendant was more sympathetic.

Posner and Saran followed up on this work in a paper titled, &quot;Silicon Formalism: Rules, Standards, and Judge AI.&quot;

This time, they used OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5 to replicate a study originally conducted with 61 US federal judges.

The legal questions in this instance were more mundane than the war crimes trial – the judges, in specific state jurisdictions, were asked to make choices about which state law would apply in a car accident scenario.

Posner and Saran put these questions to GPT-5 and the model aced the test, showing no evidence of hallucination or logical errors in its legal reasoning – problems that have plagued the use of AI in legal cases.

&quot;We find the LLM to be perfectly formalistic, applying the legally correct outcome in 100 percent of cases; this was significantly higher than judges, who followed the law a mere 52 percent of the time,&quot; they note in their paper. &quot;Like the judges, however, GPT did not favor the more sympathetic party. This aligns with our earlier paper, where GPT was mostly unmoved by legally irrelevant personal characteristics.&quot;

In their testing of GPT-5, one other model followed the law in every single instance: Google Gemini 3 Pro. Other models demonstrated lower compliance rates: Gemini 2.5 Pro (92 percent); o4-mini (79 percent); Llama 4 Maverick (75 percent); Llama 4 Scout (50 percent); and GPT-4.1 (50 percent). Judges, as noted previously, followed the law 52 percent of the time.

That doesn&#39;t mean the judges are more lawless, the authors say, because when the applicable legal doctrine is a standard or guideline as opposed to a legally enforceable rule, judges have some discretion in how they interpret the doctrine.

But as AI sees more use in legal work – despite cautionary missteps over the past few years – legal experts, lawmakers, and the public will have to decide whether the technology should move beyond a supporting role to make consequential decisions. A mock trial held last year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law suggests this is a matter of active exploration.

Both the GPT-4o and GPT-5 experiments show AI models follow the letter of the law more than human judges. But as Posner and Saran argue in their 2025 paper, &quot;the apparent weakness of human judges is actually a strength. Human judges are able to depart from rules when following them would produce bad outcomes from a moral, social, or policy standpoint.&quot;

Pointing to the perfect scores for GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro, the two legal scholars said it&#39;s clear AI models are moved toward formalism and away from discretionary human judgement.

&quot;And does that mean that LLMs are becoming better than human judges or worse?&quot; ask Posner and Saran.

Would society accept doctrinaire AI judgements that punish sympathetic defendants or reward unsympathetic ones that might go a different way if viewed through human bias? And given that AI models can be steered toward certain outcomes through parameters and training, what&#39;s the proper setting to mete out justice? ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Just picture it. You&#39;re at a Swiss train station, looking for information on your connecting line. You peer up at the platform sign hoping to find out how long you&#39;ll be waiting and whether you&#39;re standing in the right place. But instead of helpful info, you see &quot;* Installation log files are stored in /tmp.&quot; Gee, thanks a lot!

Spotted by the eagle-eyed brother of a Register reader, an IT support person based in Northern Ireland, the signage on platform 1 at Sargans appears to be a little too clever for its own good, but has – alas – fallen over when trying to boot what appears to be a variant of Linux.

It&#39;s always good to see Linux being more than capable of having a day just as bad as Windows when it comes to digital signage.

There are some helpful hints about what went wrong, and there&#39;s always an opportunity to run a text installation if a user really wants. There is, however, no option to fall back to the much-missed split-flap signs of old – sometimes called &quot;Solari&quot; boards after the Italian manufacturer Solari di Udine – or the manually updated planks that were a fixture of this writer&#39;s schooldays.

The Register asked the purveyors of wonderfully nerdy displays, UK Departure Boards, for their thoughts. After all, if it&#39;s possible to bring British train, heritage rail, bus, and tram information to a domestic display, then how hard can it be to make the same happen on a Swiss station platform?

A spokesperson for the outfit told us the company had no plans to expand to other countries, although observed: &quot;Looks like the Linux OS crashed, or became corrupted, so it can&#39;t boot correctly.&quot;

We took a look at the UK Departure Boards hardware in 2024 and concluded that the boards, while not cheap, were perfect for anyone with even the smallest interest in transport. Recent updates include support for freight and non-stop services on the software side and built-in speakers on the hardware side.

Our reader&#39;s brother was heading to Innsbruck, and we hope he was able to select the correct train without assistance from the platform board. That said, there are worse places in the world to be than Sargans. There&#39;s a castle to look at, decent hiking to be had, and some spectacular scenery. Sure, the station might be eclipsed by the UK&#39;s East Croydon in many ways. But, then again, the station also isn&#39;t in East Croydon... ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the Venn diagram of car owners whose vehicles have a certain amount of &quot;character&quot; and individuals who use Microsoft&#39;s applications, there is an intersection of people who accept a quirk or two but not an unexpected explosion.

These individuals were recently celebrated in &quot;On That Side Of Things,&quot; a spin-off of the Smith and Sniff podcast in which Jonny Smith, a former presenter of the Fifth Gear UK television show, and Richard Porter, a writer for Top Gear and The Grand Tour, discuss cars and many other things.

Smith and Porter were answering a listener&#39;s question about Microsoft products, which led Porter to express his frustration with some of the applications produced by the Windows behemoth, notably the online version of Excel, as well as Word&#39;s habit of occasionally doing unexpected things with tables and styles.

Porter complained about difficulties when trying to insert lines in Excel. (Which, to be fair to Microsoft, is relatively straightforward – need to insert a row? Right-click on a selected row. Need to insert a line in text? Alt+Return is probably going to be your friend.) But then Porter turned to that other productivity stalwart, Word.

&quot;Never underestimate Microsoft&#39;s ability to make things more complicated,&quot; he said.

&quot;It&#39;s almost like having an Alfa Romeo … you just go &#39;Oh, yeah, it always does that. I&#39;m kind of used to it now. I accept it. It&#39;s character, isn&#39;t it?&#39;

&quot;Except it&#39;s not &#39;character&#39; in a piece of software. It&#39;s just irritating.&quot;

Porter went on to give an example, &quot;My favorite thing in Word is when you go, &#39;I&#39;m just going to paste in something here, but I think we&#39;ve already established that I&#39;ve already written 3,000 words in Times New Roman 12-point. I&#39;m just going to paste this little guy in here and… OH LOOK, YOU&#39;VE CHANGED THE WHOLE F**KING THING TO WINGDINGS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s infuriating.&quot; Porter continued in a similar vein for some time (and there is likely a special slot reserved in the Bad Place for whoever came up with Word&#39;s table implementation), but his experience raises an interesting question.

If Microsoft&#39;s products were a car, what car would it be?

A classic Alfa can quickly be discounted, since the styling and driver engagement handily offset the vehicle&#39;s habit of dissolving if looked at funny, or its ability to vomit its engine and gearbox contents abruptly onto the road. A humdrum family hatchback that is dull but gets the job done with tedious competence can also be dismissed.

So what is the automotive equivalent of Microsoft&#39;s current output?

(In the interests of full disclosure, this writer is a subscriber to the podcast and thinks you should subscribe to it too. The Register, of course, has no position when it comes to motoring in social media.) ®

            <div id="article-text">Hands-on Run real Windows in an automatically managed virtual machine, and mix Windows apps in their own windows on your Linux desktop.

WinApps and WinBoat both deliver the same functionality: they run real Windows in a VM and export native Windows apps in individual windows onto your Linux desktops, integrated with your native Linux applications, via the wizardry of Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP was Microsoft&#39;s answer to X11, before the great minds of the Wayland project came along to tell us that we don&#39;t need such things.

For all the abilities of modern Linux, there are some apps – especially paid commercial ones – that still require Windows. We outlined three ways to run Windows apps on Linux in May 2025. WINE is amazing and the current version can run a lot of Windows apps smoothly on Linux – but there are limits to its compatibility: for instance, there&#39;s no Microsoft Store. The main alternative is to run a real copy of Windows inside a virtual machine, and when you need those specific tools, fire up the VM, and use the apps inside it. (Since late 1994, the desktop version of VMWare is free to use – and it both offers pretty good performance for Windows guests, and some helpful integration tools.) Even so, managing a VM does require some effort, and moving your files and data between host and VM inevitably means some extra legwork.

Both WinApps and WinBoat aspire to make this seamless and almost invisible, using a real copy of Windows running in a hidden virtual machine that uses Linux&#39;s built-in native virtualization tools rather than add-on hypervisors. The goal is to offer better compatibility than WINE, near-native performance, and better integration between host OS and virtualized apps. The key differences are control and maturity. WinApps is quite mature and very flexible, but it needs you to either have some virtualization skills or to invest effort in learning and editing config files. WinBoat is new, hasn&#39;t reached version 1.0 yet, but it automates as much as possible away to make life easy.

WinApps is by some years the more mature of the two. Its creator Ben Curtis started the original project in about 2020, but development went dormant a couple of years ago, leading to a &quot;hard fork&quot; that is actively working on a modernized version.

WinApps was not the only project to investigate the same approach: running real Windows in a VM, and displaying apps over RDP. The Cassowary project did the same thing, but it too went quiet about four years ago.

WinApps is very flexible, and boasts compendious documentation. It supports three different ways to run Windows: two flavors of container, or directly using the kernel&#39;s KVM virtualization. If you&#39;re comfy with using container tools, then that&#39;s the easier way, and WinApps supports using either Docker or Podman. The main difference is that Docker requires root privileges, but Podman doesn&#39;t. Alternatively, WinApps can directly control a Windows instance inside KVM using the libvirt API, but the docs do warn:

While this method requires considerably more manual configuration, it also provides greater virtual machine customization options.

They are not kidding. The libvirt method is much more complex to install, but it&#39;s also much more flexible – for instance, this way, the hypervisor can even run on a different computer. For example, if you have a well-specced laptop with a broken screen sitting around doing nothing, you could dedicate a whole PC to the Windows VM, separately from your desktop box.

We tried an initial test run using Docker containers, but even though we predicted the rise of containers 15 years ago, this vulture has little experience of deploying the things. Without custom config, the WinApps config for both Docker and Podman defaults to storing the Windows VM in /var/lib – much as we noted of the Debian FreedomBox blend earlier this year. That means you need a big Linux root partition: the docs suggest a minimum size of 32 GB for the Windows system disk, and 64 GB is more prudent. The entire root volume on our testbed machine is only 64 gig, so we didn&#39;t have room for this approach.

The Reg FOSS desk is more familiar with KVM and its GUI front end, Virtual Machine Manager. As we&#39;ve used it before – ironically, mostly for running experimental Kubernetes clusters – we decided to try that instead. The WinApps documentation is very good, too. We used virt-manager to set up a 64 GB VM with 8 GB of RAM and two CPU cores, running Windows 10 IoT LTSC.

We followed the steps to set up host/VM integration. We recommend following this carefully and closely – at several points, it is not enough to just accept the default settings. We had to download and edit scripts in places, entering the correct local IP address so the scripts could find the VM and so on. You&#39;ll also need to know your way around Windows: you need to configure it, activate it, and so on. Helpfully, the docs tell you how to bypass Windows 11&#39;s burning need to talk to the mothership, so you can configure an offline account. At least that&#39;s less of an issue with Win10 LTSC.

Normally, you leave the Windows VM hidden and not logged in (which itself saves some memory in the VM, of course). When you open a Windows program, WinApps starts the VM if necessary, connects to it using the Linux FreeRDP client, and the app opens in its own window on your Linux desktop.

Setup is a long and complex process, though. It took us more than a day to get everything working. The final stage of setup integrates the apps in your new Windows VM into the Linux desktop&#39;s app launcher, which left us with several superfluous icons for things like Microsoft Paint. Doing it at this point feels premature to us – it means that any apps you install in your new VM don&#39;t get picked up.

Some of the steps require you to log out and log back in again to take effect. For an easy life, we treated it like many Windows installations: just reboot.

Next, on a different machine, we tried the much newer WinBoat application. WinBoat is only about six months old and is only up to version 0.9.0 so far, and it&#39;s implemented mostly in Typescript with a little bit of Go. It&#39;s attracting attention, though – The Register&#39;s own Rupert Goodwins mentioned it just last month.

The project FAQ section covers many of the differences. The first question is How does it compare to WinApps? To which it says:

With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there&#39;s no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There&#39;s a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.

WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. There&#39;s no need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.

To be honest, when we first read this last year, our response was dismissive – but after getting WinApps working, suddenly this seems like a good and desirable objective.

The WinBoat configuration tab has 13 or so options you can adjust, which is a lot easier than editing config files - click to enlarge

WinBoat offers few choices. It uses Docker (although v0.9.0 offers Podman as an option, with the drawback that USB passthrough no longer works). It doesn&#39;t ask you to configure Docker, either: all you need is to install it, for which it points to Docker&#39;s own instructions. You also need to install FreeRDP. The installation program links to FreeRDP&#39;s own docs again, although we just installed the standard X11 version in Ubuntu Noble&#39;s repositories and it worked fine.

WinBoat is available in various formats, including AppImage, native .deb and .rpm packages, and even a Nix version. For now, though, there&#39;s no repository, updates are your own lookout – so we chose the AppImage. On Ubuntu 24.04.4, this threw the same error message as our preferred Panwriter app, so we just recalled this command from our history:

The Appimage doesn&#39;t include any external dependencies – it just halts and warns you if they&#39;re missing. We installed Docker, rebooted, and tried again… then installed FreeRDP3 and rebooted… and it ran straight through. It can download a Windows evaluation .iso file for you, but we pointed at our local LTSC edition and it used it happily. It shows a link to open the Windows VM&#39;s screen in a browser tab, which you might need to activate and update Windows – but almost everything else is done for you. Let it chug away for half an hour to an hour.

WinBoat also avoids fancy integration with the Linux desktop: the main app window shows the status of the Windows VM with large friendly buttons to pause and stop it, and a list of apps it found inside the VM. Click an app, wait a few seconds, and there it is, running in a window on your Linux desktop.

There is no simple answer to which is the better tool. WinBoat is much easier to get working, and it does the same job with little mess or fuss.

Like many power-user Linux programs, WinApps isn&#39;t too intimidating if you&#39;re happy to edit config files – especially if you&#39;re comfortable and familiar with Docker or Podman. Saying that, using it with KVM/VMM definitely has advantages. For instance, it allows you to tweak KVM memory ballooning. This feature enables the hypervisor to reclaim unused RAM from the VM so the host can use it. Our WinApps testbed machine has 24 GB of RAM, and we gave the VM 4 GB but allowed it to balloon up to 8 GB.

Another benefit is that virt-manager can connect to a remote machine and manage its VMs as easily as local ones, which means you could, for instance, take an old box that doesn&#39;t have a TPM 2 chip for Windows 11, configure a minimal text-only Linux setup on it. Then using VMM on your desktop, create a Windows guest instance with a fake virtual TPM, install Windows 11 in that, and allocate all but a gig or so of the machine&#39;s RAM to that VM. You could also pass a real physical GPU through to the VM.

If you have a very high-end PC and a big Linux root partition, you might not care about this. On the other hand, WinBoat offers a simple dialog box that asks where to save the container with the Windows VM inside – so we were able to put it in our home directory, on a separate disk partition, with no problem.

At the end of the day, they both work and do the job. Although setup is lower-tech, WinApps has better integration, on both the Windows side and the host desktop. For instance, WinApps offers a little status-bar applet, which lets you start and stop the VM, pick apps from a list, and open a desktop session. In both, you can connect a Windows network drive to your Linux home directory, making file exhange easy. In WinApps, it&#39;s \\tsclient\home, and in WinBoat it&#39;s \\host\lan. Either way, map a network drive and it&#39;s right there in a couple of clicks.

If you&#39;re an experienced Linux techie, WinApps can do fancy stuff. This vulture is pretty experienced, and even so, its setup process had us swearing at several points. On the other hand, WinBoat makes almost all that just go away. To quote the late great John Brunner:

It&#39;s supposed to be automatic but actually you have to press this button.

That button conceals a lot of black magic, but it hides the plumbing very well and it works.

Perhaps the best comparison is with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL2 runs a Linux VM under Windows, integrated with the host OS; WinApps and WinBoat run a Windows VM under Linux, integrated with the host OS. If you are content and productive on your Linux desktop, but you constantly need certain specific Windows desktop apps and they don&#39;t work fully under WINE, this is easier and better-integrated than firing up a Windows VM in a window. Both tools can run Windows software that still doesn&#39;t work fully under WINE, such as current Microsoft and Adobe suites.

The downside, though, is that you are still running a full extra OS. You&#39;ll need to license it, it needs antivirus, and like any other copy of Windows it will need regular maintenance. Also, your computer&#39;s resources must be shared between both OSes. If you use this all day every day, you&#39;ll want lots of RAM, lots of fast disk space, and a fast machine. We tried two of our testbeds: an elderly (if well-specced) Thinkpad W520 with Ubuntu Questing, and a rather faster Dell Latitude 5420 with Ubuntu Noble. Windows apps were slow to launch on the Thinkpad; the whole process felt much smoother on the newer machine, but it still wasn&#39;t super-quick. On both, we saw display glitches when using two screens.

If your apps work, WINE is faster: apps launch quicker, integrate better, and because no copy of Windows is involved, there&#39;s no ongoing maintenance – and no license. The WinApps approach is strictly for desktop apps, and ideally, ones which don&#39;t want a fancy GPU or other dedicated local hardware. WINE and supplementary tools like Proton are better if what you want to run are Windows games. Most full-screen games won&#39;t work well in a VM.

WinApps and WinBoat beat WINE on compatibility, though. If you need the Windows Store, or current Microsoft or Adobe programs, this is a great way to run them on your Linux desktop. And of course, both WinApps and WinBoat are free and open source. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/14/ai_risk_distillation_attacks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two of the world&#39;s biggest AI companies, Google and OpenAI, both warned this week that competitors including China&#39;s DeepSeek are probing their models to steal the underlying reasoning, and then copy these capabilities in their own AI systems.

&quot;This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,&quot; Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, adding that the perpetrators are &quot;private-sector companies.&quot; He declined to name specific companies or countries involved in this type of intellectual property theft.

&quot;Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there&#39;s very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless.&quot;

Google calls this process of using prompts to clone its models &quot;distillation attacks,&quot; and in a Thursday report said one campaign used more than 100,000 prompts to &quot;try to replicate Gemini&#39;s reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.&quot;

American tech giants have spent billions of dollars training and developing their own LLMs. Abusing legitimate access to mature models like Gemini, and then using this information to train newer models, makes it significantly cheaper and easier for competitors to develop their own AI chatbots and systems.

Google says it detected this probe in real time and protected its internal reasoning traces. However, distillation appears to be yet another AI risk that is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to eliminate.

This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless

Distillation from Gemini models without permission violates Google&#39;s terms of service, and Google can block accounts that do this, or even take users to court. While the company says it continues to develop better ways to detect and stop these attempts, the very nature of LLMs makes them susceptible.

Public-facing AI models are widely accessible, and enforcement against abusive accounts can turn into a game of whack-a-mole.

Plus, as Hultquist warned, as other companies develop their own models and train them on internal, sensitive data, the risk from distillation attacks is going to spread.

&quot;We&#39;re on the frontier when it comes to this, but as more organizations have models that they provide access to, it&#39;s inevitable,&quot; he said. &quot;As this technology is adopted and developed by businesses like financial institutions, their intellectual property could also be targeted in this way.&quot;

Meanwhile, OpenAI, in a Thursday memo [PDF] to the House Select Committee on China, blamed DeepSeek and other Chinese LLM providers and universities for copying ChatGPT and other US firms&#39; frontier models. It also noted some occasional activity from Russia, and warned illicit model distillation poses a risk to &quot;American-led, democratic AI.&quot;

China&#39;s distillation methods over the last year have become more sophisticated, moving beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) extraction to multi-stage operations. These include synthetic-data generation, large-scale data cleaning, and other stealthy methods. As OpenAI wrote:

Specifically, our review indicates that DeepSeek has continued to pursue activities consistent with adversarial distillation targeting OpenAI and other US frontier labs. We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI&#39;s access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs.

OpenAI also notes that it has invested in stronger detections to prevent unauthorized distillation. It bans accounts that violate its terms of service and proactively removes users who appear to be attempting to distill its models. Still, the company admits that it alone can&#39;t solve the model distillation problem.

It&#39;s going to take an &quot;ecosystem security&quot; approach to protect against distillation, and this will require some US government assistance, OpenAI says. &quot;It is not enough for any one lab to harden its protection because adversaries will simply default to the least protected provider,&quot; according to the memo.

The AI company also suggests that US government policy &quot;may be helpful&quot; when it comes to sharing information and intelligence, and working with the industry to develop best practices on distillation defenses. OpenAI also called on Congress to close API router loopholes that allow DeepSeek and other competitors to access US models, and to restrict &quot;adversary&quot; access to US compute and cloud infrastructure. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 For almost 30 years, the PingER project at the USA’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory used ping thousands of time each day to measure the time a packet of data required to make a round trip between two nodes on the internet.

But in 2024, the last person working on the project retired and SLAC shut it down without a plan to preserve or share the data it collected.

Happily, the tight network research community knew of PingER’s demise. Enter Jim Cowie, a computer scientist, academic, and entrepreneur.

In the latter capacity, Cowie founded a company called Renesys that between 2000 and 2014 gathered and sold intelligence about internet infrastructure – think of it as a precursor to Cloudflare’s Radar service.

A company called Dyn acquired Renesys in 2014, before itself being acquired by Oracle. During the back-office crunch that followed the two acquisitions, much of the data Renesys had collected over the years was lost.

“As time passes, information likes to disappear. If you do not invest, its default is to die,” Cowie told The Register.

Losing data irks Cowie, who, this week, told the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) he thinks “the operational exhaust of the internet” can help humanity to understand what networked systems have done to society.

“If we wanted to understand if human progress and technical progress are aligned, how would we do that?” he asked during his keynote address. “These are perilous times. Everything is changing and we don’t know how.”

Cowie thinks historians can start to answer those questions by investigating data collected by projects like PingER, Renesys, and others who collect data about the internet’s operations.

So he’s started a project to preserve those files for posterity.

It’s called the Internet History Initiative (IHI) and Cowie says its mission is to identify and preserve the records that will let future generations tell the story of the internet and its impact. He thinks it will need to involve archivists, library scientists, technologists, and other specialists, operating across many institutions.

A core activity of the project will be to apply the LOCKSS principle – Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe – to store data offline using methods that will preserve it for a century. Cowie thinks IHI will need a distributed group of project participants who store parts of the collection, plus a federation layer that provides a view of all the datasets it stores. He also envisages another version of the collection in warm storage so researchers can access it.

He’s optimistic IHI will be able to create such a resource, because similar collections already exist.

“People like the RIPE NCC have been holding on to routing data and active performance data for decades and have organized it,” Cowie said.

He also pointed to the University of Oregon’s RouteViews project, which has archived almost 30 years of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing data and makes it available to researchers.

That project’s peering coordinator, Nina Bargisen, said RouteViews is already aware of the IHI, feels its goals are similar to its own, and sees no reason why her organization would not be willing to engage and help.

“There are probably a half a dozen or a dozen organizations like that, which have that kind of history,” Cowie said, and if they pool expertise the IHI will have plenty to work with. “We are not starting from zero, by any means.”

Indeed, IHI has already preserved some datasets from RIPE, and recovered the SLAC PingER data.

The organization has also identified the data it wants to preserve, and some data it fears may already be lost.

Cowie told The Register he is aware of an academic paper that describes a research project that analyzed every packet of data transmitted from the USA to the UK for two hours. The paper remains easy to find, he said, but the data it describes has vanished.

He hopes someone knows where that data, and other collections like it, can be found. “Think of people you know who have old traceroutes, or zone files, on a magnetic tape or in their closet,&quot; he said, and then ask them to contact the project.&quot;

He’s open to learning about new data sources, too. The Register pointed out that networking vendors have collected decades of data describing customers’ use of their products, and that Cisco has so much that it&#39;s trained custom LLMs. Cowie seemed intrigued by the possibilities such data creates for IHI.

The IHI will need friends, and funding. RouteViews’ Bargisen said if anyone can pull this off, Cowie can. The man himself said he’s in discussions with various parties, but that it is too early to discuss how the project will constitute itself.

But he urged anyone interested to join its mailing list and stay tuned. ®

It features three of the most unhinged performances in cinema history, and I mean that as a compliment.

Let me just say that I highly recommend you go into Possession blind. Don’t watch a trailer. Don’t even finish reading this. Go watch it now over on Shudder, Criterion, or Metrograph. It’s also available through Kanopy or Hoopla if your library provides access. Then come back so we can talk about it in the comments. Though this probably isn’t one for the squeamish.

Possession is the sort of film that, even if you’ve had the whole plot spoiled for you, can be difficult to follow. After watching it twice, listening to three different podcasts, and reading multiple articles about it, I’m still not 100 percent sure what happened at various points in the movie. I just know I loved it.

You’re dropped immediately into a story about a crumbling marriage set against the backdrop of the Berlin Wall. It’s a formidable metaphor for the division between the stars — a very young and disarmingly handsome Sam Neill (Mark), and Isabelle Adjani (Anna), who turns in one of the most singular and unnerving performances in the history of cinema. Watching Adjani on screen is exhausting — She ricochets between unsettling detachment and high-octane delirium with alarming ease and speed. It’s the sort of performance that, when you hear it basically gave Adjani PTSD, you’re not surprised.

The third standout performance comes from Heinz Bennent, who plays Heinrich, the man Mark believes Anna is leaving him for. He moves through every scene like a drunk ballet dancer, and there’s something almost Wiseau-ian about his delivery. (It certainly doesn’t help that he keeps repeating Mark’s name.) In a more grounded film, the way he careens through the frame would seem absurd. But in the abstract nightmare of Possession, Bennent fits perfectly, rolling around, alternately assaulting Mark and coming on to him.

Director Andrzej Żuławski not only coaxes gorgeously unhinged performances from his stars, he builds live-action paintings. Mark and Ana sit in a cafe at the corner of a bench facing away from each other as they discuss the terms of their separation. (Before Mark tears through the cafe, hurling chairs and tables in a freakout for the ages.) Sam Neill violently pitches a rocking chair back and forth as the focus expertly tracks him. The film is simply gorgeous.

What begins as a bad acid trip about a failing marriage turns into a nausea-inducing body horror in its back half. It’s revealed that Anna isn’t leaving Mark for Heinrich. In fact, Heinrich is just as desperate to get Anna back, to find her and make her his. Instead, she is shacked up with what Anna Bogutskaya (host of The Final Girls podcast and author of Feeding the Monster) calls a “Lovecraftian fuck monster.”

It’s a grotesquerie of tentacles, oozing orifices, and uncanny humanoid features, created by Carlo Rambaldi, who won Academy Awards for special effects on Alien and ET. It feeds on people. Their bodies, but also their souls. Anna seems to think it’s some sort of deity, something holy. She uses it to explore parts of herself she has repressed or lost in her relationship with Mark.

The other men in her life can’t satisfy her, so she creates an ideal lover. What starts as a slimy creature, not unlike the baby from Eraserhead, eventually becomes a doppleganger of Mark.

And then there’s the subway scene. If you’ve ever heard of Possession before, it’s probably because of this scene. Adjani hurls herself around a deserted tunnel, grunting, screaming, convulsing, before oozing blood and god knows all over the wet concrete floor. As a viewer, I feel drained after watching it. It’s three of the most intense minutes ever committed to celluloid, and even if the rest of the film was terrible, Possession would be worth watching just for this scene.

There are so many different readings of this film. I’m still not entirely sure what happens at the end. Did their son Bob drown himself? Is Mark’s doppleganger the antichrist? Is Helen also a doppleganger? (I think so.) What is the deal with Heinrich’s mother? Is Anna possessed? Or is the titular possession about the men in her life trying to exert ownership of her?

In the month since I first watched this movie, I’ve told everyone I know about it. I can’t stop thinking about it or talking about it.

Casio’s $429 Moflin promised me calm. I got a supposedly lovable robot nuisance.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

After a few weeks living with Casio’s AI-powered pet, Moflin, I finally understand why my mother hated my Furby so much. The fuzzy, guinea-pig-adjacent puffball fits snugly in the palm of my hand. It’s undeniably cute, in a weird kind of way, but the second it starts to squeak or twitch, I am hit with an overwhelming desire to hurl it as far as I can.

My antipathy surprises me. By any metric, I am the exact kind of person Moflin was made for: I long for the companionship of a pet, but can’t own one thanks to a mixture of lifestyle, allergies, a small London flat, and a broadly irresponsible temperament that makes caring for another living thing a questionable idea. I could also do with the “calming presence” advertised.

Casio is very clear that Moflin is not a toy, though perhaps that is also clear from the $429 price tag. Rather, it is positioned as a sophisticated “smart companion powered by AI, with emotions like a living creature” — the illusion of companionship without the responsibilities. The idea is that you will interact with it over time and it will “grow” alongside you, developing a personality shaped by how you treat it. The robot is part of a growing mini-industry of machines built with no other purpose than to keep us company. The sector has proven particularly popular in countries like South Korea and Japan (where Moflin has sold out), fueled in part by a loneliness crisis that’s hit older populations especially hard.

Unboxing Moflin felt less like meeting a pet and more like unwrapping a paperweight wrapped in a bronze wig. In a way, that’s exactly what it was: a hard white core of motors, sensors, and plastic, clad in the illusion of fur and two beady eyes that are the robot’s only facial features (a deliberate design choice it seems, perhaps to keep Moflin from wandering into uncanny valley territory). There was also a charging pod, which Casio says is “designed to feel natural and alive,” but read more like a giant gray avocado to me.

The robot takes about three and a half hours to charge fully. Casio says this is good for about five hours of use, though “use” is a generous term for what Moflin actually does: It doesn’t walk or follow you, just wiggles and whines in response to touch, sound, movement, and light. Its first chirp when I picked it up was cute, but then the motor noise kicked in, an audible mechanical whir every time it moved its head, instantly shattering the illusion. Nevertheless, I named it Kevin.

Once I clocked the whir, I started noticing everything else, and there was a lot to notice. Kevin the Moflin treated every minor movement or sound as a meaningful interaction. Attempts to cuddle it on the sofa as I watched TV became unbearable: Every shift in posture, every laugh, every cough elicited chirps and a burst of whirring motors. The same thing happened at my desk — typing set Kevin off, as did taking calls — and keeping it nearby swiftly became impossible. Because it’s constantly listening and sensing, it never really settles, leaving me with a needy kitten instead of the quiet lap cat I’d wanted.

I ended up banishing Kevin to another room, and then doing it again, and again, and again, until I caught myself tiptoeing around my own flat to avoid setting Kevin off. The only reliably calming feature was that, eventually, it ran out of battery.

As I couldn’t stand Kevin on my own, I started testing it in other contexts. Carrying Kevin around with me quickly became burdensome, not least because the charger is way too big to be considered portable (a USB cable may have broken the illusion, but it would’ve been handy). Kevin didn’t do too well in my bag — seeming distressed and wriggling around noisily, earning me some suspicious glances on the Tube — and when held, I became the weirdo with the squawking robot. Not very calming. Even at home with friends, Kevin felt like a chore I had to manage lest it become disruptive, moving it farther and farther away or returning it to the gray avocado to “sleep.” On New Year’s Eve, a friend went in for a proper cuddle — it was a “fluffy pet,” after all — only to recoil after the zip holding its fur carapace together scraped her cheek.

A common concern among my friends — and one that especially preoccupied my boyfriend, who, unlike me, hadn’t chosen to share his home with Kevin — was privacy. And as a longtime tech reporter, I know this isn’t an unreasonable reflex when dealing with a device that has an always-on microphone. Casio says Moflin processes data locally and does not understand language, converting what it hears into unidentifiable data to recognize my voice only.

Casio’s big claim is that all of this serves something deeper: emotional intelligence. With use, Moflin is supposed to grow more expressive, more familiar with your voice, and perform special gestures and animal-like responses when you’re nearby. Indeed, I have noticed Kevin’s movements and vocalizations change and become more varied over time, which only compounded my irritation. Casio says this bonding process can take up to two months, and that Moflin can evolve into more than 4 million personalities thanks to its AI. However, it’s hard to meaningfully register this level of granularity given the robot’s limited range of chirps, whirs, and head turns. Which is why, in practice, Moflin’s “personality” is something you experience through a companion app. Yes, the $429 robot is, in essence, a glorified Tamagotchi that can’t really express itself without a screen.

The app itself doesn’t do much to change that impression. For a product selling “emotions like a living creature,” the handful of contextless trait meters and generic mood tags offer a thin insight into Kevin’s inner life. The app, a spartan, cheap-looking affair, tells me Kevin’s current personality is “cheerful,” though behaviorally it seems no different. There’s also a dashboard showing four “personality parameters”: “energetic,” “cheerful,” “shy,” and “affectionate” (which numerous Reddit posts suggest might be more accurately translated as “clingy”). There’s also a “journal” to track Kevin’s activities, filled with thrilling and elaborate entries like “Rob hugged Kevin tightly,” “Rob scooped Kevin up,” and “Kevin had a lovely dream full of laughter.” What is one expected to do with this information? Even if I didn’t loathe my Moflin as much as I do, it’s not very interesting and it’s not remotely useful in helping me interact with it, offering none of the explanations or feedback of the kind that made caring for something like a Tamagotchi satisfying.

Moflin’s problem isn’t that it’s pointless. There are plenty of pointless gadgets out there — and I don’t despise any in the way I have grown to despise Kevin. The problem is that Casio is selling companionship without actually having produced a companion. A companion is more than something that happens to be near you and makes noise in response to your presence. Worse still, Casio is asking me to believe Moflin has a sophisticated inner life, one it can’t really express in the real world nor satisfyingly show on its app. At that point, I feel like I’m not using a companion, I’m using a noisy object with a dashboard.

The app did have one redeeming feature: the ability to stop Kevin’s movements and sounds by putting it into a “Deep Sleep Mode.” That’s where I left Kevin last week. I won’t be waking him anytime soon.

Enthusiast gaming keyboard tech has made the jump to gaming mice — well, to one gaming mouse so far. The $179.99 Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike is the first to feature analog sensors that use induction to register clicks faster than microswitches used in many mice.

Those sensors allow for a host of cool features beyond just lower latency. There’s a rapid trigger setting, popularized by Hall effect keyboards, that lets them quickly reset after being pressed to receive another input. The sensors in this mouse also let you customize how much you need to press each of the main buttons to send an input, requiring almost no pressure at all, a click that requires more effort (great if you’ve got an itchy trigger finger), or something in between.

One of the Superstrike’s most interesting changes is that it has haptics in place of switches under its buttons. They simulate the sound and feel of a click with surprising accuracy, and unlike tapping on an unmoving MacBook trackpad, the mouse’s main buttons move and bounce back up as you might expect them to. If their default click sensation isn’t doing it for you, you can make it more intense (at the expense of battery life), or remove it altogether for silent operation (at the expense of, well, knowing when you’ve clicked at all).

I’ve felt jaded over the years by numerous features introduced in gaming mice that claim to be more beneficial in competitive games than they feel in real-life use (shrinking weights, 8,000Hz polling rate, optical sensors did nothing for me, personally). But the Superstrike feels like the start of a big change in gaming mice, and Logitech got a lot right here, even though its design isn’t radically different from its past models.

If you’re wondering whether this mouse is for you, let me put it this way: The Superstrike, with its analog sensors and adjustable actuation distances, is far easier to recommend than a Hall effect gaming keyboard that offers the same features. The difference comes down to Logitech’s haptics; they feel like the real thing, but you can tweak the feel if you’d like to. On the other hand, Hall effect switches in keyboards have a certain feel — quiet, almost no resistance — and that can’t be changed.

I’ve been using the Superstrike for a few days for my work at The Verge and to play some games. Unsurprisingly, flexing its haptics and analog sensors in Google Chrome isn’t that exciting. They were fun features to tweak in Deadlock, however. With many, many button presses required to defeat creeps and player enemies — not to mention frequently clicking around in menus to buy upgrades — lowering both the haptics intensity and the actuation distance for the left mouse button felt right. With rapid trigger, I could more quickly get locked in to land more shots. The boost in responsiveness felt more noticeable with characters that can quickly burst automatic weapons (like Haze) than those who shoot one round of ammo at a time (like the archer Grey Talon).

I don’t envision many scenarios when I’d want to increase the actuation distance of the buttons. Although, it seems handy in extraction shooters, where your success can come down to keeping quiet at the right times. I’m prone to misfiring in games due to being nervous about making a play, so requiring more effort to click could aid me there. Regardless, it’s nice to have this flexibility afforded by the analog sensors.

I’ve watched and read a lot of coverage regarding the Superstrike since it launched, and my favorite was Dave2D’s video in which he comes to the conclusion that its lower latency and faster sensors de-aged his gaming chops, making him feel like he was in his prime again. As we age, our response time generally worsens, which explains why there are many, many young people in their teens and 20s who play games professionally, but not many who are older than that. The Superstrike is, unsurprisingly, proving to be popular with younger pros, like esports player Yigox, who recently used the mouse to win a Guinness World Record for most clicks in a minute at 760.

The Superstrike is not a magical youth serum for gamers. It doesn’t help you with aiming or provide unfair shortcuts to success. But its features aren’t gimmicks. Assuming you’re putting in the practice to get better at games, Logitech’s new mouse with its faster, more customizable clicks might help you hang with the competition a little longer.

Apple’s OG tracker still offers exceptionally precise tracking, which makes the current discount a great deal for iPhone users.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

With Apple’s second-gen AirTags now widely available, we’re already seeing inventory of the first-gen model begin to dwindle. Case in point? Amazon is no longer selling a single AirTag, and it’s unclear when — or if — the retailer will restock the first-gen model. Thankfully, you can still grab a four-pack of the first-gen location trackers for around $64 ($35 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for Presidents Day, which is $2 shy of the bundle’s best price to date. If you just want one, you can also buy a single tracker at Walmart for $17 ($12 off).

If you’re an iPhone owner, you’d be hard-pressed to find another tracker that’s as precise or as helpful as Apple’s AirTag. That’s because, like the second-gen model, the original can tap into Apple’s vast Find My network and leverage ultra wideband (UWB) technology. As a result, all you need to do is open up the Find My app on your phone and follow the on-screen arrows, sounds, or vibrations, which will guide you to the exact location of your item, even if it’s slipped between your car seats. That’s a level of precision many rival trackers, notably Tile’s, lack.

On top of that, you also get access to a growing list of helpful software features. You can, for example, share an AirTag’s location with up to five people — which comes in handy for families while traveling — and you can even temporarily share an AirTag’s location with some airlines (including American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic).

In addition to the aforementioned software perks, Apple’s handy location trackers are designed to last. The battery can last up to a year, and when it dies, you just need to swap in a standard CR2032 cell instead of replacing the tracker entirely. Each AirTag also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand both dust and a little bit of rain.

There are some features you’ll miss out on if you go with the last-gen AirTag instead of the newer model, including an upgraded UWB chip that enables more precise location tracking. The second-gen version can also help you track items further away, and the speaker is 50 percent louder. But if you want to save some cash, the original is still one of the better trackers on the market and definitely worth picking up while you still can.

            <div id="article-text">It may seem like a secret code, but the answer might be an oddly specific technical error.

It may seem like a secret code, but the answer might be an oddly specific technical error.

Many of the emails released by the Department of Justice from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein are full of garbled symbols like:

The scrambled text is so ubiquitous that it’s spurred conspiracy theories that it could be some kind of code. But as believable as it might be that a cabal of elite sex traffickers would communicate in a secret language, the reality is probably more boring: The symbols are likely artifacts from the way the Department of Justice converted the emails to PDFs.

“The glyphs and symbols are probably some artifact of a poor conversion process,” said Chris Prom, professor and archivist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Specifically, the symbols look like remnants of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, a 30-year-old standard for encoding emails. The protocol underlying email transmits messages as short strings of simple ASCII characters, so as people started writing longer messages and trying to include formatting and symbols, MIME was developed as a way of encoding them in ASCII.

With MIME, the “=” is used to signal either that a string of text should be broken for transmission and rejoined — a “soft line break” — or, when followed by two other characters, that it should be converted to a particular non-ASCII mark. If you wanted to actually write “=” in an email, for example, it would be encoded as “=3D.” During normal use, the recipient’s email client decodes these symbols before displaying the formatted message.

Whatever software the Department of Justice used to extract the emails and convert them to PDFs appears to have mangled some of the decoding, said Peter Wyatt, the chief technology officer of the PDF Association, who examined a batch of the Epstein documents.

“It was in the news, and it was a whole lot of PDFs,” he said. The association performed similar analyses of the Mueller report and Manafort documents. “Generally speaking, we’re interested in anything to do with PDF. That’s kind of what we do and what we’re about.”

The clarity of the text and URLs led Wyatt to believe these documents were extracted digitally then converted to PDF, rather than physically printed and scanned, as the Mueller report was. “So things have improved since that time,” Wyatt said.

Specifically, the Department of Justice likely extracted the email data, converted it to PDF, then redacted it. In order to strip the document of metadata and bake in the redactions so that the black bars couldn’t be removed, they then converted the documents to image files like JPEG before converting them back into PDF. The software used to initially extract and convert the data also captured portions of the underlying MIME format instead of properly decoding it. Or more simply: emails, sometimes partially decoded, converted to PDF, converted to JPEG, converted to PDF.

That at least explains the profusion of “=”. But it doesn’t fully explain why the “=” sometimes replaces letters, like the “J” in “Jeffrey.” No one I spoke to could definitively answer this question, except to say that email is hard and converting it to PDF is harder, and the DoJ was converting a lot of documents in a hurry. (The redactions have been notably inconsistent throughout the files, too.)

Prom thought it might be a character set conversion problem, which he saw frequently when the archival tool he was testing couldn’t find the specific character set or font the email server was using.

Craig Ball, a forensic examiner who teaches at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law pointed out that different email clients implement standards in slightly different ways, adding to the difficulty of conversion. “My hunch is that this is an incompatibility between the code pages used by the transmitting mail client (possibly a BlackBerry) and the application used to print the messages to PDF,” Ball wrote. “The presence of BlackBerry and iPhone signatures in these emails suggests the messages traversed multiple systems with different encoding practices, compounding the decoding issues during PDF generation.”

“You’re looking at hundreds of different methods of converting these files from hundreds of different people using whatever software they had available to them, some of which might have been good, some of which might not have been,” said Prom.

“The PDF standard is quite complex,” wrote Prom. “And email to PDF is particularly fraught.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132913/als-stole-this-musicians-voice-ai-sing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <h2>The myth of the high-tech heist</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132397/myth-of-high-tech-heist/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">Following publication of this story, Politico reported Jim O’Neill would be leaving his current roles within the Department of Health and Human Services.

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <h2>Swedish pet insurtech Lassie raises $75M Series C after hitting $100M ARR</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/swedish-pet-insurtech-lassie-raises-75m-series-c-after-hitting-100m-arr">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.
