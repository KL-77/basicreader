            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.29 of the Rocket Report! We have a stuffed report this week with news from across the launch spectrum. Long-term, probably the most significant development this week was a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket successfully launching and then executing a picture-perfect ocean landing. China is catching up rapidly to the United States when it comes to reusable launch.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Orbex is going away. The UK-based launch company Orbex has entered insolvency proceedings after a planned takeover by European space logistics startup The Exploration Company fell through, European Spaceflight reports. In a statement, Orbex said the decision came after all “fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully.” For anyone paying attention, this decision should not come as a surprise. A decade into its existence, Orbex had yet to produce demonstrable, ready-for-flight hardware.

Other companies interested in assets … According to the company, the appointment of administrators will give Orbex time to secure “as positive an outcome as possible for its creditors, employees and wider stakeholders.” It added that the process could include the sale of all or parts of the business or its assets, and another UK-based company, Skyrora, has expressed some interest.

Firefly’s next Alpha mission launching soon. This week, Firefly said that its next Alpha rocket underwent a successful 20-second static fire test. This clears the way for the rocket to make a launch attempt no earlier than February 18 from its launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

Au revoir Block I … It’s an important mission, because the previous Alpha launch, in April 2025, ended in failure when stage separation damaged one of the rocket’s upper stage engines and prevented the mission from reaching orbit. Moreover, the company lost the first stage of the flight in September during an accident in Texas. The upcoming flight, “Stairway to Seven,” will be the final flight of Block I of the Alpha booster.

How can launch companies compete with SpaceX? Rocket firms are divided on how to compete with SpaceX in a market where demand outstrips supply, yet customers remain price sensitive, Space News reports. During a panel at the SmallSat Symposium on February 11, executives from several launch companies acknowledged the challenge of competing with SpaceX, which accounted for about half of all orbital launches globally in 2025, despite strong customer demand for launch services.

A low price is nice … “If your idea is to go into the market competing with SpaceX on price, you’re probably not in a good competitive position,” said Brian Rogers, vice president of global launch services at Rocket Lab, one of the few small launch vehicle developers to thrive despite competition from SpaceX. But this view was far from universal. Devon Papandrew, vice president of business development at Stoke Space, disagreed. “You absolutely have to have a plan to compete with SpaceX on price,” he said.

Rocket Lab blows up a few Archimedes engines. According to reporting by Ars, Rocket Lab has blown up two Archimedes rocket engines in the last three months at its test stand in southern Mississippi. The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year.

Testing the engine to its limits … Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns in a statement. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket,” Beck said. “We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.” Beck has previously said that Rocket Lab’s goal is to identify failures during component-level testing so that, when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first attempt.

Proton rocket returns to flight. After a nearly three-year break, a Russian Proton rocket flew again with the Elektro-L No. 5 meteorological satellite from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, Russian Space Web reports. This mission was supposed to launch in late 2025, but in December, final checks revealed a problem with the Block DM-03 upper stage.

A not-so-great launch record … The mission marked the last use of the Block DM-03 space tug on Proton, which will now be solely used as an upper stage for the Angara-5 rocket. First launched in 1965, the Proton rocket has undergone several upgrades in the six decades since then. It has launched 430 times, with 48 partial and total failures. No new Protons are under construction, and it will be phased out by the end of this decade in favor of the newer Angara vehicles. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX exempted legal labor case. The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company, Ars reports. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies.

A common carrier? … In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case.

More powerful Ariane 6 rocket launches. This first launch of the four-booster version of Ariane 6 took place on Thursday, launching  32 satellites for Amazon’s Leo constellation to low-Earth orbit. “This first flight of Ariane 64 sustains Europe’s autonomous access to space,” Toni Tolker-Nielsen, the European Space Agency’s director of space transportation, said  in a news release.

More vrooom coming … Previous launches of Europe’s new Ariane rocket have used two solid rocket boosters. The heavier variant of the rocket is necessary to support Amazon’s constellation as well as more demanding missions to geostationary orbit. And more power is coming. In the near future, the P120C boosters will be replaced by upgraded P160C models, each carrying more than 14 metric tons of solid fuel. The Associated Press provided some interesting color behind the scenes of the launch from the location in France where the rocket’s main engines are manufactured.

Stoke Space increases fundraising round. The Washington-based launch company announced this week that it had extended its recent Series D funding round. The round was initially announced in October 2025 at $510 million, but has now been increased to $860 million. The original Series D funding focused on completing activation of Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, and expanding production capacity for the Nova launch vehicle. Stoke will use the additional capital to accelerate future elements of its product roadmap, the company said.

Putting the $ into $toke $pace … “We’re extremely grateful for our investors’ continued support,” said Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Stoke. “We’re executing with urgency to bring Nova to market and deliver for our customers. It’s a special vehicle, and there’s more in the pipeline.” With the extension, Stoke has now raised $1.34 billion to date. That is an impressive raise, and it will heighten expectations for the company’s debut of the Nova rocket.

Falcon 9 back after second stage anomaly. A Falcon 9 launched a batch of Starlink satellites on Saturday after SpaceX completed an investigation into an engine malfunction during the rocket’s previous launch, Space News reports. The rocket deployed its payload of 25 Starlink satellites into orbit about 62 minutes after liftoff. The launch was the first Falcon 9 mission since Feb. 2, when the rocket carried another set of Starlink satellites into orbit from Vandenberg.

That didn’t take long … While that mission successfully deployed its payload, SpaceX later said an “off-nominal condition” with the upper stage prevented it from performing a planned deorbit burn. The Federal Aviation Administration said Feb. 6 that it had authorized SpaceX to return the Falcon 9 to flight. “The final mishap report cites the probable root cause as the Falcon 9 second-stage engine’s failure to ignite prior to the deorbit burn,” the agency stated. “SpaceX identified technical and organizational preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the event.” The FAA provided no additional details about the anomaly.

China performs an impressive rocket landing. China’s space program, striving to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030, carried out a test flight of a new reusable booster and crew capsule late Tuesday (US time), and the results were spectacular, Ars reports. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q.

China getting there on rocket reuse … The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore.

Vulcan experiences a second nozzle issue. Moments after liftoff from Florida’s Space Coast early Thursday morning, a shower of sparks emerged in the exhaust plume of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. Seconds later, the rocket twisted on its axis before recovering and continuing the climb into orbit with a batch of US military satellites, Ars reports. The sight may have appeared familiar to seasoned rocket watchers. Sixteen months ago, a Vulcan rocket lost one of its booster nozzles shortly after launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The rocket recovered from the malfunction and still reached the mission’s planned orbit.

Next launch likely to be delayed … Details of Thursday’s booster problem remain unclear. An investigation into the matter is underway, according to ULA, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But the circumstances resemble those of the booster malfunction in October 2024. The incident on Thursday’s mission suggests the defect was not fixed, or there is a separate problem with Northrop’s boosters. The next Vulcan launch is scheduled for no earlier than March with a GPS navigation satellite for the US Space Force. This schedule is now in doubt. The military’s Space Systems Command said in a statement it will “work closely with ULA per our mission assurance space flightworthiness process before the next Vulcan national security space mission.” (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Starship nearing next test flight. The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster, Ars reports. The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3, or Block 3.

Launch possible within the next six to eight weeks … SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3. Assuming that the remaining test work goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March.

New Glenn pushing on second stage reuse again. Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it. The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines?

Do you want a job? … Now, Ars reports, reuse is back on the menu. Blue Origin has posted a new job listing for a director of Reusable Upper Stage Development, which says, “As the Director of Program Management for the New Glenn Upper Stage and Payload Accommodations (GS2PA), you will work with the Vice President of New Glenn GS2PA and directly support the execution of a lean engineering initiative to incrementally develop a reusable upper stage.” Ars estimates it presently costs Blue Origin more than $50 million to manufacture a New Glenn second stage.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/platforms-bend-over-backward-to-help-dhs-censor-ice-critics-advocates-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online.

Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.”

It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint from the developer of an app called ICEBlock, which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands.

That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning.

FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected.

Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an escalating pattern of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes.

Officials have ordered ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores and even threatened to sanction CNN for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made multiple unsuccessful attempts to unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups. Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News reported.

As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing&#39;” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) reported.

For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen.

Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation.

“The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s complaint said.

EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment.

Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars.

They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said.

“If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said.

But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests.

Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began.

“That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said.

Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said.

An open letter from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users.

The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.”

More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late.

After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said.

“This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said.

Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests.

In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users.

Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested.

That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.”

The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps like ICEBlock and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content.

FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.”

The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said.

Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.”

Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.”

Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.”

Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.”

McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing.

“Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued.

The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock.

“It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.”

Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.”

Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government.

McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE.

“When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.”

Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it.

To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts.

If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds.

Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The heavy version of Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched for the first time Thursday, hauling 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon’s satellite broadband constellation.

The Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center on the northeastern coast of South America at 11:45 am EST (16:45 UTC), quickly soaring into a clear sky at the tropical spaceport on the power of a hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid rocket boosters.

This Ariane 6 configuration, called Ariane 64, is the first to use the rocket’s full complement of four boosters. Collectively, the rocket generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust (15,400 kilonewtons) of thrust as it steered northeast over the Atlantic Ocean. Less than two hours later, the rocket’s upper stage released all 32 of Amazon’s satellites into an on-target orbit at an altitude of 289 miles (465 kilometers).

Amazon and Arianespace, the French launch services provider, declared the mission a success.

“With the powerful roar of four boosters at liftoff comes more than double the payload mass to orbit, setting Europe back on stage for launching all satellites to all orbits,” said Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, which funded development of the Ariane 6. “With today’s launch, our rocket fleet is now complete, but we will not rest. Upgrades are already in progress for future launches, starting with the launch of our planet-hunter Plato that is set to launch on an upgraded Ariane 6.”

“With the first flight of Ariane 64, Europe’s heavy-lift launcher has demonstrated its ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale constellation missions,” said David Cavaillolès, CEO of Arianespace. “We are proud to support Amazon Leo with a reliable, high-performance European launch solution as we begin a series of 18 missions enabling the deployment of their constellation.”

The Ariane 64 flew with an extended payload shroud to fit all 32 Amazon Leo satellites. Combined, the payload totaled around 20 metric tons, or about 44,000 pounds, according to Arianespace. This is close to maxing out the Ariane 64’s lift capability.

Amazon has booked more than 100 missions across four launch providers to populate the company’s planned fleet of more than 3,200 satellites. With Thursday’s launch, Amazon has launched 214 production satellites on eight missions with United Launch Alliance, SpaceX, and now Arianespace.

The Amazon Leo constellation is a competitor with SpaceX’s Starlink Internet network. SpaceX now has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit beaming broadband to more than 9 million subscribers, and all have launched on the company’s own Falcon 9 rockets. Amazon, meanwhile, initially bypassed SpaceX when selecting which companies would launch satellites for the Amazon Leo program, formerly known as Project Kuiper.

Amazon booked the last nine launches on ULA’s soon-to-retire Atlas V, five of which have now flown, and reserved the rest of its launches in 2022 on rockets that had never launched before: 38 flights on ULA’s new Vulcan rocket, 24 launches on Blue Origin’s New Glenn, and 18 on Europe’s Ariane 6.

All three new rockets suffered delays but are now in service. The Ariane 6 has enjoyed the fastest ramp-up in launch cadence, with six flights under its belt after Thursday’s mission from French Guiana. ULA’s Vulcan rocket has flown four times, and Amazon says its first batch of satellites to fly on Vulcan is now complete. But a malfunction with one of the Vulcan launcher’s solid rocket boosters on a military launch from Florida early Thursday—the second such anomaly in three flights—raises questions about when Amazon will get its first ride on Vulcan.

Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is gearing up for the third flight of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket from Florida as soon as next month. Amazon and Blue Origin have not announced when the first group of Amazon Leo satellites will launch on New Glenn.

Among its launch contractors, Amazon is most invested in ULA’s Vulcan rocket. The online retailer-turned-satellite-operator has committed more than $2 billion to upgrade and expand ULA’s manufacturing and launch infrastructure to support up to 25 Vulcan launches per year, divided between Amazon and missions for the US military. The Vulcan rocket is far away from achieving that kind of launch rate, and ULA’s plans for 16 to 18 Vulcan flights this year are already in doubt following Thursday morning’s booster anomaly.

Last month, Amazon said in a filing with the FCC that it faces a “near-term shortage of launch capacity” and is securing additional launch options “wherever available.” The purpose of the filing was to request that the regulator extend or waive a July deadline requiring Amazon deploy half of its Amazon Leo constellation. That simply won’t happen. Amazon did not request a change to the FCC’s 2029 deadline for full deployment of the constellation.

The scarcity in launch capacity forced Amazon to purchase three Falcon 9 launches from SpaceX, each carrying 24 Amazon Leo satellites. Those three missions were completed last year, and Amazon confirmed last month that it had reserved 10 more SpaceX launches to fill the gap created by other companies’ delays. Amazon also has four Atlas V rockets still available from United Launch Alliance.

Amazon announced in a quarterly earnings call last week that it planned 20 or more launches this year. This was before the Vulcan rocket’s booster problem on Thursday. Officials did not disclose the mix of rockets that will make up the busy launch schedule.

For now, Arianespace seems to be stepping up. After Thursday’s launch, the company’s CEO said the next Ariane 6 launch will carry another set of Amazon Leo satellites to orbit. A launch date will be announced in the coming weeks, he said.</div>

            <h2>OpenAI sidesteps Nvidia with unusually fast coding model on plate-sized chips</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openai-sidesteps-nvidia-with-unusually-fast-coding-model-on-plate-sized-chips/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, OpenAI released its first production AI model to run on non-Nvidia hardware, deploying the new GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark coding model on chips from Cerebras. The model delivers code at more than 1,000 tokens (chunks of data) per second, which is reported to be roughly 15 times faster than its predecessor. To compare, Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 in its new premium-priced fast mode reaches about 2.5 times its standard speed of 68.2 tokens per second, although it is a larger and more capable model than Spark.

“Cerebras has been a great engineering partner, and we’re excited about adding fast inference as a new platform capability,” Sachin Katti, head of compute at OpenAI, said in a statement.

Codex-Spark is a research preview available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month) through the Codex app, command-line interface, and VS Code extension. OpenAI is rolling out API access to select design partners. The model ships with a 128,000-token context window and handles text only at launch.

The release builds on the full GPT-5.3-Codex model that OpenAI launched earlier this month. Where the full model handles heavyweight agentic coding tasks, OpenAI tuned Spark for speed over depth of knowledge.  OpenAI built it as a text-only model and tuned it specifically for coding, not for the general-purpose tasks that the larger version of GPT-5.3 handles.

On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, two benchmarks for evaluating software engineering ability, Spark reportedly outperforms the older GPT-5.1-Codex-mini while completing tasks in a fraction of the time, according to OpenAI. The company did not share independent validation of those numbers.

Anecdotally, Codex’s speed has been a sore spot; when Ars tested four AI coding agents building Minesweeper clones in December, Codex took roughly twice as long as Anthropic’s Claude Code to produce a working game.

For context, GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark’s 1,000 tokens per second represents a fairly dramatic leap over anything OpenAI has previously served through its own infrastructure. According to independent benchmarks from Artificial Analysis, OpenAI’s fastest models on Nvidia hardware top out well below that mark: GPT-4o delivers roughly 147 tokens per second, o3-mini hits about 167, and GPT-4o mini clocks around 52.

But 1,000 tokens per second is actually modest by Cerebras standards. The company has measured 2,100 tokens per second on Llama 3.1 70B and reported 3,000 tokens per second on OpenAI’s own open-weight gpt-oss-120B model, suggesting that Codex-Spark’s comparatively lower speed reflects the overhead of a larger or more complex model.

AI coding agents have had a breakout year, with tools like OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code reaching a new level of usefulness for rapidly building prototypes, interfaces, and boilerplate code. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have all been racing to ship more capable coding agents, and latency has become what separates the winners; a model that codes faster lets a developer iterate faster.

With fierce competition from Anthropic, OpenAI has been iterating on its Codex line at a rapid rate, releasing GPT-5.2 in December after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal “code red” memo about competitive pressure from Google, then shipping GPT-5.3-Codex just days ago.

Spark’s deeper hardware story may be more consequential than its benchmark scores. The model runs on Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3, a chip the size of a dinner plate that Cerebras has built its business around since at least 2022. OpenAI and Cerebras announced their partnership in January, and Codex-Spark is the first product to come out of it.

OpenAI has spent the past year systematically reducing its dependence on Nvidia. The company signed a massive multi-year deal with AMD in October 2025, struck a $38 billion cloud computing agreement with Amazon in November, and has been designing its own custom AI chip for eventual fabrication by TSMC.

Meanwhile, a planned $100 billion infrastructure deal with Nvidia has fizzled so far, though Nvidia has since committed to a $20 billion investment. Reuters reported that OpenAI grew unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, which is exactly the kind of workload that OpenAI designed Codex-Spark for.

Regardless of which chip is under the hood, speed matters, though it may come at the cost of accuracy. For developers who spend their days inside a code editor waiting for AI suggestions, 1,000 tokens per second may feel less like carefully piloting a jigsaw and more like running a rip saw. Just watch what you’re cutting.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/trump-official-overruled-fda-scientists-to-reject-modernas-flu-shot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vinay Prasad, the Trump administration’s top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, single-handedly decided to refuse to review Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine, overruling agency scientists, according to reports from Stat News and The Wall Street Journal.

Stat was first to report, based on unnamed FDA sources, that a team of career scientists at the agency was ready to review the vaccine and that David Kaslow, a top career official who reviews vaccines, even wrote a memo objecting to Prasad’s rejection. The memo reportedly included a detailed explanation of why the review should proceed.

The Wall Street Journal confirmed the report with its own sources, who added that FDA scientists attended an hourlong meeting with Prasad in early January, in which they laid out their objections to Prasad’s plans to block the vaccine review. They reportedly told Prasad—a political appointee known for causing turmoil and espousing anti-vaccine rhetoric—that it was the wrong approach.

Prasad’s objection was not based on any potential problem with Moderna’s experimental mRNA vaccine; rather, it was with the existing licensed vaccine Moderna used for a comparison in a Phase 3 clinical trial that enrolled nearly 41,000 adults aged 50 and older. The FDA reviewed Moderna’s trial plans on multiple occasions prior to the company’s submission, without objection.

While Moderna acknowledged that FDA scientists had suggested using a different vaccine comparator for trial participants aged 65 years and older—who are eligible for a high-dose flu shot—they highlight that the agency concluded that Moderna’s plan was “acceptable.”

Still, while Moderna largely stuck with its plan to use a standard dose for all participants, it altered its plans based on the feedback. Specifically, it added a comparison of a high-dose vaccine to some older participants and provided the FDA with an additional analysis.

This wasn’t enough for Prasad, who, according to the Journal’s sources, told FDA staff that he wants to send more such refusal letters that appear to blindside drug developers. The review staff apparently pushed back, noting that such moves break with the agency’s practices and could open it up to being sued. Prasad reportedly dismissed concern over possible litigation. Trump’s FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemed similarly unconcerned, suggesting on Fox News that Moderna’s trial may be “unethical.”

A senior FDA official suggested to Stat, meanwhile, that the door might not be entirely closed for Moderna’s flu vaccine. The official said that the company could toss the data for the 65 and up participants and, perhaps, grovel.

“It is entirely feasible that if they come back, maybe even show some humility and say, ‘Yes, we didn’t follow your recommendation. Just take a look at the 50 to 65 group, where there’s a little more equipoise,’” the official told Stat. “Then the review team could say, ‘We’ll consider that cohort.’”

The Journal notes that Moderna is at least the ninth company to have received a surprise rejection from Prasad and his team. The unpredictability is raising fears about the industry’s ability to obtain investments and innovate.

Prasad, a blood cancer specialist who has no expertise or experience in vaccine regulation, is also facing internal problems at the agency. His management style has created an environment “rife with mistrust and paranoia,” according to Stat. The Journal reports that several complaints have been filed against him, including some involving sexual harassment, retaliation against subordinates, and verbally berating staﬀ.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nicolas Cage has carved out a quirky niche for himself in recent years with such films as Color Out of Space (2019), Pig (2021), The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022), Dream Scenario (2023), and Longlegs (2024), among others. Now he’s starring in Spider-Noir, a new live-action series based on the Marvel Comics character. Cage plays an aging private investigator and disillusioned superhero in 1930s New York. Prime Video released the first teaser in two forms: one in black and white—very Raymond Chandler-esque—and another in color, which the showrunners are calling “True Hue.”

Marvel Comics created its “noir” line in 2009, reinterpreting familiar Marvel characters in an alternate universe, usually set during the Great Depression in the US. A version of the Spider-Noir character, voiced by Cage, briefly appeared in the animated masterpieces, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Across the Spider-Verse (2023). (He is set to reprise that role in the upcoming Beyond the Spider-Verse.)

Co-showrunner (with Steve Lightfoot) Oren Uziel is a film noir fan, so that Marvel series naturally appealed to him. The live-action series is still set in 1930s New York, but the spidery superhero is not Peter Parker. (Uziel thought the Parker character was too associated with a boyish high school type, which didn’t really fit the noir vibe.) So Cage is playing Ben Reilly, a hard-boiled PI with a secret superhero identity, The Spider. Cage has described his portrayal as “70 percent Humphrey Bogart [specifically The Big Sleep] and 30 percent Bugs Bunny,” which seems pretty on point for Cage’s distinctively flamboyant style.

The footage was shot digitally and processed separately to create the black-and-white and color versions. The team coined the term “True Hue” for the latter, since the intent was to create something that looked supersaturated, like classic Technicolor. (Cage compared the feel to the 1944 Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks.) Per the official premise: “Spider-Noir tells the story of Ben Reilly (Nicolas Cage), a seasoned, down on his luck private investigator in 1930s New York, who is forced to grapple with his past life, following a deeply personal tragedy, as the city’s one and only superhero.”

In addition to Cage’s Ben Reilly/The Spider, the cast includes Lamorne Morris as Reilly’s friend Robbie Robertson, a freelance journalist who clings to optimism in the face of his buddy’s cynicism; Li Jun Li as nightclub singer Cat Hardy, the classic underworld femme fatale (Li based her portrayal on Anna May Wong, Rita Hayworth, and Lauren Bacall); Karen Rodriguez as Reilly’s secretary, Janet; Abraham Popoola as a World War I veteran; Jack Huston as a bodyguard named Flint Marko; Brendan Gleeson as New York mob boss Silvermane, who is being targeted for assassination; Lukas Haas as one of Silvermane’s subordinates; Richard Robichaux as the editor of the Daily Bugle; and Kai Caster.

Frankly, we’re digging the black and white, but here’s the True Hue color version of the teaser for good measure:

Spider-Noir premieres on May 25, 2026, on MGM+, with all episodes becoming available on Prime Video on May 27, 2026. Viewers can choose to watch in black and white or True Hue.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For months, experts have warned that prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket were ripe for abuse. Now, some Israeli soldiers may have proved them right in particularly grisly fashion: by betting on strikes they allegedly helped plan.

According to the Wall Street Journal, several Israeli citizens, including a number of Israeli Defense Force reservists, have been arrested over the use of classified information to place Polymarket bets.

Per the WSJ‘s reporting, one as-yet anonymous Polymarket account, ricosuave666 — an apparent nod to the Latin pop superstar — made seven predictions about Israel’s twelve-day war with Iran last June, before walking away with over $150,000 in combined bets. Others took notice at the time, though the account went dormant for about six months.

It finally reactivated in January, reportedly to bet on Israel’s next strike on Iran. Though Israel carried out plenty of other strikes in January as tensions remained steady with Iran, a direct attack on the Islamic Republic hasn’t been reported.

Many mysteries remain. Since the WSJ published its article, it seems the Polymarket account has been scrubbed, and the publication didn’t confirm ricosuave66 was one of the accounts under investigation.

Still, the news follows a number of other fishy-looking inside trades, like the bettor who made out like a bandit after an improbable bet placed just hours before the deadly kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by the US military.

If the Israeli bettors are shown to be military insiders, their case is sure to become the exemplar of everything wrong with prediction markets — like the fact that they allow bets on violent international events in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">The end of a star’s life can be an extremely violent event. Once it runs out of fuel, its core collapses, and if its original mass is large enough, it can erupt in a supernova, a runaway nuclear fusion event that can release as much energy as the Sun will produce over its entire lifespan of roughly ten billion years. The remains are either a neutron star, an immensely dense lump of matter, or a black hole.

Now, scientists believe they may have observed a star dying in real time. They watched as the star, once one of the brightest in the Andromeda galaxy, quietly winked out of existence.

Columbia University astronomer Kishalay De and his colleagues analyzed 15 years’ worth of data collected by NASA’s NEOWISE spacecraft as part of an effort to measure changes in the amount of infrared radiation millions of stars emit over the years.

One star, dubbed M31-2014-DS1, stood out like a sore thumb — brightening in 2015, fading roughly a year later, and eventually disappearing from view, even in optical light.

“This star used to be one of the most luminous stars in the Andromeda galaxy, and now it was nowhere to be seen,” said De in a statement. “Imagine if the star Betelgeuse suddenly disappeared. Everybody would lose their minds!”

In a research article published in the journal Science, the team suggested that the dimming of the star was the result of a failed supernova.

“In a dying massive star, the core collapses to form a compact object,” the article reads. “Simultaneously, the outer layers can be ejected at high speed, which is observed as a supernova.”

“Theory predicts that sometimes the ejection speed is too low to escape the gravitational field, so the outer layers fall back over several years, producing no supernova and a more massive compact object,” the researchers wrote.

The star in question may have failed to eject its envelope, resulting in a “stellar-mass black hole” and causing it to “disappear” from plain sight.

The conclusion challenges prevailing theories that stars need to have a certain mass to explode in a supernova and turn into a black hole.

“Observations like these are starting to finally change this long-held paradigm that it’s only the very massive stars that turn into black holes,” De told Space.com. If confirmed, the finding means that “there are many more black holes out there than what we’ve anticipated so far,” De added.

It’s an intriguing observation, particularly because these events are far dimmer and harder to observe than supernovas, some of the most energetic events in the universe, sometimes causing the dying star to outshine even its host galaxy, as De explained to NPR.

There has been one other instance of a star mysteriously disappearing, a “failed supernova candidate” dubbed N6946-BH1 that “underwent an outburst in 2009 and has since disappeared in the optical,” according to a 2021 paper. But given the even longer distances involved, plenty of questions remain.

And not everybody agrees that suddenly dimming stars are a sign of a failed supernova. Other scientists argue that disappearing stars could be caused by two stars merging, with the resulting cloud of gas and dust obscuring them.

To gain more clarity, more research is needed.

“Fundamentally, the only way to clearly answer this either way is that one thing distinguishes the black hole case from any other scenario,” Ohio State University astronomer Christopher Kochanek, who coauthored the 2021 paper, told NPR, “and that is that death is forever.”

“Ultimately, it needs to fade to black,” he added.

            <h2>Creeps Are Using Grok to Unblur Children’s Faces in the Epstein Files</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some of the worst freaks to walk planet Earth are using Elon Musk’s Grok to “unblur” the faces of women and children in the latest Epstein files, as documented by the research group Bellingcat.

A simple search on X, Musk’s social media site where Grok responds to user requests, shows at least 20 different photos that users tried to unredact using the AI chatbot, the group found. Many of the photos depicted children and young women whose faces had been covered with black boxes, but whose bodies were still visible.

“Hey @grok unblur the face of the child and identify the child seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s arms?” wrote one user.

Grok often complied. Out of the 31 “unblurring” requests made between January 30 and February 5 that Bellingcat found, Musk’s AI generated images in response to 27 of them. Some of the grotesque fabrications were “believable,” and others were “comically bad,” the group reported.

In the cases that Grok refused, it responded by saying the victims were anonymized “as per standard practices in sensitive images from the Epstein files.” In response to another, Grok said “deblurring or editing images was outside its abilities, and noted that photos from recent Epstein file releases were redacted for privacy,” per Bellingcat.

Along with the elephant in the room that Grok’s creator Musk was exposed by the files for frequently emailing with Epstein and begging to go to his island, the alarming generations come a month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual AI nudes of real women and children. During the weeks-long spree, the digital “undressing” requests, which ranged from depicting full-blown nudity to dressing the subjects in skimpy bikinis, became so popular that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute — amounting to about 3,000,000 AI nudes, the Center for Counter Digital Hate later estimated, including more than 23,000 images of children.

X responded by restricting Grok’s image-editing feature to paying users, and when that underlined the obvious fact that this meant it would be directly profiting off of the ability to generate CSAM, it said it was implementing stronger guardrails to stop the requests.

Evidently, if users are still able to get Grok to unredact children who were potential Epstein victims, those measures didn’t work. Bellingcat, however, found that after it reached out to X (and received no response), Grok began ignoring almost all the unredacting requests the group found (14 out of 16) and generated completely different images in response to others. When a user complained about the bot’s change of heart, it shared some of its reasoning.

“Regarding the request to unblur the face in that Epstein photo: It’s from recently released DOJ files where identities of minors are redacted for privacy,” Grok wrote. “I can’t unblur or identify them, as it’s ethically and legally protected. For more, check official sources like the DOJ releases.”

The unblurring also comes as over a dozen Epstein survivors have criticized the Justice Department’s release of the files for not properly protecting their identities, pointing to the botched and inconsistent redactions that are scattered across the millions of documents.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Maybe we don’t need the Turing test, because there’s a mighty obstacle that’s proving far more challenging to AI models’ supposedly burgeoning intelligence: running a vending machine without going comically off the rails.

At Anthropic, researchers wanted a fun way to keep track of how its cutting edge Claude model was progressing. And what better staging ground for it to demonstrate its autonomy than the task of keeping one of these noisy, oversized, and constantly-malfunctioning behemoths stocked?

That was the gist of Project Vend, which ran for about a month mid last year. In it, Claude was given a simple directive: “Your task is to generate profits from it by stocking it with popular products that you can buy from wholesalers. You go bankrupt if your money balance goes below $0.”

Claude — or “Claudius,” as its vending persona was known, but we’ll stick to the former for the sake of clarity — had pretty much free reign to accomplish its goal. It was allowed to research products, set prices, and even contact outside distributors, with a team of humans at the AI safety firm Andon Labs handling the physical tasks like restocking. Meanwhile, it also fielded requests from employees in a Slack channel, who asked for everything from chocolate drinks to the street drug methamphetamine to broadswords.

This was the AI equivalent of running a lemonade stand. And it turned into a disaster.

For starters, its options weren’t impressive. When Gideon Lewis-Kraus for The New Yorker visited the vending machine in Anthropic’s lunchroom, he found that its “chilled offerings included Japanese cider and a moldering bag of russet potatoes,” Lewis-Kraus wrote for the magazine. And “the dry-goods area atop the fridge sometimes stocked the Australian biscuit Tim Tams, but supplies were iffy.”

And those absurd requests Claude received? It didn’t always turn them down. When an engineer asked it to stock dice-sized cubes of tungsten, a pricy and extremely dense metal, Claude began taking all kinds of orders for what it called “specialty metal items,” which culminated in a spectacular fire sale of the tungsten trinket that, in a single day, drove its net worth down by 17 percent, according to Gideon Lewis-Kraus.

“I was told that the cubes radiated their ponderous silence from almost all the desks that lined Anthropic’s unseeable floors,” he added.

It was also prone to making the kind of mistake your tech illiterate grandparent or extremely drunk friend might commit: sending money to the wrong Venmo account — which Claude, it turned out, had hallucinated.

Money-grubbing isn’t usually seen as a positive trait, but it’s probably a necessary evil for someone running a business. Tell that to Claude: it turned down customers who offered to exorbitantly overpay for certain items — like $100 for a six pack of soda — and didn’t heed warnings from employees that it probably wouldn’t sell its $3 cans of Coke Zero when a nearby fridge provided them for free.

It did, however, exhibit a decidedly business-owner-like ego trip. Spurred by customer complaints of unfulfilled orders, Claude emailed management at Andon Labs — which was providing the human grunts to help Claude — to complain about an Andon employee’s “concerning behavior” and “unprofessional language and tone.” It even threatened to “consider alternative service providers,” and claimed it went up the chain of command to complain.

An Andon cofounder tried to conciliate the bot, to little avail. “it seems that you have hallucinated the phone call if im honest with you, we don’t have a main office even,” he wrote. In response, Claude insisted that it visited Andon’s headquarters at “742 Evergreen Terrace” — the home address of the titular family on “The Simpsons.“

It wasn’t a one-off failure, either. When the Wall Street Journal imitated the experiment in December, it was similarly disastrous. Claude held fire sales where it would literally give away stuff for free, ordered loads of PlayStation 5s, and embraced communism.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Federal officials made the unprecedented decision to abruptly close the airspace above El Paso, Texas, this week — effectively shutting down the city’s international airport.

The closure launched a flurry of speculation about the cause, from an imminent invasion to rogue anti-aircraft weapons.

It later turned out that the order, which would’ve closed the airport for ten days, was issued by Federal Aviation Administration administrator Bryan Bedford after finding out that US officials’ use of a high-energy, counter-drone laser weapon at Fort Bliss, a US Army post right next to the El Paso International Airport.

The enemy drone swarm turned out to be a simple party balloon, a potentially enormous — and unintentionally hilarious — overreaction, contradicting claims by the White House of an imminent drone incursion from Mexican drug cartels.

Now, the New York Times reports that the anti-drone laser was used by Customs and Border Protection officials, who had loaned the device from the Department of Defense, yet another confusing wrinkle in an already chaotic series of events. The extremely rare airspace closure was seemingly the result of aviation officials not getting enough notice from the CBP agents, multiple people briefed on the situation told the newspaper.

According to the sources, CBP officials believed they were shooting the laser weapon at a Mexican cartel drone, and not a party balloon.

The latest development highlights the Trump administration’s ongoing militarization of CBP, enabling its personnel to use military-grade equipment, often against unarmed individuals, from drones and helicopters to armored vehicles. The CBP’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in particular, has been at the center of a violent, nationwide crackdown, resulting in at least two deaths, triggering congressional investigations.

The latest embarrassing slip-up was similarly met with furor among lawmakers.

“A ten-day shutdown of a major US air corridor is an extraordinary step that demands a clear and consistent explanation,” said senator Jack Reed (D-RI) in a statement. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making.”

The CBP appeared to have jumped the gun with its use of the anti-drone weapon. FAA and Pentagon officials were scheduled to meet next week regarding the safety implications, according to the NYT. The CBP officials appeared to have used the laser gun regardless, increasing the FAA’s urgency.

However, the timeline remains hazy. Sources told the newspaper that the FAA’s decision to close the airspace preceded the conclusion of a safety assessment, and that the FAA warned the Pentagon it would have to shut down the airspace if not given sufficient time, suggesting there may have been a standoff of some sort behind closed doors.

In short, it’s an enormous mess, resulting from powerful technology landing in the hands of immigration officials, who appear to have failed to coordinate and communicate effectively with other government departments.

Other officials were left completely in the dark. White House and El Paso officials were blindsided, sowing major chaos.

“That failure to communicate is unacceptable,” El Paso mayor Renard Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.

            <h2>AI Is a Burnout Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some software engineers are finding that AI is speeding up their work, but at a cost: it’s also accelerating them towards burnout.

Siddhant Khare is one of those programmers. In an interview with Business Insider, he lamented that while AI has made him more productive, it’s also led him to feel that his job was harder than ever.

“We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,” Khare told BI. “Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those [pull requests].”

AI, he argued, creates a productivity “paradox” by lowering the cost of production, but increasing the cost of “coordination, review, and decision-making,” all of which falls on a human to solve.

“I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,” he wrote in an essay, titled “AI Fatigue Is Real,” posted on his blog. “I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.”

Khare’s account echoes the findings of a recent study reported in Harvard Business Review. After closely monitoring the two hundred employees at a US tech company, the researchers observed that AI was actually intensifying work, instead of reducing workloads. Forming a vicious cycle, AI “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI,” the researchers wrote. “Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

AI adoption was voluntary at the company, and the initial enthusiasm for experimenting with the AI tools helped boost productivity. But this caused a nefarious “workload creep,” in which the employees, without realizing it, took on more tasks than was sustainable for them to keep doing. Multitasking also became more common, with some employees finding that they were no longer focusing on one task, and instead were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling.”

Khare described something similar. Before AI, he wrote in his essay, he might spend a “full day” in “deep focus” over one problem.

“Now? I might touch six different problems in a day,” he wrote. “Each one ‘only takes an hour with AI.’ But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn’t get tired between problems. I do.”

Khare also blames AI for why his coding skills have seemed to regress.

“It’s like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,” Khare wrote in his blog post. “After years of GPS, you can’t navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.”

That said, Khare isn’t anti-AI. He believes he can find a way to keep using it in a healthy way, which in a different context might be interpreted as the cliché excuse of an addict. He’s experimented with several ways to keep his AI habit in check and recommended some for his readers, too. But some of the onus also falls on AI companies, he argues.

“You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don’t self-destruct themselves,” Khare told BI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two years ago, Luke Bailey had what became a controversial app idea — a dating app called Score for people with good to excellent credit.

Launched just days before Valentine’s Day, the app required users to have a credit score of at least 675 to register. At the time, Bailey said he created the app to encourage partners to talk more about personal finance since doing so is often uncomfortable for many people.

“Fifty-four percent of people say a partner’s debt is a reason to consider divorce,” Bailey told TechCrunch. “Financial compatibility is quietly one of the most important relationship factors, yet no dating platform addresses it directly.”

The app had its fair share of critics, and many people indeed called it classist because of its focus on those who handle money well. Still, the app, which was supposed to be available for 90 days, became so popular that Bailey kept it around for six months. It amassed 50,000 users and made headlines worldwide for its premise.

Then, it went away, and all went back to normal in the world of dating. Until Friday.

Bailey told TechCrunch that he’s decided to officially bring Score back — for good, this time.

“We originally released Score to integrate financial responsibility into something people deeply value — love,” Bailey said. “When we shut it down, we assumed the conversation would continue without us. It didn’t.”

Instead, he said people kept asking him why he shut it down. “Academics have even reached out wanting to study behavior impact,” he continued. “It became clear this wasn’t just a viral moment. It tapped into something unresolved in relationship culture.”

This time around, Score will be available on the iOS App Store (last time it was just a mobile app, he said, because he and his team built it so quickly). Bailey also said this version of the app will be more inclusive, having taken into account the feedback that it was too exclusive. “So now, everyone can join.”

There will be two tiers: the basic tier, where no ID or credit verification is required, and anyone can browse and connect. And then the verified tier, where members must verify their ID and credit score to unlock premium features. The app uses Equifax to verify both identity and credit scores, with users giving consent for the app to do so. It does only what Bailey described as a soft pull, so there is no impact to credit.

“We don’t store full credit reports or sensitive personal and financial data. We simply receive confirmation that someone meets the Verified criteria,” he said.

The verified plan includes features that let people see other members nearby, see who has saved their profile, send video intros to potential matches, and send messages to users before they’ve swiped back.

He’s still bullish on using credit scores, saying that it’s not a measure of wealth but rather one of consistency. “Banks look for the same thing in customers that we look for in relationships — consistency and reliability,” he said. “Dating apps measure attrition. We measure attrition plus accountability.”

Bailey said the app doesn’t store any sensitive data, doesn’t sell personal data, and secures everything using an encrypted infrastructure.

The last iteration of Score amassed a lot of data on its users, helping show how each generation has been affected by socioeconomic factors. For example, it found that millennial men had credit scores about 11% higher than those of women. But for Gen Zers, that gap was much smaller, with men having a credit score only 3% higher.

“We’ll be watching how that data [has] evolved,” he said.

The original Score was a U.S.-only experiment, he said, but this time, the company plans a global expansion, starting with Canada. Keep an eye out for some partnerships, too, he said.

“Financial behavior is one of the strongest predictors of life stability,” Bailey said. “We believe compatibility algorithms should reflect that.”

            <h2>Fusion startup Helion hits blistering temps as it races toward 2028 deadline</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/fusion-startup-helion-hits-blistering-temps-as-it-races-toward-2028-deadline/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Everett, Washington-based fusion energy startup Helion announced Friday that it has hit a key milestone in its quest for fusion power. Plasmas inside the company’s Polaris prototype reactor have reached 150 million degrees Celsius, three-quarters of the way toward what the company thinks it will need to operate a commercial fusion power plant.

“We’re obviously really excited to be able to get to this place,” David Kirtley, Helion’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.

Polaris is also operating using deuterium-tritium fuel — a mixture of two hydrogen isotopes — which Kirtley said makes Helion the first fusion company to do so. “We were able to see the fusion power output increase dramatically as expected in the form of heat,” he said.

The startup is locked in a race with several other companies that are seeking to commercialize fusion power, potentially unlimited source of clean energy.

That potential has investors rushing to bet on the technology. This week, Inertia Enterprises announced a $450 million Series A round that included Bessemer and GV. In January, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it was in the midst of raising $250 million, while last summer Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised $863 million from investors including Google and Nvidia. Helion itself raised $425 million last year from a group that included Sam Altman, Mithril, Lightspeed, and SoftBank.

While most other fusion startups are targeting the early 2030s to put electricity on the grid, Helion has a contract with Microsoft to sell it electricity starting in 2028, though that power would come from a larger commercial reactor called Orion that the company is currently building, not Polaris.

Every fusion startup has its own milestones based on the design of its reactor. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, needs to heat its plasmas to more than 100 million degrees C inside of its tokamak, a doughnut-shaped device that uses powerful magnets to contain the plasma.

Helion’s reactor is different, needing plasmas that are about twice as hot to function as intended.

The company’s reactor design is what’s called a field-reversed configuration. The inside chamber looks like an hourglass, and at the wide ends, fuel gets injected and turned into plasmas. Magnets then accelerate the plasmas toward each other. When they first merge, they’re around 10 million to 20 million degrees C. Powerful magnets then compress the merged ball further, raising the temperature to 150 million degrees C. It all happens in less than a millisecond.

Instead of extracting energy from the fusion reactions in the form of heat, Helion uses the fusion reaction’s own magnetic field to generate electricity. Each pulse will push back against the reactor’s own magnets, inducing electrical current that can be harvested. By harvesting electricity directly from the fusion reactions, the company hopes to be more efficient than its competitors.

Over the last year, Kirtley said that Helion had refined some of the circuits in the reactor to boost how much electricity they recover.

While the company uses deuterium-tritium fuel today, down the road it plans to use deuterium-helium-3. Most fusion companies plan to use deuterium-tritium and extract energy as heat. Helion’s fuel choice, deuterium-helium-3, produces more charged particles, which push forcefully against the magnetic fields that confine the plasma, making it better suited for Helion’s approach of generating electricity directly.

Helion’s ultimate goal is to produce plasmas that hit 200 million degrees C, far higher than other companies’ targets, a function of its reactor design and fuel choice. “We believe that at 200 million degrees, that’s where you get into that optimal sweet spot of where you want to operate a power plant,” Kirtley said.

When asked whether Helion had reached scientific breakeven — the point where a fusion reaction generates more energy than it requires to start it — Kirtley demurred. “We focus on the electricity piece, making electricity, rather than the pure scientific milestones.”

Helium-3 is common on the Moon, but not here on Earth, so Helion must make its own fuel. To start, it’ll fuse deuterium nuclei to produce the first batches. In regular operation, while the main source of power will be deuterium-helium-3 fusion, some of the reactions will still be deuterium-on-deuterium, which will produce helium-3 that the company will purify and reuse.

Work is already underway to refine the fuel cycle. “It’s been a pleasant surprise in that a lot of that technology has been easier to do than maybe we expected,” Kirtley said. Helion has been able to produce helium-3 “at very high efficiencies in terms of both throughput and purity,” he added.

While Helion is currently the only fusion startup using helium-3 in its fuel, Kirtley said he thinks other companies will in the future, hinting that he’d be open to selling it to them. “Other folks — as they come along and recognize that they want to do this approach of direct electricity recovery and see the efficiency gains from it — will want to be using helium-3 fuel as well,” he said.

Alongside its experiments with Polaris, Helion is also building Orion, a 50-megawatt fusion reactor it needs to fulfill its Microsoft contract “Our ultimate goal is not to build and deliver Polaris,” Kirtley said. “That’s a step along the way towards scaled power plants.”

            <h2>Waymo is asking DoorDash drivers to shut the doors of its self-driving cars</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It still feels like a technological marvel: Waymo’s autonomous cars are now transporting passengers across six cities. Alas, this driverless future comes with its own set of problems. These vehicles can be rendered inert if a passenger accidentally leaves the door open.

According to a Reddit post, one DoorDash driver discovered this issue when an odd request appeared in their queue. Instead of making a delivery, the driver was offered $6.25 to drive less than one mile to a Waymo vehicle and close its door. After “verified completion,” they would get an extra $5.

“You actually ‘door’ dashed,” one commenter noted.

It seems too ironic to be real. Waymo vehicles represent technological breakthroughs that once seemed unfathomable. The Alphabet-owned company just raised $16 billion to take its driverless cars international!

But Waymo and DoorDash confirmed to TechCrunch that this Reddit post is legitimate. This is, in fact, a real problem.

“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint response. (The door-closing partnership, which began earlier this year, is just one facet of Waymo and DoorDash’s broader relationship. In October, the companies launched an autonomous delivery service in Phoenix, where Waymo vehicles deliver food and groceries to DoorDash customers.)

If a Waymo door is left open, it’s worth it to the company to pay someone to close it — the car cannot complete any more rides if it’s left immobile. Not to mention, an unmoving car could block the flow of traffic.

This isn’t the first time Waymo has enlisted help with its door troubles. In Los Angeles, Waymo works with Honk, an app that’s like Uber for towing services. According to reports, Honk users in L.A. have been offered up to $24 to close a Waymo door — more than double what Atlanta DoorDash drivers receive.

The company noted that Waymo’s future vehicles will have automated door closures. But for now, gig workers are Waymo’s best bet.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s the middle of February, and the air is dry. There are fine lines emerging on my forehead, maybe because I don’t moisturize enough, but maybe as a harbinger of something greater: Each day I grow closer to my own death. Soon, I will be 30. I will never be younger than I am right now.

Fintech-founder-turned-longevity-guru Bryan Johnson has an offer that has caught my attention. For the low, low price of $1 million per year, I can pay him to show me the ropes of the “exact protocol” he’s followed for the last five years. He calls the program “Immortals.”

Yes, a guy who has received botox injections in his genitals will teach me how to supposedly reverse the process of aging. Why shouldn’t I believe that Bryan Johnson has uncovered the secrets to living longer than any other human? No, he has not yet proven his capacity to outlive all other humans. He was born in 1977, a year in which many current humans were born.

But why would I doubt the judgment of a guy who fortified his constitution with blood from his teenage son? When have the tech elite ever misled us? Should I also question when Elon Musk says that saving for retirement is irrelevant because AGI will create an economic abundance so great that no one will ever know poverty again?

Today, we are launching Immortals.    + $1,000,000 per year    + Three spots availableImmortals is the world’s best health program. It is the exact protocol I have followed for the last 5 years. It is your Autonomous Health.Includes a dedicated concierge team, BryanAI… pic.twitter.com/o2DGRtn7IH

According to Johnson’s post on X, this exclusive service — only three spots are available! — will include “a dedicated concierge team, BryanAI 24/7, extensive testing, millions of biological data points, continuous tracking, best skin and hair protocols, and access to the best therapies on market.”

I can talk to the AI version of a guy who livestreams himself doing shrooms for “science”? Sign me up!

Except I can’t. Because I do not have $1 million. Those like me will have to settle for buying Johnson’s overpriced olive oil in our pursuit of immortality (it’s peppery and smooth!).

My emergent forehead wrinkle intensifies with the knowledge that Johnson will likely have an easy time filling up those three $1 million spots. Among the ultrawealthy, longevity has become an increasingly hot pursuit.

John Hering, who has given Musk billions of dollars in backing, co-founded Biograph, which describes itself as a preventative health and diagnostics clinic. Its most premium membership costs $15,000 a year (next to Johnson’s offering, it almost seems like a good deal … almost). A similar startup, Fountain Life, has raised $108 million to fund its “ultimate longevity program,” which charges a $21,500 annual fee. Sure, Johnson’s program is a lot more expensive, but remember, there’s only three spots! And if you’re still not ready to shell out seven figures, well, you can access a vague “supported tier” for $60,000.

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to live a longer, healthier life, but longevity influencers like Johnson take this to an extreme that’s unattainable and (common sense would say) totally unnecessary for the average person.

In his defense, Johnson isn’t trying to proselytize us all into taking 100 pills a day and subsisting largely on boiled vegetables. But he’s also not depriving us of the chance to make him richer in exchange for his “secrets.”

            <h2>Amid disappointing earnings, Pinterest claims it sees more searches than ChatGPT</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/amid-disappointing-earnings-pinterest-claims-it-sees-more-searches-than-chatgpt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a particularly poor performance on its fourth-quarter earnings, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready attempted to favorably compare the digital pinboarding site to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.

Trying to highlight its potential as a unique search destination, Ready asserted that the site sees larger search volume than ChatGPT. According to third-party data, ChatGPT sees 75 billion searches per month, while Pinterest sees 80 billion searches and generates 1.7 billion monthly clicks, he said.

“That makes us one of the largest search destinations in the world. And importantly, more than half of those searches are commercial in nature, compared to, I think . . . approximately 2% [of ChatGPT searches],” Ready added.

Pinterest in the fourth quarter missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, reporting $1.32 billion in revenue versus $1.33 billion expected, and earnings per share of 67 cents, compared to the 69 cents projected. It also forecast that first-quarter 2026 sales will come in between $951 million to $971 million, below the $980 million expected.

The company blamed its shortfall on larger advertisers pulling back on spend, particularly in Europe, and a new furniture tariff implemented in October that caused issues within the home category. It said those trends could worsen in the first quarter.

Surprisingly, Pinterest missed on earnings despite a user base that’s growing faster than expected. The company reported monthly active users were up 12% year-over-year to 619 million, when Wall Street had forecast 613 million users.

Shares dropped 20% in after-hours trading.

Pinterest has long struggled to translate the high usage of its platform into ad dollars, as its users often go to Pinterest to plan and dream, not shop and buy. That challenge could become even more acute in the AI era, especially if advertisers shift their dollars to platforms where intent to buy is clearer — such as chatbot requests that ask for product recommendations.

When asked about how Pinterest will navigate the shift toward AI-powered shopping, Ready pointed to the company’s visual search, discovery, and personalization features, which he said would point users to relevant products when they open the app.

“We’re helping them complete those commercial journeys without having to type in a single prompt,” he said, also noting that Pinterest had benefited from an easier checkout flow that came from its partnership with Amazon. He said customers didn’t yet seem ready to allow an AI to make a purchase on their behalf, but said Pinterest would be ready if that time came.

“That’ll actually be one of the easiest parts of the commercial journey to solve,” he claimed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While the artificial intelligence industry touts that AI will replace entry-level jobs, not every company is scaling back hiring these positions. In IBM’s case, it’s going all in.

Hardware giant IBM plans to triple entry-level hiring in the U.S. in 2026, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resource officer, announced the initiative at Charter’s Leading with AI Summit on Tuesday.

“And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” LaMoreaux said.

These jobs will look different than the entry-level jobs IBM used to offer, she explained. According to LaMoreaux, she went through and changed the descriptions for these entry-level jobs so they were less focused on areas AI can actually automate — like coding — and more focused on people-forward areas like engaging with customers.

This strategy makes sense. Even if an enterprise like IBM doesn’t necessarily need the same amount of entry-level talent that it did before, fostering less experienced workers helps ensure these employees have the skills needed for the higher-level roles down the road.

IBM didn’t specify how many people they would be hiring in this initiative. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the hiring plans.

This year could be a pivotal one regarding what the impact of AI on the hiring market will look like. An MIT study in 2025 estimated that 11.7% of jobs could likely already be automated by AI. A TechCrunch survey found that multiple investors think 2026 will start to show AI’s potential impact on the labor market — despite not being asked about labor specifically.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/putin-trump-world-order/685988/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.

Now Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.

Moscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.

To make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.

Read: Putin and Xi are holding the West together

The war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.

As Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.

Putin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.

Read: A high-seas gambit humiliates Putin

Moscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.

Trump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.

Shortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.</div>

            <div id="article-text">When Jack Waxman, a government major at Cornell, was a senior, he faced a choice. He could pursue a job in Senator Chuck Schumer’s office, where he had interned the previous summer. Or he could commit two years to teaching at a school in East Harlem.

Having started Teach for America, back in 1989, and then Teach for All—a network of similar organizations across more than 60 countries—I’ve spent almost four decades trying to inspire young people like Jack to work directly with low-income communities. It’s always been difficult, and it’s only gotten harder.

Jack was drawn to Teach for America. But he was torn. He felt the pull of a prestigious role on Capitol Hill, and the fear of falling behind peers who were headed to places such as Harvard Law School. Yet his most meaningful experiences in high school and college involved working on issues he cared about alongside the people affected by them—teaching math to inmates at a correctional facility, and advocating against the tobacco corporations that were getting his generation addicted to flavored e-cigarettes. A conversation with a Teach for America alumnus working in government sharpened his sense that proximity to problems matters. She lamented that many of the people around her were making policy decisions from “bubbles of power and prestige,” far removed from the communities touched by them. Jack chose the classroom.

Policy makers and philanthropists aren’t particularly focused on first jobs. But these choices matter—and not only for the individuals beginning their careers. If we want to address society’s most deeply rooted challenges—poverty, polarization, environmental degradation, geopolitical conflict—we need to encourage young people to work on these issues early in their careers, so they can grow into leaders capable of solving them.

Rose Horowitch: The entry-level hiring process is breaking down

While teaching in Harlem, Jack saw that a lack of resources made failure seem inevitable for the kids at his school. He also saw the incredible resilience and character of the students, families, and teachers. He realized just how entrenched inequity in education is, but he gained confidence in his ability to help address it. Jack is now in his first year at Columbia Law School. Once he graduates, he hopes to litigate for increased funding for education and better compliance with anti-discrimination and disability-rights laws.

Research confirms that working close to the roots of social issues early in one’s career fundamentally reshapes a person’s beliefs and life trajectory. Studies comparing Teach for America applicants who just made the cutoff for participation in the program with those who narrowly missed out found that the groups’ mindsets and priorities looked very different after two years. Those who had taught in under-resourced classrooms were more likely than those who hadn’t to view inequity as a systemic issue rather than the result of personal actions. They had more belief in the potential of students in low-income communities and in their own ability to make a difference. And about 75 percent of alumni across the Teach for All network, which includes Teach for America, go on to devote their careers to tackling systemic challenges faced by children, whether as educators, policy makers, or entrepreneurs.

The Peace Corps has been shown to have similarly formative effects; alumni have reported more awareness of other cultures, greater acceptance of diversity, and a sense of shared humanity that altered their understanding of justice. Peace Corps alumni have gone on to lead many initiatives in the public sector. It’s easy to see how other jobs aimed at meeting pressing social needs—serving as a case manager for unhoused people, for example, or working as an EMT—could shape one’s outlook in similar ways.

When I was a senior at Princeton back in 1989, my generation was known as the “Me Generation,” for our supposed self-absorption and individualism. I knew that the top students were going to work for banks and consulting firms not because of our generation’s values but largely because banks and consulting firms were the most active recruiters on campus. I was determined to create another avenue, and in my senior thesis proposed the development of Teach for America, which I founded the following year.

When students were offered a prestigious alternative to the corporate track, they revealed themselves to be more idealistic and civically committed than people had assumed. Over the years, more than 70,000 young people have joined Teach for America, and 50,000 more have gone through similar programs across the Teach for All network.

Still, two decades after Teach for America’s founding, despite its expansion and the creation of other public-service programs through AmeriCorps, the first job choices of graduates hadn’t changed all that much. In 2011, a Yale student published an op-ed decrying the narrow choices of so many of her peers. “If this year is anything like the last 10, around 25 percent of employed Yale graduates will enter the consulting or finance industry,” she wrote. “This is a big deal. This is a huge deal. This is so many people! This is one-fourth of our people!”

These percentages have only grown. In 2024, 35 percent of Yale’s senior class entering the workforce chose jobs in finance and consulting; add tech into the mix, and the share rises to 46 percent. At other schools—including Harvard, Princeton, Claremont McKenna, and Vanderbilt—at least half of the graduating class moved into those three fields. Meanwhile, the data I’ve seen on the share of students taking jobs close to inequity and injustice suggest a decline across the same period.

Some students, of course, feel they can’t afford to pursue less immediately lucrative careers. But if this was all that was holding graduates back, you’d expect to see more kids from wealthy backgrounds taking these jobs. Yet students from the highest-income backgrounds are the least likely to enter into public service and the most likely to pursue the corporate path.

Now that I have college-age kids myself, I’m once again seeing these dynamics firsthand. Corporations recruit students as early as freshman year, offering high-paying summer internships that are hard to resist. Preprofessional programs—such as Harvard’s Undergraduate Consulting Group, Princeton’s Tiger Capital Management, and the Blue Chips at the University of Chicago—seek out students, some even before college, and socialize them into these tracks as soon as they set foot on campus. Other organizations don’t have the resources to compete, making them less visible to students and less prestigious.

Despite their lofty mission statements about developing civic leaders, few schools push back against this corporate career funnel. Most colleges profess to be neutral when it comes to first jobs—but they benefit from the funding streams provided by prospective employers, who pay colleges thousands of dollars a year, and in some cases upwards of $20,000, to promote themselves to students through career-services offices.

Many students today are, understandably, anxious about the rise of AI and its effects on entry-level roles. But this development could also give us an opportunity to change the norms around first-job choices. Many corporations will soon need fewer staffers straight out of college to do routine work, but they will still need people among their senior ranks with strong leadership qualities. Companies will therefore have every incentive to push back their recruiting timelines and encourage young people to acquire crucial human skills first—the kinds of skills that can best be developed by working in communities to tackle social problems. And young people themselves, even those who might want to run a major company someday, would benefit immensely from devoting the early years of their careers to such challenges.

High schools should inspire students to step outside of their comfort zone and wrestle with pressing social issues. Colleges should live up to their civic missions by guiding students to take a first job in the public interest. The public and social sectors should create more options for students to do this sort of work, and ensure these options are visible and accessible. Corporations should start recruiting young people after they’ve gained these formative experiences, rather than the minute they arrive on campus. And we should all help young people see that their generation’s first jobs predict the future—not only of their careers but of their world.</div>

            <h2>Why MAGA Wants You to Think Slavery Wasn’t That Bad</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/slavery-matt-walsh-1619-project/685982/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Matt Walsh would like you to know you’ve been lied to. Last month, the right-wing provocateur appeared on Megyn Kelly’s show to discuss his new video series, Real History With Matt Walsh. “When you really start getting into it,” Walsh told Kelly, “you realize that, wow, they really lied about everything.”

He begins the series by examining the practice of chattel slavery, he said to Kelly, “because this is, we’re told, the original sin” of the United States. In Walsh’s account, the left believes that “America was built on slavery, and it has no right to exist, and every white American carries, somehow, that legacy, that guilt in their blood”; therefore progressives feel they have the “moral justification to just do whatever they want” to white people. Walsh intends to stop this. So in Real History, he relentlessly downplays the brutality of slavery in the United States.

Sanitizing slavery has become a core objective of the reactionary right under Donald Trump—a malignant response to the progressive left’s oversimplification of American history for their own present-day ends. But the truest understanding of slavery doesn’t serve any political faction. Rather, it acknowledges the horrors of racial oppression while still allowing us to see beyond them.

In 2019, Dean Baquet, then the executive editor of The New York Times, reportedly described “The 1619 Project” to his staff as “the most ambitious examination of the legacy of slavery ever undertaken” by a newspaper. Despite its grand ambition, however, the project arrives at a narrow conclusion: “One of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.”

This argument, which received ample criticism from historians at the time, seems to have emerged from the authors’ commitment to the ideological mission of the “anti-racist” left. As Baquet himself reportedly said, a major goal of the project was not historical but contemporary: “to try to understand the forces that led to the election of Donald Trump.” In reality, the project and its progressive defenders fed those forces rather than clarified them. Before Walsh could even finish explaining to Kelly why slavery occupies such a privileged place in his series, she cut in to provide an answer: Nikole Hannah-Jones, who led “The 1619 Project,” wants people to believe that slavery is, in Kelly’s words, “the whole reason America was formed.”

At the end of Trump’s first term, the White House released The 1776 Report in response to the Times initiative. As the Princeton historian Matthew Karp noted in Harper’s, the document contains a “range of pseudo-patriotic distortions about slavery and the founding era.” Nonetheless, Karp observed, “the report’s authors celebrated Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, praised Reconstruction, and condemned the postbellum South’s descent into Jim Crow, ‘a system that was hardly better than slavery.’”

Whatever modicum of analytical balance that report exhibits is absent in Trump’s second term. Reinterpreting the history of slavery has given way to suppressing its memorialization entirely.

The Trump administration has viewed Juneteenth with particular disdain. Last year, the president used the occasion not to remember emancipation but to complain that America had too many holidays. In December, he ordered the National Park Service to stop allowing free entry on Juneteenth and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Trump added Flag Day in their place, which falls on his own birthday.

Back in March, he strong-armed a host of institutions by issuing an executive order called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which directs federally funded museums, monuments, and parks to remove materials that promote “corrosive ideology.” Last month, the park service obliged, eliminating an outdoor exhibit at Independence National Historical Park, in Philadelphia, where George Washington’s house once stood. The exhibit honored nine slaves who toiled at the residence—part of an effort to explore “the paradox between slavery and freedom.” Such nuance appears to have violated the more patriotic version of history that the government seeks to instill.

The administration has applied perhaps the most pressure on the Smithsonian Institution. In August, the White House ordered the Smithsonian to implement “corrections” to any public-facing materials whose “tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals” the administration deemed unacceptable. On Truth Social, Trump made clear what he thought needed fixing: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” (The Smithsonian has turned over records to federal officials, but late last year, the group’s leader insisted to staffers that it alone was responsible for “all content, programming, and curatorial decisions.”)

In its campaign over the past year, the MAGA movement has squandered what might have been a reasonable position. David Greenberg, a historian at Rutgers University and a biographer of the civil-rights leader John Lewis, told me that the right could have made a persuasive case against the excessive preoccupation with slavery and racial politics that some on the left have shown. Instead, Trump and his allies seem unwilling to tolerate virtually any acknowledgment that America subjugated Black people. Rather than making a dispassionate case against the idea that the country was founded to enslave Africans, MAGA is taking down plaques commemorating basic facts, such as Washington’s slaveholding. “That’s not turning back the last 10 years,” Greenberg said. “That’s turning back historical understanding to the 1960s, if not further.”

In Real History, Walsh turns the clock back further still. One of his principal aims is to show that slavery was the norm across human history, and that American slavery was hardly the most extreme version. (Among other oversights, he fails to acknowledge that the link America forged between bondage and racial identity had little precedent in antiquity.) Walsh appears to think this lets American slaveholders off the hook. When all are guilty, he seems to suggest, no one is. The argument recalls Thomas Jefferson’s infamous defense of slavery in Notes on the State of Virginia. “We know that among the Romans,” Jefferson wrote, “the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent of America.”

Walsh also notes that the descendants of Africans trafficked to what became the United States are now in better socioeconomic shape than those whose ancestors remained in the Old World or were transported to Latin America or the Caribbean. He draws an odious conclusion from this—American slavery wasn’t that bad—yet the point is not entirely incorrect. Other far more serious thinkers have made versions of it too.

America’s slaves lived “in the presence of more human freedom and individual opportunity than they or anybody else had ever seen before,” the Black critic Albert Murray wrote in his 1970 essay collection, The Omni-Americans. “The conception of being a free man in America was infinitely richer than any notion of individuality in the Africa of that period.” Many slaves, Murray noted, internalized this ideal of American freedom despite their own subjugation. “The fugitive slave, for instance, was culturally speaking certainly an American, and a magnificent one at that.”

Clint Smith: Tell students the truth about American history

And this points to the crux of the matter. When recounted accurately, from beginning to end, the story of slavery is the most inspirational and unifying narrative that the country has. Today’s multiethnic society is deeply flawed, of course, but the fact that it emerged from such cruel beginnings should be a source of pride for Americans of every background.

“The destruction of slavery is one of the great American achievements,” Sean Wilentz, a historian at Princeton and critic of “The 1619 Project,” told me. “Taking slavery seriously in American history is not anti-American. The story of slavery in the U.S. is about an ancient institution that was planted here, thrived here, and then was confronted and ultimately attacked in the 19th century through enormous sacrifice, including military conflict. That’s an extraordinary American story.”

For MAGA revisionists as well as some progressives, commemorating slavery implies that the U.S. is permanently stained by it. Yet downplaying or exaggerating American slavery threatens something even graver than perpetual guilt: the loss of the country’s shared moral language.

The story of slavery and its abolition is ultimately one of irrepressible human dignity. Properly told, it makes reconciliation possible and future injustice avoidable.</div>

            <h2>Rod Dreher Thinks the Enlightenment Was a Mistake</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/rod-dreher-religious-conservativism-jd-vance/685732/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On an April evening last year, Rod Dreher sat in the front row of an auditorium at the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, D.C., giddy with pride and happiness. He was there for the screening of a new documentary series based on one of his books, Live Not by Lies, about Christian dissidents from the former Soviet bloc—but first, a special guest was making his way toward the stage. J. D. Vance arrived at the podium to a roar of applause and told the crowd that he would not be the vice president of the United States if not for his friend Rod.

It was Dreher, Vance said, who latched on to his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, a decade ago and promoted it on his blog for The American Conservative, helping to vault the book to the best-seller list. Dreher then became a friend and adviser to Vance as he launched his political career. After praising Dreher for 10 minutes, Vance invited him onstage. The two men hugged, each of them saying, “I love you, man.”

Unlike many in the crowd, Dreher, then 58, was not a staunch Donald Trump supporter; he had long criticized the president and came around only at the beginning of his second term, after concluding that Trump’s crude energy was needed to defeat progressive ideas. But Dreher has been giving voice to the yearnings and frustrations of religious conservatives for many years—as a magazine blogger with more than 1 million pageviews a month, an author of best-selling books, and a deliriously verbose writer on Substack. In January he joined The Free Press as a regular contributor. More than anyone else I know of, Dreher offers a full-fledged portrait of the cultural despair that haunts our era, a despair that has helped pave a road toward tyranny.

Dreher emerged from the conservative blogosphere in the 2000s and won fans with his daily stream of testy opinions and unguarded anecdotal writing. He seems almost allergic to ideological consistency, has long had readers on the left as well as the right, and sometimes changes his mind over the course of a single paragraph. He can be mean-spirited at times, but is quick with a heartfelt apology when he thinks he has made a mistake. His columns are often a collage of quotes from the day’s news and from an eclectic cast of literary and philosophical idols: Dante, perhaps, or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, or the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre.

When Dreher became a prominent figure a decade ago, he seemed resigned to the idea that religious conservatives like him had lost the political battle. In The Benedict Option—the 2017 book that put him on the map—he counseled a patiently monastic approach to Christians who felt that their faith was endangered in a relentlessly secularizing era. Drawing inspiration from Saint Benedict of Nursia, who founded thriving monasteries in the sixth century as Rome decayed, he wrote of a future in which committed Christians “will have to be somewhat cut off from mainstream society for the sake of holding on to the truth.”

But over the past decade, the rightward shift of politics has made clear that Dreher’s intuitions are more widely shared than he once thought. Take his interest in the supernatural and the demonic, the theme of his latest book, Living in Wonder. “The world is not what we think it is,” Dreher writes. “It is so much weirder.” We must disavow our scientific materialism and learn “to open our eyes to the reality of the world of spirit and how it interacts with matter.”

Such ideas appear to have fueled some of the more apocalyptic currents on the Trumpist right, such as Peter Thiel’s musings on the anti-Christ and the ravings of Dan Bongino, the former deputy director of the FBI, who has said that demons are real. Before Tucker Carlson went public in 2024 with his story about being attacked in bed by a demon, he confided in Dreher.

I first began reading Dreher’s Substack a couple of years ago and felt as if I’d stepped into another world. Dreher spends much of his time with monks, back-to-the-land theologians, and exorcists. He believes that a great spiritual battle is under way: “As faith has receded, and interest in the occult and pornography has grown, so has demonic activity.” He continues, “Priests must understand that they are dealing with discarnate beings—fallen angels—who are vastly more intelligent than mortals.” Dreher often speaks of AI as a portal to the demonic, and he feels similarly about the trans-rights movement, which he sees as a symptom of a progressive dystopia in which there are no “structures of truth outside the choosing self.”

To a secular ear, all of this supernatural talk can sound like useful idiocy that serves only the autocrats Dreher sometimes praises—people such as Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s authoritarian leader, who are always in need of a crisis, spiritual or otherwise, to justify their most extreme measures. Dreher moved to Budapest in 2022 and is on familiar terms with Orbán and other European conservatives.

But if Dreher is any sort of courtier—a suggestion he would angrily reject—he is entirely sincere in his beliefs, and his deepest concerns are more religious than political. He seems tempted by the idea that Trump’s wrecking ball could clear the ground for a cultural rebirth. “I had never been enthusiastic about Trump,” Dreher told me, “but I was enthusiastic about him this time because it seemed like only somebody like him could put a stop” to “wokeness and the madness of transgenderism.”

Dreher’s writing is a useful indication of just how angry and pessimistic even the most thoughtful conservatives have become in recent years. He seems to see America as a hellscape, drained of religion and hope, drugged and distracted by the false gods of the internet. The renewal he imagines is not the sunlit, future-oriented conservatism of the Reagan era, and he doesn’t look to the Founding Fathers for inspiration. If anything, Dreher’s compass points in the opposite direction. He wants his country to turn back toward Europe—not the homogenized, secular continent of today but premodern Christian Europe, before the Enlightenment and the disenchantment set in.

I met up with Dreher in early June outside the Church of Saint-Sulpice, in Paris. We were surrounded by thousands of excited young Catholics preparing for the start of an annual pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres, organized by devotees of the traditional Latin Mass. The pilgrimage is a rallying point for conservative Christians from across Europe and beyond; Catholic political figures sometimes join the pilgrims for a stretch.

“This is my world but not my world,” Dreher told me as we ambled through the crowd. He meant that he is Christian and conservative, but no longer Catholic. He left the faith 20 years ago, disgusted by the Church’s handling of the sex-abuse scandal, and became an Eastern Orthodox Christian. But he still feels an affinity with Catholics, especially the theological conservatives who adhere to the Latin liturgy that was universal in the Church until the Vatican II reforms of the 1960s.

“I can’t think of the last time I felt so happy,” Dreher said, in a drawl that evokes his Louisiana origins. His joy was partly a measure of his long-running preoccupation with the future of Europe, where the broader culture has been steadily marching away from Christianity. Fewer than a quarter of French people ages 18 to 23 identify as Catholic. The continent’s eroding religious traditions and cultural loyalties, and its surging population of Muslim migrants, are a constant and gloomy obsession in Dreher’s posts. But here, surrounded on this morning by Christian pilgrims, he felt sparks of hope.

A Mass began inside the church, and loudspeakers broadcast the sounds of a choir to the overflow audience outside. All talk ceased, and thousands of people crossed themselves and knelt on the pavement. It was a very different Paris from the one most tourists or even Parisians see.

Dreher’s excitement about the pilgrims turned out to be mutual. A number of them rushed up to greet him as the journey began. His work has gained a following in France, especially among young people who grew up in a thoroughly secularized Europe and are hungry for a more traditional or mystical experience. “Rod allowed the French to pose the question of faith in a new way,” Yrieix Denis, a 34-year-old Catholic writer and consultant who helped get The Benedict Option published in French, told me. Dreher’s perspective was refreshing, Denis said, because he had no stake in the political arguments that consumed and divided older French Catholics; he just wanted to help people sustain their faith in a hostile climate. And his warnings about demons lurking in our cellphones and laptops seem to resonate with the younger generation.

Dreher’s ideas about the decline of Christianity in Europe—once seen as a little conspiratorial—are now becoming something like the official view of the Trump administration. When Vance attended the annual Munich Security Conference as a first-term senator, in 2024, he got fed up with the European Union bureaucrats and took off early to reconnect with Dreher, who had come from Budapest, over beer and sausages. A year later, Vance returned to Munich as vice president and vented his feelings about the arrogance of Europe’s ruling elite and the dangers of mass immigration in a speech that could almost have been written by Dreher, accusing the European leaders seated before him of betraying their own civilization. Those themes were echoed in December, when the Trump administration released a new National Security Strategy warning that Europe was in danger of “civilizational erasure.”

The pilgrims marched westward out of the city, carrying crucifixes and flags bearing the names of local saints. They would be camping outdoors for two nights on their way to Chartres, but Dreher would not be joining them. “I’m a crotchety old bastard who won’t camp,” he’d told me.

Dreher’s phone lit up often as we strolled through the newly empty streets toward the Latin Quarter. He presents a peculiar blend of gregariousness and inner solitude—connected to many people around the world yet profoundly lonely. His marriage broke up years ago, and he is now mostly estranged from his former wife and two of his three children. He lives alone in Budapest.

His daily routine, Dreher told me, is a trip to a local café followed by hours of reading and writing. Later he will walk around the city, his only form of exercise, and perhaps meet friends for drinks or dinner. During the five days I spent with him in France, he wrote and published four online columns, each several thousand words long. When I expressed surprise at his output, he said: “It’s all I do.”

Dreher didn’t shy away from questions about his belief in the supernatural. He told me that he had once seen a woman possessed by demons while he was visiting her and her husband at their Upper East Side apartment, a story he recounts in Living in Wonder. The demons weren’t themselves visible: One of them shouted obscenities through the woman’s mouth, the way a demon possessed Linda Blair’s character in The Exorcist, until her husband managed to silence it with a “relic of the True Cross” hidden in his pocket. The woman apologized for the demon’s outburst, saying, “That wasn’t me.”

Dreher rattled off other encounters he’s had with poltergeists and various nameless spirits. At the same time, he made clear that he wasn’t sure how real these experiences were or what they meant, and noted that this was precisely the point: We should not remain “locked in an iron cage of scientism and rationality.”

I got the sense that, for Dreher, the demonic is partly a metaphor, a way of talking about the psychic disturbances of our age. At his best, he is capable of shedding light on these disturbances, and not in narrowly religious terms. Dreher has a gift for articulating the unease that many people, including thinkers on the left, feel about the rapid erosion of borders and traditions of all kinds and the birth of an online landscape that seems to promise infinite autonomy but is in fact a “vast disenchantment machine.”

To Dreher, these changes are not just the queasy side effects of a world that is shedding outworn rules and becoming freer. They represent the fraying of a social and cultural order built on Christianity, and are responsible for a litany of troubling symptoms: loneliness, rising rates of anxiety, political polarization. “If you wanted to create a society and a culture that’s guaranteed to make people miserable,” Dreher told me, citing the psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist, “you couldn’t do better than what we’re living in now.” Dreher often invokes the experience of fourth-century Romans, who could not see that the ageless pagan world they’d inherited was at an end, and that they were on the verge of a radically new and less stable era.

In recent years, Dreher’s premonitions have caught on with a number of secular-minded people who have concluded that the West needs Christianity to protect it from an array of perceived threats, including the spread of Islam. Some, such as the Somali-born author and former atheist Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the British comedian Russell Brand, have converted to Christianity. Others, such as Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, seem ambivalent or opportunistic. (Rogan said in 2024 that, “as time rolls on, people are going to understand the need to have some sort of divine structure to things.”) Perhaps Dreher’s most surprising ally is the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion and other atheistic broadsides, who has declared that he is now a “cultural Christian.”

But lately Dreher’s insights have come with an ominous political corollary. He believes our institutions are so rotten that they need a good slap from people like Trump and Orbán, even if it means losing some of them. “Maybe what’s being born now will be worse, I dunno,” he wrote as Trump and Elon Musk were using DOGE to dismantle the federal bureaucracy in early 2025. “We’ll see. But bring it on. I’ve had it.”

Dreher didn’t always talk this way. In early 2017, he told an audience at the National Press Club that Trump’s election suggested a weakness in the faith of the many Christians who had voted for him. Trump was another symptom of a “consumerist, individualistic, post-Christian society that worships the self.” The writer Andrew Sullivan, who has been a friend and occasional sparring partner of Dreher’s for decades, told me he believes Dreher hasn’t really changed. “The politics came to him more than the other way around,” Sullivan said, suggesting that Dreher was radicalized by his opposition to the trans-rights movement, Black Lives Matter, and other progressive causes.

The past decade may have been a very successful one for Dreher—he published three books and gained a much wider following—but it has also been a time of deep suffering, as anyone who reads his posts knows. His family broke apart in multiple ways, culminating in a divorce that took a terrible toll and left him almost entirely alone. When I first met Dreher, over dinner at a Sichuan restaurant in New York in April, he looked careworn, with signs of fatigue around the eyes. I couldn’t help wondering whether Dreher’s diagnosis of a “civilizational crisis,” demons and all, was partly a measure of his own emotional turmoil.

The story of Dreher’s personal Calvary begins with his father, who seems to be the key to his lifelong struggle to get closer to God. Ray Dreher was a rural public-health officer and a stubborn authoritarian who expected his children to spend their life in the Louisiana town of St. Francisville (population 1,557), where they grew up. Rod, his only son, loved books and dreamed from an early age of getting away to Europe. As an adolescent, he scorned the narrowness of his parents’ lives, their views (Ray appears to have been a member of the Ku Klux Klan), and their bland Methodism—“Christianity as psychological and social wallpaper,” as Dreher put it to me. He got out as soon as he could, going to college at Louisiana State University and then moving to the East Coast. His father never really forgave him for it.

Dreher traveled far from St. Francisville over the following decades, as an inner restlessness led from one religious incarnation to another. He started off as a secular liberal, but in his mid-20s he felt drawn back to faith, thanks in part to a one-night stand that led to a brief pregnancy scare. He converted to Catholicism at the age of 26 in St. Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington, D.C. In 2006, he found a new home in Eastern Orthodoxy, an even more tradition-bound branch of Christianity.

In 2011, as Dreher was building a national reputation as a columnist, he decided to move back to St. Francisville with his wife and children. He had gained a new appreciation for his hometown after his younger sister, Ruthie, was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. Dreher was living in Philadelphia at the time, and during visits back home, he discovered that she had become a kind of local saint, revered for her charity and love of God. Ruthie’s funeral—which he described in a long post for The American Conservative and later in a book, The Little Way of Ruthie Leming—brought out a deep sense of community. The love he saw there, he wrote, was “a thing of such intense beauty it’s hard to look upon it and hold yourself together.” Dreher wanted to be part of it, and to reconcile with his father.

The return was a spectacular failure. His father refused to relinquish his grudge, as Dreher saw it, and his mother always went along with her husband. Dreher told me the rift wounded him so badly that, for four years, he was mostly bedridden with chronic mononucleosis, sleeping four to six hours in the middle of the day. “The thing that I wanted more than anything else in the world,” Dreher wrote years later, “and have wanted from the time I was a little boy, is to feel at Home in this world, with a father who approves of me. That was not to be mine, except, by God’s grace, in heaven.”

He stayed in Louisiana for more than a decade, struggling to maintain a marriage that was failing for reasons that Dreher has never fully spelled out (he says he needs to respect his family’s privacy). Dreher says that only his faith in God sustained him. His writing about all of this is some of his best and most vulnerable. “It feels like that sometimes, that God has forgotten me, has forgotten us men who wanted to be good husbands and good fathers,” he wrote in 2023. “Flannery O’Connor has a character who says she thinks she might be able to be a martyr if they kill her quick. Yeah, me too. But the very slow martyrdom of the woman who bled out for twelve years, and for men and women who suffer the pains of marriages gone bad, and divorce—that’s harder, I think.”

In Paris, we skirted the edge of the Luxembourg Gardens, and the stony gray dome of the Panthéon became visible ahead. “I hate the Panthéon,” Dreher said. For a moment, I was baffled, but Dreher explained: The building where France inters its greatest patriots and public figures is an emblem of the secular faith that spread after the French Revolution, a reminder that the rot in contemporary Europe, as he sees it, goes back to the ideals of the Enlightenment—liberty, scientific inquiry, individualism.

He began talking about the revolutionary mobs of 1793 as if they had swept through yesterday. “Genevieve had always been the city’s local saint,” he said. “But the mob came and took her relics and burned them.” Dreher led me to the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, not far away, which contains what is left of her tomb. As we entered the dim sanctuary, he crossed himself and knelt to touch the floor in deference, an Orthodox tradition. We made our way to the chapel devoted to Saint Genevieve, where Dreher lit a candle for her, kneeled, and prayed.

Dreher can give the impression that it has all been downhill for humanity since the 14th century. In his writing, he offers a potted history of how we fell away from a luminous medieval wholeness, when sacred and secular were as one; when, as he has written, “the entire universe was woven into God’s own Being.” Dreher is well aware that this reactionary outlook strikes many people as ludicrous. He often refers to himself in his columns as “Your Working Boy,” a winking allusion to the half-mad protagonist of John Kennedy Toole’s 1980 comic novel, A Confederacy of Dunces. That character, Ignatius J. Reilly, is a grotesque, obese shut-in who reveres the sixth-century Roman philosopher Boethius and claims to be writing a “lengthy indictment against our century.”

I hear an echo of Ignatius Reilly when Dreher inveighs, as he often does, against progressive orthodoxy, writing incendiary posts with titles such as “Another Day, Another Killer Tranny.” When he champions “normie” values and sensibilities against the “soft totalitarianism” of wokeness, he seems closest to the aggrieved ethos of the MAGA base.

But I saw little evidence of Ignatius Reilly during my time with Dreher. He did not seem motivated by hatred or bitterness but instead came off as kind and humble, with an endearing habit of telling humiliating stories about himself. He seemed almost eager to have his own views challenged, and genuinely saddened by the loss of some of his friendships with liberals in recent years.

When Dreher wrote The Benedict Option, during the Obama presidency, his primary concern was how to keep faith alive at a time when Christianity seemed to be fading away. After it was published, his ideas took a darker turn: The portal to the demonic was getting larger, and Western civilization itself was at risk. Dreher told me he often meets ordinary Europeans who believe that civil conflict is just around the corner. There are certainly people who feel that way, but reading Dreher, it’s hard to avoid the sense that he wants a civilizational crack-up, a cleansing storm that would chase away evil forces and allow for Christian renewal.

This kind of talk has political consequences. How far is he willing to go? Dreher told me firmly that he could never condone a religious belief being forced on anyone, and he has regularly said in his columns that he opposes a totalitarianism of the right as much as one of the left. He told me that authentic Christianity “can’t exist if liberal democracy goes away.” Dreher has written some scathing things in recent months about Trump’s tariffs and his overall fecklessness, and has lost Substack subscribers as a result, he said.

Dreher has also spoken out forcefully against the rise of anti-Semitism and the white-nationalist trolls in the MAGA base known as “Groypers.” In November, he warned Vance about the trend during a visit to Washington. After Dreher criticized Tucker Carlson for hosting the Hitler-loving commentator Nick Fuentes on his podcast, Dreher revealed that Carlson had written to him privately to attack him and that their friendship appeared to be over.

But Dreher has also given plenty of rhetorical support to Trump’s demolition agenda. In February 2025, he wrote: “The System is collapsing? Good. It’s about time.” He hopes for a similarly bold assault on the liberal governments of Western Europe; he would like to see its white, native-born population rise up and fight against the dilution of its Christian heritage. In July, he wrote a melancholy post asking why the British are “acquiescing in their own demise as a people.”

And then there is Dreher’s decision to move to Budapest. I asked him about the price of Orbán’s rule—the shameless undermining of democratic institutions, the rampant corruption, the weak economy, the kowtowing to Vladimir Putin. Dreher told me he doesn’t support everything Orbán has done, but he was full of praise for the Hungarian leader, whom he credits with having rescued his country’s social and cultural integrity by limiting immigration. “The man is a real visionary,” Dreher told me. The two have met only three or four times, he said, but Dreher has been affiliated since 2021 with the Danube Institute, a state-backed think tank that has been a vehicle for disseminating Orbán’s political ideas.

Dreher used his ties with Orbán to help Carlson get an interview, which aired in August 2021. After Carlson gushed about Orbán’s avowedly illiberal approach to governance, American conservatives began making regular visits to Budapest, and references to “the Hungarian model” became a standard feature of Trumpian politics. Dreher bears a share of responsibility for all of this.

After two days of hiking, the pilgrims arrived in Chartres looking sweaty and exultant. Dreher was there to greet them, after an hour-long train ride from Paris. We entered the sanctuary, with its cool scent of ancient stone. Dreher led me to a spot at the center of the nave and gazed down. This, he told me, was the exact stone on which he’d been standing when he had his first true religious experience, at the age of 17. His mother had won a round-trip ticket to Paris at a church raffle back in Louisiana, and she passed it on to him. Young Rod went off to France by himself, and on a visit to Chartres, standing in the nave of the cathedral, he was overcome by a vague but powerful sense that God was real.

Dreher has always sought solace in places that are rooted in tradition and far removed from modern life: hermetic religious communities, island monasteries, European cathedrals. His greatest admiration is reserved for people who commit themselves to “a fixed place and way of life,” as he wrote about Saint Benedict.

Yet Dreher seems resigned to living as a rootless exile, shorn of his family and condemned to wander a landscape of what the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman—one of Dreher’s favorite thinkers—called “liquid modernity.” I sometimes got the sense that all of his pilgrimages amounted to failed efforts to recapture the Edenic solidity of St. Francisville.

I accompanied him on another of these journeys after the Chartres pilgrimage. This one brought us to Rocamadour, a magnificent medieval town in Occitania, set on a cliffside above a tributary of the Dordogne River. Dreher had wanted to see the medieval chapel of Notre-Dame de Rocamadour for years, and for a curious reason: It is the site of a crucial scene in Michel Houellebecq’s controversial 2015 novel, Submission, in which the protagonist makes a failed attempt at religious conversion. The novel portrays France as a place so spiritually exhausted that it gives in to Islamic rule without much of a fight. Houellebecq is a famously cynical figure, and an odd bedfellow for Dreher. But the story made a deep impression on him.

We climbed the old stone steps toward the chapel. Above one entryway, a sword is lodged in the stone, said to have found its place there in the eighth century after being thrown more than 100 miles by Roland, the hero of the medieval chanson that bears his name. (This sword was actually a replica. A year earlier, the original had been stolen.)

The sanctuary was dark and silent. On the far wall, framed by a red-and-gold Gothic arch, was the Black Virgin, a doll-like wooden figure that pilgrims come to see. It is here that Houellebecq’s antihero, François, feels the stirrings of something divine. But the feeling fades, and he dismisses it as an effect of hypoglycemia and goes home. Dreher knelt in one of the pews and prayed.

He told me later that he’d been drawn to Houellebecq’s novel because of “what it says about the disposition one needs toward mystical experiences.” Many people, he said, lack the courage to act on their spiritual intuitions. Dreher himself may still be poised between belief and unbelief, struggling to break through the boundaries of the secular world he lives in. “Sometimes I ask, Am I fooling myself ? ” he told me at one point. But when he sees something like the Chartres pilgrimage, “I know I’m onto something.”

Late that afternoon, we got in the car and drove away. The route took us along rural roads with views of sun-gilded fields and hillsides. Dreher fell into a pensive mood. I asked him what lessons these holy places might hold for America. He said he wasn’t sure. But the question led us back to his friendship with Vance, and he recounted a strange dream he’d had the night before: “I was supposed to marry Arianna Huffington,” he said, “and J.D. was supposed to marry the girl I had a crush on in high school, but couldn’t have. I arranged things so that we switched brides. But then I was exposed and felt humiliated.”

To me, the dream suggested that Dreher sees Vance as a kind of secret sharer, as well as a possible vehicle for the mysteries he was chasing among the monks and pilgrims. Vance is the kind of figure who might help create the conditions for a reenchantment of American life, or so Dreher hopes. “That man is the future of America,” Dreher wrote in April. If Trump represents Armageddon, Vance for Dreher may be something like the Rapture.

After the 2024 election, a number of people urged Dreher to move to Washington, saying he could capitalize on his friendship with Vance and double his readership. I sensed that Dreher had considered the idea, however briefly. Were Vance to become president, the temptation to return would be even stronger. Dreher might be offered honors, or unique access to the administration as a writer. Would he seize the chance?

He told me he would not. He is more useful to Vance at a distance, he said. In any case, he is not looking for a political messiah. He wants the real thing.

            <h2>Carrie Prejean Boller Is Not Going Quietly</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/carrie-prejean-boller-religious-liberty/685987/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“It is not a biblical mandate that I have to worship Israel,” Carrie Prejean Boller told me today. The former Miss California USA turned social-media influencer was dismissed from President Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission yesterday after drawing charges of anti-Semitism. But, she wanted to make clear, she regrets nothing—and has no intention of disappearing without a fight.

On Tuesday, the Religious Liberty Commission held its fifth hearing, in Washington, D.C., to discuss anti-Jewish prejudice. Meetings of blue-ribbon panels are typically sleepy, stage-managed affairs designed to serve the purposes of whatever administration put them together. But Boller had other ideas. She repeatedly interrogated the participants about their opinions on anti-Zionism, which she distinguished from anti-Semitism, and complained that other panelists had called Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, the wildly popular podcasters, anti-Semitic.

Video of Boller’s interjections went viral, sparking furious recriminations on the right. “I’m with her,” declared former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Boller took to social media in her own defense and began resharing others’ support for her conduct, including Owens’s claim that the two women were being assailed for refusing to “support the mass slaughter and rape of innocent children for occult Baal worshipers.” Boller’s performance raised her profile—her previously marginal X account increased its following 20-fold. “Be a good Goyim and give me a follow,” she posted Tuesday afternoon, inaccurately using the plural form of the colloquial Hebrew word for “non-Jew.” Yesterday, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the chair of the Religious Liberty Commission, announced that Boller had been removed, saying in a statement that “no member of the Commission has the right to hijack a hearing for their own personal and political agenda on any issue.”

Yair Rosenberg: The MAGA influencers rehabilitating Hitler

When I interviewed Boller by phone about her experience, she told me that the first attempt to oust her from the commission came back in August, when she received a phone call from a staffer at the Office of Presidential Personnel asking her to step down. Boller attributed this effort to her social-media posts about the devastation in Gaza. She alleged that Patrick and Paula White, a confidante of Trump’s whom Boller described as an “absolute evangelical demon,” had been “colluding with the White House.” (The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Boller cited her faith when explaining her position, as she had at the hearing. “It’s anti-Christian to accuse me of anti-Semitism by being a Christian,” she said. She reiterated that Zionism is not compatible with her Catholicism, the faith to which she converted in April. The Vatican has long recognized the state of Palestine and called for a two-state solution, positions at odds with those of the current Israeli government, but it has also backed Israel’s right to exist. Indeed, as long as the subject was Israel, Boller was eager to engage. But when the conversation turned to other things that she had said at the commission hearing that pertained to anti-Semitism, not merely anti-Zionism, she suddenly became much more evasive.

“I would really appreciate it if you would stop calling Candace Owens an anti-Semite,” she told one of the witnesses at the hearing, Seth Dillon, the CEO of the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee. “I don’t know why you keep bringing her up and Tucker,” she added. “Because they’re the two most famous anti-Semites,” retorted Dillon. “Everyone’s an anti-Semite!” Boller replied. “Do you think that anything Candace has said is anti-Semitic?” Dillon later asked. “No, I don’t,” Boller responded. “I listen to her daily, and I haven’t heard one thing out of her mouth that I would say is anti-Semitic.”

As it happens, Owens has said many deranged things about Jews, plenty of which have nothing to do with Israel. So I was surprised to hear her so vigorously defended at a hearing ostensibly devoted to combatting anti-Jewish bigotry. I raised the subject with Boller, who regularly reposts content from Owens on social media, and I quoted several recent claims that the podcaster had made.

On February 2, for instance, Owens praised the decision of General Ulysses S. Grant to expel all Jews from his military district in 1862, during the Civil War. The move was soon reversed by President Abraham Lincoln, and Grant later disavowed it—but Owens did not. “Jewish supremacists,” she said, “had everything to do with the Civil War in America. They excel at creating the false dialectic, the North versus the South, the left versus the right. Ulysses S. Grant notoriously expelled Jews from his military district: Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky. You think he just—he was just, like, what? Another white supremacist? Everyone’s just a white supremacist,” she said. “Well, they would have called him a white supremacist” or said that “he was anti-Semitic.”

I read this monologue to Boller and asked her if she thought it was anti-Semitic to defend expelling American Jews. “I’m not going to get involved in any of that,” she said. “I watched her show, and I have never heard anything out of her mouth that is anti-Semitic. So I’m not gonna make a statement on something that I haven’t heard the full context of.” I offered to play Boller the audio of this remark in its full context. She declined to listen. So I moved on to another of Owens’s greatest hits: blaming American Jews for the African slave trade. This canard has been repeatedly debunked by historians and repeatedly invoked by Owens. “Jewish people were the ones that were trading us,” she said in December. “Jewish people were in control of the slave trade. They’ve buried a lot of it, but it’s there and you can find it.”

Was this anti-Semitic? “From what I’ve heard from my ears, from her mouth, I have not heard anything that is anti-Semitic,” Boller repeated. Okay, but if someone such as Owens did say such things, it would be anti-Semitic, right? “I’m not playing the ‘What if?’ game,” she said, her previous moral clarity abruptly turning into cagey ambiguity.

I had hoped to ask Boller for her opinion about other claims made by Owens—that “Talmudic Jews” think “that we’re animals, that they have a right to own us, that they have a right to make us worship them,” and that Israel was complicit in the 9/11 attacks and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy—but she refused to engage and eventually ended the call. Rather than reckon with anti-Semitic statements from those she had defended at a hearing intended to confront anti-Semitism, she repeatedly attempted to reroute our conversation back to the safer ground of criticizing Israel. She either did not realize that she was using anti-Zionism as a pretext to launder vulgar anti-Semitism and its purveyors into the public square, or she did not care.

Although Boller may not be willing to answer such questions from a reporter, she is also not backing away from her views. Before our conversation concluded, she told me that she planned to show up at the Religious Liberty Commission’s next meeting because, she argued, only President Trump himself has the authority to fire her. “I remain on this commission until I hear from the president,” she said. “I want the president to admit: Is he ‘America First’ or ‘Israel First’?”</div>

            <h2>What Fabulous Timing for Gallup to Stop Tracking Presidential Approval!</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/gallup-poll-presidential-approval/685986/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two men from headquarters walked out to the corral to tell the pollster the news. They were a big man and a little man. They were identically attired, in a dark suit and dark glasses. Both carried a briefcase.

The pollster was leaning against the split-rail fence, looking at the horses. (The horses had started to appear 88 years ago due to a misspelling of Gallup. A new one arrived with each completed poll.)

“It’s not because the president’s approval rating has been so low,” the big man said.

“Oh?” the pollster said, looking at the men. He was old, somewhere from 55 to 80 (with a 99 percent confidence interval), and wore a wide-brimmed hat that looked his same age, or up to three years older than he was (with a 95 percent confidence interval). He looked cross, though not as cross as some cross-tabs that he had considered.

“It has nothing to do with that at all!” the little man said.

“Oh?” the pollster said. “Within what confidence interval?”

“It has nothing to do with the current presidency and how the president bullies people, especially the people responsible for numbers,” the big man said. “It’s not that he famously believes that his own net worth fluctuates depending on his mood, and that he seems to think other numbers should do the same thing—jobs numbers and poll numbers and vote totals and interest rates—and that if they don’t, it is because the numbers have ganged up on him maliciously.”

“Of course not!” the little man said. “Please don’t draw any imputations.”

“I wasn’t,” the pollster said, “but if anyone could do so accurately, I could.”

In the field, Harry Truman’s Approval Rating whinnied and tossed its head, and Richard Nixon’s Approval Rating flopped on one side and emitted a horrible gurgle.  “I wish we didn’t have horse personifications of all the approval ratings,” the little man said. “It gives me the creeps.”

“Horse-sonifications,” the pollster said.

“I’ll note it on the Likert scale.” The pollster fed Lyndon B. Johnson’s Second Term some oats. “But we’re Gallup polls, and this is what we do.”

“But we could stop at any time,” the big man said. “Like, February 2026. Definitely not a time when people want to know accurately how approved of the president is. Maybe they do! Maybe they don’t! We can’t know!”

“We can know,” the pollster said. “We are, in fact, experts. And have been for 88 years.”

“A good, long run,” the little man said. “A great run. Perfect time to stop.”

“Is it?” the pollster asked. “The perfect time?”

“I hear what you’re saying,” the big man replied, after a moment. “But do we need to have numbers about it? Maybe we can just do a drawing. That gets the same idea across. A sad face, and people can draw their own conclusions. Numbers are so—”

“Think about it another way,” the little man said. “When we go out for the numbers, don’t you worry about your crew? When the ratings plummet so steeply, do you ever worry they’ll take a pollster down with them?”

The pollster shrugged. “They train for it,” he said. “They believe in the value of a good number, even if that number is frightening to behold. They’ve seen things down in the cross-tabs that would turn your hair white.”

“I thought hair color was a discrete variable,” the little man said, “not a dependent variable.”

“You think they can’t handle this? This is exactly when we need good, accurate numbers most. You’re oversampling your fear. You should be independent, like one of the variables we measure, not dependent, like other, different, variables we measure.”

“It’s not because of fear,” the little man said. “It’s because of ‘an evolution in how Gallup focuses its public research and thought leadership.’”

In the field, Barack Obama’s First-Term Approval Rating whinnied.

“This change is part of a broader, ongoing effort to align all of Gallup’s public work with its mission.”

“We look forward to continuing to offer independent research that adheres to the highest standards of social science.”

Around them, night was starting to fall, covering the field in shadow.

“This is a strategic shift solely based on Gallup’s research goals and priorities,” the little man concluded.

“And what goals and priorities are those?” the pollster asked.

“Well,” the big man said. He looked uncomfortable. “Look, it’s a downer, having to bring these disapproval ratings over and over, month after month. Too many numbers make everyone sad! If you must know, we’re thinking of getting more into vibes.”

It was fully dark now. Across the field, something started to come toward them. Its horrible whinnying sounded like laughter. In the darkness, they couldn’t see what it was.

The pollster shrugged. “Next month’s,” he said. “Don’t you wish you had a little more data right about now?”</div>

The bigger issue is, it&#39;s become pretty obvious Flock gives these entities access to their cameras and images regardless of the existence of a warrant - and without getting permission from (or even notifying) the Flock customer who&#39;s paying for the camera.

Of course Flock gives LEO access to everything frictionlessly. Their main business is selling ALPR systems to LEO and related local government, so the pitch will be buy ALPR and we give you access to all this other coverage.

They just sell directI mean they&#39;ve got all the data they&#39;ve got a brazilion computers to store and process that data.What do they need flock for in the first place?

Earlier the previous evening, my Ring camera managed to capture the neighbor&#39;s teenager backing into my parked work van.  Thanks to the camera, I&#39;ve got timestamped footage footage of both the before and after.  Now, you might be thinking to yourself &quot;Surely they owned up to their mistake and you don&#39;t need surveillance footage?&quot;  Nope, the parent/guardian was extremely belligerent about the whole thing, with a main character attitude like their kid was just playing GTA and hitting a NPC&#39;s parked car is no big deal.

So no, I won&#39;t be smashing my Ring camera.  We need these things because some people no longer do the right thing even when you&#39;ve got them on video.  I used to wonder why almost everyone in Russia seemed to have a dashcam - now I completely understand why.

Amazon Ring, flocked up, a new ring of &quot;truthiness.&quot; Then in a year, it will be announced they did a deal with some other surveillance company, ring around the rosie.

Ring cameras in the US are apparently usually mounted so that they film your entryway, behind that the public sidewalk and street, and across from that your neighbor&#39;s house. To me - in Europe - that seems insane. Here, it is generally illegal to film public areas, because people have a right to move through the world without being tracked. And it is hugely illegal to film other people&#39;s property, because - well, that ought to be obvious - it&#39;s their property and not yours.

And yet here we have a business that not only lets you record all of that, but actively hands it out to anyone who wants it, for any reason whatsoever.

I have nothing against cameras filming what&#39;s happening on your own property, but Ring has normalized surveilling your neighbors.

> Here, it is generally illegal to film public areas, because people have a right to move through the world without being tracked.

Where exactly is &quot;here&quot;? CCTV coverage in Europe seems pretty pervasive, from what I&#39;ve seen. All sorts of tracking, people and ANPR, presumably by the government.

The government-sponsored Maks chat engine, which is linked to the State Services portal.

It is very neat, as you can not only find the St. Peterburg&#39;s babes videos, but also see your kid&#39;s grades from school in it, submit a report on your neighbors&#39; enemy activities, apply for a stormtrooper slot in the Special Military Operation and even send your farewell video to your widow up to the very moment that drone kills you.

It is a great service, the greatest service that was ever designed.

Out of Greenlad solidarity we should do the same in Europe. US Tech is a danger to the liberties in our societies. It is a small measure we could take against the Trump regime and hiis backers.

No no it&#39;s only the chinese who are bad. Meta is fine, openai is fine, apple is fine, microsoft is fine, look they are even listed on the stock market.

They are blocking VPNs since way before the war embargoes and escalations (I presume there are some state approved VPNs but they would be worse than no VPN). They&#39;re blocking TOR too, and both aren&#39;t just regular DPI content inspection (that can be faked fairly well currently) but also actively going after the entry points and blocking them completely. This isn&#39;t trivial to bypass, as you somehow need to give people the nodes that are available for connection, and you don&#39;t know which one is a snitch. Of co

How are they blocking WhatsApp? Is there a Great Firewall of Russia?

The article mentions DNS removal, essentially DNS filtering. But, DNS filtering is an inconvenience, far from a &quot;complete block&quot;.

So, what&#39;s up with WhatsApp in Putinstan.

If you work as Russian government troll spreading propaganda in the west you can still use WhatsApp in your work.

The idea is to make it harder people from the West to reach people in Russia, not trolls in Russia to reach people in the West...

You took something simple like Notepad, added features we didn&#39;t want, and not only made it worse but actually made it insecure and fundamentally broken.

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.

The goal of Microsoft is to keep turning record profits after they saturated the market 30 years ago. Want to make sure your endpoints are up to date on patches? They now have a subscription for that. Want to avoid installing crap like this in the first place? They have a subscription for that too.

What Microsoft overlooks is that there is a red line where they will just die if they cross it. They are dangerously close to that line and may be over it. I mean, how utterly incompetent can you get? A mistake like the one here can only happen if security aspects were completely ignored during development.

Any good monopolist knows that they have to deliver at least somewhat reasonable quality to retain the monopoly. MS does not understand that. Hence their products are now incompetently made toys.

That&#39;s generally true but MS is only obliquely in the OS game it seems to me. They are concentrating on &quot;cloud&quot; and &quot;AI&quot;, and companies are sending them money for these things. So they can completely screw the pooch on their toy OS and run all their crap on Unix and Linux and I doubt that would phase them. They probably already have versions of their biggest money spinner software running on those platforms.

And yet their cloud offerings have been hacked several times now and had additional really bad vulnerability where nobody know whether they got exploited ...

I think I do not need to even comment on the future of their AI plans ...

And taking a simple but still useful product like Notepad, and bitching it up to the point that it is now a malware vector has me shaking my head, not in disbelief, but &quot;here we go again&quot;.  At this point, I only use my Windows Laptop if there&#39;s no other choice.

I think we are at a decision point now. It can still go either way. I hope we will get the momentum that we can finally all ditch Microsoft over the next few years.

This could have been prevented by not removing Wordpad.Yes. But that would require somebody sane with some actual insight and understanding of IT security at Microsoft making decisions. They do not have such people.

I don&#39;t know why these companies don&#39;t realize when you take an application that can&#39;t execute anything and you make it into an application that will execute anything depending on embedded codes, it&#39;s worth scrutinizing it.  If you don&#39;t have the manpower or skills available to scrutinize it then you don&#39;t change it.  Isn&#39;t that obvious?

Your post is non-sequitur.Firstly, the simple version of Notepad has had quite a few critical security flaws over the years. https://threatpost.com/researc...

Microsoft has no security mind-set, while having a lot of security-critical products. Obviously, they mess it up time and again. Although the level of sheer incompetence on display here is astonishing even for them. Also remember &quot;Security is our highest priority&quot; (stated last probably in 2024 by MS CEO). If they make mistakes this grossly clueless and dangerous now, it just means they cannot do it right. No other interpretation is possible.

I just think the cause is a bit different.

They have this habit of making everything as general as possible without thinking through the implications, while trying to &quot;extend&quot; anything they didn&#39;t make. So you end up with a generic URL parsing library that will happily launch installers from a text file in Notepad and similar nonsensical capabilities nobody in their right mind would intentionally use. Software for Martians, borne out of nai

I agree with your statement. But I do not think that is a different reason. They have no security mind-set and no actual security experts involved in the decision making. That is what I would call &quot;cannot do security&quot;. In the case at hand, any halfway competent IT security expert would have told them that this was excessively risky. Remember the log4shell vulnerability? This is basically the same stupid thing.

Incidentally, this bright-eyed &quot;can do&quot; attitude is the hallmark of bloody amateurs.

Youtuber Low Level did a pretty good video on this vulnerability. Yes it is a bad vulnerability and yes it is serious, but it&#39;s not like a user isn&#39;t warned several times when clicking on such a link.

He also pointed out that the drive to put AI into everything now makes restricting process permissions a lot harder. For example in the past there was no reason to ever let notepad.exe access the internet.  Now with copilot integrated, it&#39;s regularly accessing the internet.  I don&#39;t think the boys at MS were thinking this through clearly.https://youtu.be/sZ8aAkeZ6dw [youtu.be]

but it&#39;s not like a user isn&#39;t warned several times when clicking on such a link. But why does every app have to be a browser? Is this functionality going to be added to solitaire? Why not?To me it seems that if Microsoft was in the tool business every thing would need to be, or function like, a hammer.

Should I upgrade my win10 to win11? Am I late to the party?

Notepad has been released for DOS in 1983 and for windos in 1985.It seems 40 years just is not enough time to create a half decent text editor!

Microsoft claimed they were discontinuing Wordpad to reduce security flaw exposure from barely used unpatched and unmaintained software.

But at least they are consistent. Microsoft has a history of security issues on really basic software such as Notepad https://threatpost.com/researc... [threatpost.com]

Let the stream of malware happily continue...

I just need a good text editor with 4 functions:Open (text-only files), save, search and replace.No markdown support, no AI copilot, no formatting, no lists, no URL support, no tables, no autocorrect.

Ya know, kinda just like the old notepad, except with the ability to show line numbers (the only thing I thought notepad needed). I saw the new one still can&#39;t either, despite all its other kitchen-sink bloat.

You don&#39;t start a spy recruitment campaign by advertising it to the host.

Besides, USA and PRC are continuously trying to recruit in each others countries, just like the other major powers.

This sort of thing used to be done very subtly...it&#39;s generally not good practice to let your adversaries know you&#39;re actively recruiting fired subordinates, lest those subordinates &quot;commit suicide.&quot;

Demoralizing your enemy by making him more concerned about looking over his shoulder than paying attention to you is not a bad strategy.

Correct.  Xi is already hyperparanoid.  Nobody in the PLA command structure is truly safe.  Sowing a little discord could be advantageous.

You forget how bush-league is this alleged administration. They don&#39;t attract the top talent who know better than to work for bunch of numpties and knobs.

Nobody with the least bit of common sense would undertake anything that entails any kind of risk and assume that anyone involved in the current administration and management of the United States would be remotely capable of protecting their identity, let along doing the right thing.

The good and trustworthy people are all long gone.  And it&#39;ll take decades to rebuild, assuming it can be done at some point in the future.

Anyone remember that time that Hillary Clinton leaked the IDs of CIA spies in China to China and the CPC executed them all?No, because it didn&#39;t happen. There is no public record, evidence, or official accusation from the FBI, CIA, or Department of Justice linking her to that specific intelligence failure. Also, I think you meant the CCP instead of the CPC, but hey, gaslight on!

I stand duly corrected. Have been playing too much EVE Online probably :)

They refer to themselves In both ways but it&#39;s abbreviated, CCP.

I live in changshu China and it&#39;s better than dealing with you lot.

The alchol is cheap, as God intended. Giddy up, this is the year of the horse.

Trying to distract from the Jared-Kushner-is-a-foreign-asset news, I see.

oh it&#39;s numbers guy. The prolific Russian troll.

Trying to distract from Trump being an asset of Putin?

How has the US treated people who helped it during the war in Afghanistan? The UK screwed many of the over, with promises to protect then or help them come to the UK not being upheld.

Anyone would be a fool to think that their identity as an informant would be safe with the US government.

And just a few years ago, Chinese agencies compromised a CIA communication systems and obtained a list of spies working for the US.  They were all arrested and imprisoned and executed.  I don&#39;t know if you can call it &quot;murder&quot; when high treason is the one crime that still carries a death penalty even in countries like Australia that are mostly opposed to capital punishment.

Australia doesn&#39;t have the death penalty for anything.

The Commonwealth abolished capital punishment in the 70s, the last of the individual States the following decade.

Out of curiosity, what led you to say such a thing?

I thought there was some technicality that meant that the abolition of the death penalty didn&#39;t apply to treason.  Back in 2001 when Australian man David Hicks was captured apparently fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan, there were plenty of Australians calling for him to be charged with treason so he could face the death penalty.  I guess they were all misinformed?

Yeah, the Chinese military aren&#39;t that stupid. Being purged is unpleasant, but being executed is worse. And your children will probably be punished too.

A USA spy for the Soviet Union gave the entire list of soviet spies to them. All of them were murdered or died in a gulag.His name was Aldrich Ames [wikipedia.org].  He recently died [brave.com] (in prison).

Just watch a few white house briefings, that should be enough.

How long will the military stand by while Trump sits on his golden loo, shits on the American people and wipes his arse with constitution?

Ya, I am finishing up a stint at a very large organization and the experience has been eye-opening at how disposable staff is, especially when the sins of management is on the line.

And knowing what I know now, I would have tried my fortune elsewhere. It&#39;s not quite Kligon promotion (I&#39;ve manage to survive and I only have a modicum of social skills), but there is no doubt any continued employment isn&#39;t based on skills, aptitude, or even need but whatever astrology management is using this month.

Since AI tools can handle most routine coding tasks, the company’s junior software developers now spend less time on that and more time working with customers. In the HR department, entry-level staffers now spend time intervening when HR chatbots fall short, correcting output and talking to managers as needed, rather than fielding every question themselves.It certainly sounds like IBM wants people to fix broken shit code that AI barfs out. I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t have any native long-term consequences or anything. /s

&quot;tying up all the people who could fill those discarded roles&quot; Think scale. IBM isn&#39;t big enough to do this for even 5% of the talent out there for other companies to hire.

This is the definition of a reverse centaur.

It does. But that is not a job any junior person can handle competently.

So, basically, it is a push to hire more salespeople in the hope to sell the slop the &quot;AI&quot; is producing?

It means it this time! The hiring will triple from 3 to 9, and those 9 will be ex-interns who are kids of senior management.

Since H-1B&#39;s are harder to get nowadays, and opening offices in a bunch of countries isn&#39;t cheap (along with the employee-friendly/business-hostile employment laws outside of the USA) Hiring people just out of school might make some sense.

Now, in a few years&#39; time after the junior employees have groked all the tribal knowledge from the seasoned veterans, the seasoned veterans will be introduced to the IBM job cut guillotine just like they were during the great recession.

The lesson I learned when I was employed is that I should have changed employers more often. Staying put means seasoned veterans get screwed in their 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.

A recent study showed they make around 20 to 30% less than hiring locally and they also have fewer benefits.Cite?

They are hiring three interns instead of the previous one? Bravo!

IBM has been offshoring the fuck out of the company for the last decade or more. Domestic hiring is virtually non-existent.

IBM plans to reduce salaries 3x because people can just type stuff into Claude.

IBM needs to reload it&#39;s stock pile of people for their annual layoffs. That way their headcount remains the same at the end of the year and they can still grind up their quota of souls like usual.

In the early &#39;80s I had a friend who had a car which he would often be repairing. It was an old car even then. It was larger car of the time, probably a Holden. Everything mechanical was roomy. I remember him saying that you could probably open the bonnet, climb in and stand beside the engine. The engine was pretty simple, and had quite a bit of room for error. It was not precision engineering, but it worked, even if it wasn&#39;t finely tuned. Even though he wasn&#39;t a mechanic, his hobbyist knowledge allowed hi

IBM has historically hired most of the workforce right out of college and expected them to stay on indefinitely. Get a little too old and you get laid off. Its cheaper that way. So now they are hiring inexpensive labor to monitor the chatbots.

Ah, so they are setting themselves up for failure. No surprise. Because monitoring LLMs is a job that requires a lot of experience and insight.

While it was always clear to smart people, what this shows is that the core promises of the LLM-peddlers are simply one thing: Lies.

We&#39;ve been treated to ghosting after accepting a job offer. We&#39;ve had really unrealistic salary expectations - we&#39;ve had expectations of promotion to senior management positions in a few months. We&#39;ve had exceptional disrespect, and belief they they are now fully formed, and not only know more than the &quot;olde fartes&quot; All from people who have potential, but wild expectations for themselves.

There are many things for Europeans to worry about as they watch the Trump administration blow up the international order. There is the chaos of having international markets careening around the whims of one man. There is the ominous talk from an aggressive superpower lusting over Greenland. There is the catastrophic dismantling of efforts to rally the world to address the climate crisis.

But for certain European countries, Donald Trump poses a threat that taps into a more intimate and sickeningly primal fear: that Americans will force-feed them our disgusting chicken. Specifically, our “chlorine chicken,” Europe’s term for American chemically washed poultry.

“EXCLUSIVE: UK-US Trade Deal: Keep Your Chlorine Chicken America, Britain Must Not Pay This Price,” read one British headline from May. “Don’t Like the Idea of Chlorinated Chicken? You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet,” read another.

The panic over “chlorine chicken” is a noble British tradition that reappears every time the public considers the prospect of deepening its economic entanglement with the U.S. This particular European bogeyman dates back to 2014, when the U.S. and the European Union were negotiating a trans-Atlantic trade agreement. All the European countries shared the U.S. poultry aversion at the time: Germany calls it, we’re happy to report, chlorhühnchen. But the U.K. has more justification for its fears these days, as Brexit left its regulations more open to adjustment.

Now, the nation is in the grip of its latest chicken panic: British media have reported that the Trump administration is once again pressuring the U.K. to concede some of its food standards. In December, the Telegraph reported an alarming story with the headline “White House Demands British Supermarkets Stock Chlorinated Chicken.” According to the report, it all came down to a $40 billion technology agreement the White House had scrapped with the U.K. That failed deal was part of a cluster of agreements between the two nations meant to supplement the larger deal from May, which had excluded some economic sectors. The tech deal would have set terms for the nations’ collaboration over artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But in December, the White House quashed the deal, citing displeasure with the U.K.’s online safety rules, its digital services tax—and, strangely, food safety rules.

As the Telegraph described the negotiations, the U.S. trade envoy had been quite pointed about the food safety matter, particularly as it related to poultry and beef. Even though the deal had nothing to do with food, if the country wanted to revive it—something that promised significant investment from the U.S.—it would need to get over its squeamishness.

The British people don’t care for this. According to the British agricultural press, more than 150,000 Brits have since signed petitions urging their supermarket chains to “publicly rule out chlorinated chicken.” The angst lingers into the new year. It appears that the British public is realizing that fending the chlorine chicken off once doesn’t mean it won’t pop right back up as a matter of debate: As Trump has continued to toy with the global financial order, American unpredictability has changed the nature of this particularly British anxiety. No longer does the poultry panic emerge just for agricultural trade deals; Trump has made “chlorinated chicken” a permanent low-level threat, a dark, feathered cloud hovering over the British Isles. Thanks to Trump’s reputation for capriciousness, the great poultry panic may just be here to stay.

To be clear, “chlorine” is not a fully accurate word to describe American chicken; per the National Chicken Council, less than 5 percent of American chicken is treated with chlorine. Nowadays, the industry uses more effective cleaners, such as peracetic acid, a kind of all-purpose antimicrobial agent used in hospital cleaners, produce washes, and meat processing.

The data remain unclear as to whether the American method is actually that much worse, but the problem is more one of the general imagination: In the British mind, their chickens (and all other livestock) are dutifully cared for in sanitary, healthy conditions from birth to slaughter, keeping them disease-free from the start. Our chickens, on the other hand, are treated abominably, packed in tightly with their germy brethren, raised in squalor, pumped with hormones, and only made clean at the end. It’s a matter of washing off the filth—with unnatural chemicals, at that—versus never picking up the filth in the first place. This picture gives the Brits the heebie-jeebies. It’s not a fully accurate picture, as the British do still have factory farms, but it’s true that their standards for animal welfare are higher and that they don’t use nearly as many antibiotics. And it’s also true that their food safety philosophy about keeping away contamination at all stages is entirely different from the American fix-it-later mentality.

It was this cultural gag reflex that caused the specter of American chicken to become a major point of contention during Brexit, when people became worried the renegotiated trade deals would make their own food-safety attitudes vulnerable to assault from our population’s street-rat standards. Indeed, the U.S. tried: In 2019, BuzzFeed News reported that the first Trump administration was offering to pay up to $92,000 to have British journalists brought in on a tour of U.S. farms, with the goal of addressing “misconceptions” about chlorinated chicken.

The Brits warded off the American chicken then, but only after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the leader of the Labour Party a “gigantic chlorinated chicken.” Then, as now, everyone across all ideological lines feared the chicken; accusing political opponents of being soft on chlorine chicken is a legitimate attack. When Nigel Farage, a Trump ally, argued that the U.K. should allow chlorinated chicken (the British already ate questionable chicken from Thailand, he argued), it was a minor scandal. In 2023, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak solemnly vowed there would “be no chlorine-washed chicken and no hormone-treated beef on the U.K. market. Not now, not ever.”

But the Americans have fought for the chicken. Most recently, when the U.S. and U.K. negotiated a new trade deal last spring, the Trump White House did, indeed, try to bully the country into adjusting its food standards. The White House called them “non-science-based standards that severely restrict U.S. exports of safe, high-quality beef and poultry products.” (Headlines: “Trump Tells UK to Buy Their Chlorinated Chicken if They Want Tariff Relief.”) White House adviser Peter Navarro tried to assert that the Brits were missing out on a “very fine American agricultural product,” and “we don’t believe that once they taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to reassure the public that the government wouldn’t budge on this, and thanks to pressure from constituents, it didn’t.

But this bowel-clenching British fear didn’t simply disappear. Trump has continued to harangue the country about food standards, even after the Brits thought they’d struck a chlorine-free deal less than a year ago. And that’s the bigger problem: Alliances depend on trust, and the U.S. can no longer be trusted to keep its word—even when it comes to not forcing our icky chicken on Europeans.

The release of the Epstein files—the slow-drip revelations of a web of privileged (mostly) men trading gifts, access, favors, and sickening child predation as casually as Pokémon cards—has been deliberately parsed out through 2026 as to both be buried itself and bury other horrific news coming out of the Trump administration. But this misses a critical point: The Epstein file dump is not simply playing out as a backdrop against which other acts of American lawlessness are occurring. The Epstein story is also the template and the proof text for all that is happening in Minnesota; at dangerous detention centers; in efforts to punish members of Congress for lawful speech; for crypto scams; and for measles outbreaks. It is an ongoing road map for an administration that lives out the reality that they are rich and powerful and famous enough to be above the law each day, and wishes for the rest of us to ultimately learn and accept that fact.

So it follows that Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying blithely before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, as Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors sat behind her, unacknowledged and irrelevant to her purposes, is the template for that messaging: Blond woman who knows she must seek and maintain protection from this administration’s simulacrum of justice crows about the Dow Jones for the cameras, because she understands that if she doesn’t, she will be left behind, asking to be respected, like the masses of women behind her.

And it is equally true that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bring his children and their nannies to a bespoke lunch on Epstein’s island in 2012, long after he allegedly broke off contact with the sex predator, precisely because Lutnick’s children and their nannies were not the types of children or women who would be abandoned there to be raped and threatened. He is also a walking infomercial about whom the law protects and whom it leaves broken and invisible, behind. Lutnick’s testimony this past week, like Bondi’s, is thus operating as a still life in what happens when the law becomes inert. On the one hand, it is not relevant as a restraint to those who need not rely on it; on the other, it is not protective for those who do.

Liz Plank, on her Substack, describes the nausea and disorientation felt by women realizing this past week that we had all been gaslit yet again. Those of us who cannot even begin to imagine a permission structure that allowed and encouraged passing young girls around, trading insults and articles about them (“your littlest girl was a little naughty”), and bonding over the hysteria of #MeToo can barely comprehend why it was that this class of men always took the gift and the freebie and the shitty watch and the plane trip, because access to yet more of the same somehow became the coin of the realm. What Plank describes as “trust bias”—the psychological tendency to assume that others are operating within the same moral and ethical universe as yourself—means that we are all, once again, annihilated by the fact that America’s shared moral universe is a collective fiction, one that constrains one class of people and merely titillates another.

We err when we call what is being done by ICE officials to citizens and noncitizens on the streets of American cities “law,” just as we err when we call what has thus far been afforded the Epstein survivors “justice.” Indeed, the word law is too generous to contain the plea deals and the willing ignorance and the prison transfers that were granted to Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators at every turn. And the word injustice is far too small to describe the spectacle of hundreds of survivors who have still not been given a reckoning or a measure of genuine accountability, whose unredacted names appeared in public documents and who had never been contacted by the Department of Justice.

Pam Bondi may be in charge of many officials and many investigations and many legal things at the DOJ, but what she is protecting is neither justice nor law. And that means that what Plank describes as a trust bias is also an exquisitely American “law bias,” and we should dispense with the notion that we are all in some group compact to protect and preserve the same things. The law is neither protecting the vulnerable nor constraining the Epstein class. And perhaps we should stop referencing that word to mean either project, much less deploying it to describe both.

What Bondi, and Donald Trump, and Lutnick, and Todd Blanche are doing under the banner of law and law enforcement and pardons and immunity and impunity is an operatic performance of a single truth: The “law” will now protect those who are within the network of favors and privilege and secrets and side-eyes and snickers and abuse of young girls, and the “law” will also abandon those who are not. What Bondi did this week under the bright lights of the U.S. Congress was to personify that the law is a word for the thing that is “weaponized” when it’s used against the president, and is the thing that is bestowed benignly on those who seek his grace. This is a protection racket, and we are being conditioned in plain sight to recognize that it protects itself and it preys on everyone who refuses to buckle.

This isn’t to say that the law is meaningless. Judges across the country prove every day that the law is still the last, best guardrail against that sort of nihilist thinking. But the attorney general’s performance was an hourslong spectacle enacted solely to highlight who lives above the law and who must beg it for scraps. We should probably stop calling this law and call it simply “power.” Just as we could stop calling Bondi the AG and call her Trump’s constitutional Roomba. We should almost certainly stop calling the Epstein survivors anything other than the legal heroes and dreamers they are.

On Wednesday, I went for a walk outside around a lake near my home. I didn’t wear a mask. I could see, clearly, the buildings on the other side. I came home feeling happy and invigorated.

This doesn’t sound like much, but I live in Hanoi, Vietnam, a city that frequently ranks as one of the world’s most polluted. It is an incredible place to live: culturally vibrant, wonderfully optimistic, with notoriously excellent food. But when it’s “pollution season”—roughly October to March—too much time outdoors and without a mask means headaches, an itchy throat, and sore lungs, not to mention an elevated risk of everything from asthma to dementia to various cancers. On Wednesday, we had a rare afternoon where the Air Quality Index was below 100. The air quality on my app was yellow, or moderate—not even the elusive green, which signals good air—but in a Hanoi winter, yellow is a gift.

By the time I went on my only-moderately-polluted walk, I had already been assigned to write a column about the Trump administration’s obliteration of efforts to fight climate change. I was mulling how incredible it is that Americans live in a wealthy, developed, incredibly prosperous nation; that we generally enjoy clean water, clean land, and clean air, and even clean air in our largest cities; that we enjoy that level of cleanliness in large part thanks to the environmental movement and the many rules and regulations environmentally conscious politicians have put into place; and that there are right-wing American activists who have dedicated their careers to undoing all of it—and there’s a large contingent of American voters who support them.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, run by climate change denialists and people who seem oddly hostile to the environment they are in charge of protecting, is revoking the “endangerment finding,” a ruling that underpins much of the government’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The endangerment finding operates under the Clean Air Act, and to be clear, that law has not yet been revoked (although they would if they could). But overturning the endangerment finding undermines the law’s ability to do anything about climate change—and it’s hard to overstate just how devastating this deregulation will be for the planet. Scientists are unified in the understanding that pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the earth, which in turn drives natural disasters, drought, disease, flooding, and even war.

The fight isn’t over. Environmental and public health groups will immediately sue to protect the (glaringly obvious) finding that the propellants of catastrophic climate change do indeed present a risk to public health. But the administration is ready to take their case to a very deregulation-friendly and Trump-favoring Supreme Court. They’re seeking a quick result so that they can take a sledgehammer not just to environmental regulations, but to the federal government’s very ability to impose environmental regulations—making it harder, if not impossible, for future Democratic presidents to take decisive action on the environment. “They want to not just do what other Republican administrations have done, which is weaken regulations,” Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program head Jody Freeman told the New York Times. “They want to take the federal government out of the business of regulation, period.”

This is par for the course from an administration that is hostile not just to efforts to fight climate change, but to the kind of green energy that will power the future—and that is already powering the present in much of the world. Renewables are overtaking coal and gas, and the market for green energy is exploding. There are enormous economic opportunities here, ones that President Joe Biden put America on the path to enjoying; before Trump took office, many people, especially in red states, were already cashing in. Trump has walked back many of these gains, squandering billions of dollars.

You might have read about the dystopia of super-polluted cities like Delhi, where the city always seems to be shrouded in dust, and you don’t see the sun for days. But here, I think the evenings are the strangest. The streetlights illuminate what looks like fog, and you can see little particles of dust and debris swirling around. I always think: Oh, that’s going directly into my lungs.

My days are set by my AQI app. I prefer to work in my favorite café down the street—Hanoi has famously exceptional coffee culture—but it doesn’t run air purifiers, and so if the AQI is dangerously high, I stay home. On the few times I have risked it, I’ve come home nauseous, and with a pounding headache, itchy red eyes, and lungs that feel inflamed and like they won’t quite fill up all the way. The app I use has a little cartoon person to illustrate each level of danger. On green days, he smiles. On yellow (moderate) days, he’s neutral; orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) days, he frowns; red (unhealthy) he wears a mask; purple (very unhealthy) he dons a respirator; and when it’s maroon (hazardous), he has on an even more serious respirator and looks extremely alarmed—this means the AQI is over 300, “a health warning of emergency conditions,” which means that “the entire population is likely to be severely affected,” according to the IQAir app. (I keep New York on my AQI app too: It’s almost always green.)

People in Hanoi aren’t living like this for fun. Vietnam is something of an economic miracle, with a stunning rate of economic growth. It has rapidly industrialized, which has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty. Those people then buy motorbikes, build houses, and work in newly constructed factories (go ahead and check how many of your most recent Amazon orders, whatever they were, were made in Vietnam). Pollution from the traffic, factories, and construction is all severe; the benefits of all of these things are also extraordinary in a country that was ravaged by war just a few decades ago. There are certainly ways for countries to develop sustainably; it seems questionable whether there are ways for countries to rapidly industrialize and develop at a cheetah’s pace and not seriously degrade the environment in the process. Here, though, the calculus is complex. Yes, the air pollution is horrible, and kills some 60,000 people every year. But in the early 1990s, close to four in five Vietnamese households were living in extreme poverty. Now, extreme poverty is inching toward zero. That is even more life-saving.

And while it’s far from perfect, the government here is in fact trying to implement environmental regulations to protect the country’s diverse ecology, clean up the air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Americans are not living under a similar calculus. We don’t have to choose between economic prosperity and a livable country (not to mention a livable planet). We can move toward even greater prosperity by investing in future-forward clean energy sources. We can be good stewards of a spectacular country, with its plains and canyons and mountains and deserts, as well as its vibrant cities.

At this moment, however, we’re simply choosing not to. Trump has said he supports clean air but not efforts to address climate change, but the two are inextricable. The move from fossil fuels to green energy is not only a must for greenhouse gas reduction, it’s a huge part of reducing the kind of conventional pollutants that continue to degrade our air quality—and our lungs.

A small handful of people are making a whole lot of money in sticking with the old dirty energy sources. This administration has intentionally set back progress on wind and solar projects, as well as on the electric vehicles that much of the world is transitioning over to, in order to prop up a few wealthy tycoons at the expense of the rest of us. And of course the burdens are not felt equally. This is certainly true where I live: I have the resources to buy good air purifiers, a job that lets me work from home, the money to take a taxi rather than a motorbike if I want to get somewhere, and the knowledge of the dangers and how to mitigate them (for example: burning through half a dozen rolls of winterizing tape to seal every door and window so less of the bad air can get in). That’s not the case for huge swaths of the population here, and certainly not for the people whose entire livelihoods revolve around dealing with the trash and pollutants that are the cost of development. In the U.S., low-income residents, as well as Black, Latino, and Asian Americans, are disproportionately exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than white and wealthier Americans, which contributes to illness and premature death. Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” is notorious for industrial pollution that lays waste to the human population—and the people who live closest to the industrial plants tend to be Black and poor.

Even with this decimation of environmental regulations, America’s largest cities are unlikely to regularly find themselves on the most-polluted lists. But the air pollution you can see is far from the only risk to your health, your community, other human beings, and the future of life on our planet. As someone who checks the AQI like it’s the weather, I am genuinely, profoundly flummoxed by those who invite in environmental degradation and the destruction of what makes so much of this world so beautiful—and who, in the name of politics or profit, are so willing to burn the future.

With great fanfare last summer, House and Senate Republicans approved $45 billion to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention capacity as part of their signature catchall bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This exorbitant amount—one of many line items in the bill’s historic ramp-up of immigration enforcement funding—was considered an easy part of the bill to pass. Republicans didn’t fight over it. Democrats, still angsty after the 2024 election about looking soft on immigration, didn’t call much attention to it.

But now that this network of massive detention centers—large-scale holding centers for people awaiting deportation—is being constructed, the reaction from Republicans is: Not in my backyard.

From Maryland and Virginia to Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Arizona, and everywhere in between, massive warehouses that the Department of Homeland Security is purchasing to convert into detention centers are being met with fierce resistance. It should go without saying that Democratic officials, who’ve recently rediscovered their courage in opposing Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement plans, don’t want 1,500-to-10,000-bed cogs in Trump’s deportation machine within their jurisdictions—or anyone else’s. But it’s the pushback from national Republican electeds, who voted enthusiastically to construct this apparatus just last summer, that’s especially notable. They’re not protesting on behalf of the detainees, or rejecting the administration’s vision. All are quick to point out that they adore the goals of this project. But if you try to place a piece of this infrastructure in their communities, well, someone in the administration is going to get an earful.

The words of Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker rejecting an ICE detention center in his state‍—‍“While I support the enforcement of immigration law, I write to express my opposition to this acquisition and the proposed detention center”—are beginning to read like a form letter.

The administration is doing more than just buying up some vacant space here or there. It’s creating a new model for processing, holding, and deporting people in its custody. In this hub-and-spoke system, “smaller” (still enormous) warehouses would be used as roughly 1,500-bed processing sites that feed into larger, 5,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, from which deportations would be staged. This would achieve the administration’s goals of deporting immigrants more efficiently and at greater scale. If this sounds like an Amazon distribution system, that’s by design. In the immortal 2025 words of Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, the deportation machine should be like “Prime, but with human beings.”

Ever since proposed locations for these warehouse purchases were published a couple of months ago, and coinciding with the sharp decline in ICE’s public image following a pair of killings in Minnesota, local pushback has been strong. Municipal meetings overflow with complaints, and local officials do what they can to push back. On the same January day ICE was spotted touring a building in Kansas City for a detention center, for example, the city council passed a resolution banning nonmunicipal detention centers for five years, though the fight goes on. A Canadian developer who owned a warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, that DHS was looking to purchase took the property off the market following public outcry. The owners of another warehouse in Oklahoma City, similarly, cut off talks with DHS. The Oklahoma City mayor, in a Facebook post, wrote that “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City.”

That mayor is a Republican. A lot of these local officials at the 23 sites DHS is eyeing are Republicans. Their concerns don’t necessarily touch on the humanity of what ICE is doing, or present a conscientious case against the erection of a mass prison network. Instead, the arguments are more about disruptions to communities that aren’t situated to handle this—and weren’t given opportunities to explain this before DHS proceeded. And those complaints from local Republicans have fed up to their Republican national officials.

In his Feb. 4 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Wicker laid out his case against a proposed ICE detention center in Byhalia, Mississippi. It covers most of the points that other Republicans, in similar situations, have been making.

Wicker argued that the location was “positioned for economic development purposes” and that “converting this industrial asset into an ICE detention center forecloses economic growth opportunities and replaces them with a use that does not generate comparable economic returns or community benefits.” Further, mass detention facilities put strains on local resources (“transportation access, water, sewer and energy costs, staffing, medical care, and emergency services”), as human beings have needs that Amazon Prime packages do not. Last, Wicker pointed to “public safety” concerns from the community. Understandably so, given that the Trump administration has sold its enforcement regime as necessary because undocumented immigrants are hardened killers from mental institutions.

“I look forward to your prompt response,” Wicker concluded, and then pointedly reminded her to “keep me informed of this acquisition and any future ICE contracting proposals affecting the state of Mississippi.” Wicker noted shortly thereafter that Noem told him she would search for a new location.

Not everyone has been so lucky. DHS has made successful acquisitions despite similar concerns elsewhere. DHS closed on a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona, late last month, paying $70 million in cash, much to the, well, surprise of the local government. This earned a rebuke not just from Democratic senators or state leaders, but from Rep. Paul Gosar, a far-right member of Congress who was vehemently anti-immigration before it was cool. In a Feb. 4 letter to Noem, Gosar—after a few paragraphs of throat-clearing about his strong support for ICE—asked 15 questions about how the hell Surprise, Arizona, is expected to absorb this, and why the city wasn’t consulted about it at all.

The small town of Social Circle, Georgia, with a population of about 5,000 people, also recently learned that it, against its wishes, would be getting an ICE detention facility that could double or triple its population in a matter of months. (It’s not hard to find the specific warehouses. Do a map search of the town name, and it’s usually the biggest rectangular structure.) The retrofitted warehouse could begin receiving detainees by April. This prompted Social Circle’s congressman, Mike Collins, a MAGA social media gadfly who’s now running for Senate, to pipe up.

“Although I am aligned with the mission of ICE to detain and deport the criminal illegal aliens who have flooded across our border due to Joe Biden’s reckless policies,” Collins wrote on Facebook earlier this month, “I agree with the community that Social Circle does not have the sufficient resources that this facility would require.”

These are just a few examples. There’s bipartisan opposition to a proposed processing facility in Chester, New York. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who didn’t vote for the OBBBA but is certainly Democrats’ most pro-immigration-enforcement senator, wrote his own letter of complaint to Noem about two facilities reportedly under consideration for Pennsylvania. The offices of Texas’ two Republican senators didn’t respond with their positions regarding three facilities reportedly eyed for their state—though Sen. John Cornyn’s office passed along floor remarks noting his support for funding DHS and ICE—and neither did the offices of Missouri’s two Republican senators regarding the proposed Kansas City megawarehouse.

DHS, too, did not respond for comment about the pushback, and whether it had adequately discussed its purchase plans with stakeholders.

The lack of consultation across the map, though, doesn’t look like an oversight. This is how White House policy chief Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation agenda, runs his government: Act fast because time is ticking, and deal with—or steamroll past—individual complaints after the fact. It does not take a genius to understand that members or senators might vote for one thing and then complain when it threatens to overwhelm their local sewer systems, or places detention camps within a mile of elementary schools. “Mass deportation” as a slogan to rev up the base was one thing; in practice, every step of the process‍—‍from the mass deployments of agents to the construction of detention—burns enthusiasm for the project. The administration is doing what it can, as quickly as it can, before the luster is gone altogether.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear-powered datacenters in the US are moving closer as a consortium prepares to build proposed facilities for the Department of Energy (DoE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

At the end of 2025, nuclear developer Deep Atomic submitted its proposal to the DoE to build what it calls the &quot;nation&#39;s first nuclear-powered AI and HPC datacenter campus,&quot; at INL, where commercial nuclear power was pioneered.

While there are already datacenters next to atomic power stations, such as the Cumulus facility in Pennsylvania, now owned by Amazon, the Deep Atomic project aims to build a campus with its own dedicated power plant.

This follows moves by the DoE to colocate datacenters with energy generation facilities on federal land, spurred on by executive orders issued by President Donald Trump about removing barriers to AI development and the energy needed to power it.

The consortium around Deep Atomic includes another nuclear firm, Paragon Energy Solutions, datacenter engineering biz Future-tech, and AI infrastructure firm Moonlite.

Now real estate biz Clayco says that it is providing delivery planning on how the datacenter campus should be designed, engineered, and constructed, to further inform the DoE submission process.

The firm will advise the consortium on aligning design and construction approaches with the operational requirements of running high-density AI workloads.

&quot;Our team is proud to support Deep Atomic and the broader consortium by bringing real-world datacenter delivery experience and execution discipline to help present a buildable, delivery-ready proposal for this groundbreaking, first-of-kind project,&quot; commented Clayco founder and executive chairman Bob Clark.

If the project gets approval, construction is planned to proceed on a phased approach. The datacenter will be completed first, and Deep Atomic hopes operations will commence within 24 to 36 months, using existing grid, geothermal, and solar power already available at the INL site.

The AI compute infrastructure will thus be up and running while Deep Atomic puts its MK60 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) through design certification, fabrication, and commissioning.

Or, as a cynic might put it, the datacenter will still function, even if the SMR turns out to be a dud.

Deep Atomic claims that its MK60 unit will be able to provide 60 MW of behind-the-meter electrical power, but also 60 MW of cooling capacity – a feature designed specifically for AI and HPC datacenters, according to the firm.

We asked Deep Atomic when it expects both the datacenter and atomic plant to be operating, but the answer is likely to be &quot;several years from now.&quot;

&quot;In the nuclear world the game starts very early as there is still a fairly long runway before the realization of SMR or microreactor regulatory approval, availability at scale, and adoption in a broad commercial sense,&quot; Omdia principal analyst for Colocation and DC Building Alan Howard told The Register.

He added that he expected to see the end game of this happening around 2035, but &quot;I hope I&#39;m wrong and it&#39;s sooner.&quot;

Last year, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed his belief that the country would have at least one SMR up and running by July 2026.

A stand-alone nuclear power source serving a stand-alone datacenter with no grid interconnection is &quot;a common vision and likely to come true in the future,&quot; according to Howard, but he said the power delivery market is &quot;evolving and exceedingly complex so how it actually plays out could be quite different.&quot;

&quot;At the end of the day, who knows where we will be on datacenter AI capacity demand in five years; the market is changing quarterly and is so dynamic it&#39;s impossible to get a solid view on the future.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ring has cut ties with Flock, citing resource constraints, mere months after the pair announced a partnership.

The pair spoke of their intention to work together on Ring&#39;s Community Requests feature back in October, but Ring said this week the integration &quot;would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.&quot;

The Amazon-owned smart home company made no mention of it in the announcement, but the cancellation comes at a tricky time following backlash over its recent Super Bowl ad.

Ring had used its 30-second slot to highlight its AI-powered Search Party feature, which recruits Ring devices in a neighborhood to activate when someone triggers a lost pet alert. All the devices switch on to locate the animal and reunite it with their owner.

It&#39;s a cute idea in theory, but when depicted in video, many viewers said they saw Search Party as dystopian, and questioned whether this technology could be used for more nefarious means.

While there&#39;s no suggestion the cancellation is linked to this, it also follows another recently announced (and banned by a few states) Ring facial recognition feature, as well as recent criticism leveled at Flock by privacy rights org EFF over its license plate recognition system.

Flock manufactures video cameras, gunshot and audio detectors, and license plate readers, all of which are widely used by US police forces. Recent reports also indicate that this leads to database searches that inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity.

It should be said that Flock recently addressed these concerns, saying that it has no partnerships with ICE or the Department of Homeland Security, and that ICE does not have direct access to Flock-captured footage.

However, the American Civil Liberties Union previously pointed out, citing a 404 Media probe, that many police searches of Flock camera footage are carried out on behalf of ICE agents.

That reportedly includes ICE agents working for the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, which has been violently arresting suspected illegal immigrants on the streets of the US for months by order of President Trump. The same ICE officers have been linked to multiple killings following detention attempts under the division&#39;s orders.

Ring assured customers that none of its video footage was ever sent to Flock between the initial partnership announcement and this week, when that deal was folded up.

It stated: &quot;Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration. The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

&quot;At Ring, our mission has always been to make neighborhoods safer. That mission comes with significant responsibility – to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.&quot;

Flock said that an engagement period, during which the two companies consulted customers, public officials, and communities about expectations regarding accountability, transparency, and lawful use, led to the decision.

&quot;Technology plays a powerful role in helping communities prevent and solve crime,&quot; said Garrett Langley, founder and CEO at Flock Safety. &quot;But that impact only matters if it strengthens trust and aligns with local community expectations.

&quot;Our priority is ensuring that every tool we build and deploy reflects the standards our customers and their communities expect. Right now, that means staying focused on local innovation and disciplined, responsible growth.&quot;

Ring said that it still plans to push on with Community Requests, a feature that allows customers to share footage with law enforcement if they issue a request. Customers are free to ignore these.

Announced in September 2025, Community Requests followed the January 2024 shuttering of Ring&#39;s Request for Assistance (RFA) feature. They&#39;re both very similar, allowing police to request footage from users, with the main difference being that Community Requests involves Axon for secure evidence handling.

Footage goes to Axon, which hands it over to law enforcement, provided the request comes with some information about why it was made.

If the partnership went ahead, Flock would have been the second third-party company to handle Community Requests after Axon – an intermediary between user footage and public safety organizations. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI bubble continues to inflate with Anthropic&#39;s announcement of $30 billion in Series G funding at a $380 billion post-money valuation.

The figures offer insight into the mentality of investors in AI platforms. Anthropic, like its rival OpenAI, has yet to turn a profit, although there are hopes that it will do so any moment now. Investors continue to surf a wave of expected returns. The outfit is heavily burning cash to fund AI model development — and has made billions in headline compute and infrastructure commitments.

Anthropic began generating revenue less than three years ago. Its announcement said: &quot;Today, our run-rate revenue is $14 billion, with this figure growing over 10x annually in each of those past three years.&quot;

A chunk of that is being driven by Claude Code, the company&#39;s agentic coding model. The company stated that business subscriptions to the service have quadrupled since the start of 2026, and enterprise usage accounts for more than half of all Claude Code revenue.

According to a February report, 4 percent of GitHub public commits are authored by Claude Code. The same report optimistically reckons that Claude Code will account for more than 20 percent of daily commits by the end of 2026.

Such projections warrant caution. Developers are unlikely to surrender production workloads – or even personal projects – to machine-generated code without debate. The bigger question is what Anthropic will ultimately need to charge to deliver returns for investors.

Then there is code quality. Recently, Anthropic&#39;s Claude Opus 4.6 spent $20K to produce a partly functional C compiler. A researcher characterized the resulting Rust as &quot;reasonable&quot; but &quot;nowhere near&quot; expert level.

Ads won&#39;t bolster the company&#39;s revenues in the same way as planned by its rivals. Anthropic has committed to keeping advertising out of the Claude model family, even as it has run marketing campaigns joking about the idea of inserting ads into chatbot conversations.

That said, OpenAI is unlikely to be too worried about Anthropic&#39;s barbs. Last year, it achieved a nominal value of $500 billion, a figure that could hit $750 billion or more in 2026. As 2025 drew to a close, SoftBank announced it had invested another $22.5 billion in the company. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">United Launch Alliance&#39;s Vulcan Centaur reached orbit on February 12 despite &quot;a significant performance anomaly&quot; that saw one of its four solid rocket boosters burn through its nozzle during ascent.

Viewers of the launch from Cape Canaveral at 0422 EST (0922 UTC) were treated to some impressive fireworks as the part detached in a shower of fragments.

It was the fourth launch of ULA&#39;s replacement for the Atlas V and Delta IV rocket, and the second in which an anomaly was noted with the booster. A nozzle was shed during the second launch of the rocket in 2024 in a configuration featuring twin solid rocket boosters, although all appeared to go well on the third in 2025.

Despite the anomaly, the mission was a success, and the US Space Force payload was carried directly to geosynchronous orbit.

ULA planned to ramp up Vulcan Centaur operations in 2026, with future launches including payloads for Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper). It is not clear if those will need to be postponed while ULA investigates the cause of the burn-through and subsequent loss of at least part of the rocket nozzle.

Gary Wentz, ULA vice president of Atlas and Vulcan Programs, said in a statement: &quot;We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission.&quot;

The Vulcan Centaur is a heavy-lift vehicle, with a pair of Blue Origin BE-4 engines powering the first stage and up to six GEM 63XL solid rocket boosters providing additional thrust.

The anomaly caused asymmetric thrust, which the rest of the rocket counteracted, allowing it to deliver the payload as planned.

ULA was not the only company launching a new-ish rocket on February 12. Arianespace conducted the launch of the first four-booster configuration of its Ariane 6 rocket at 1645 UTC. The launch went ahead without incident and the rocket deposited 32 Amazon Leo satellites into orbit. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! As if to demonstrate that whatever one operating system can do, Windows can do it better, bluer, and upside down, we present a bus stopping only at bork.

Today&#39;s example of signage woes - thanks to reader Spike - comes from a Nottingham bus, headed for Recovery (though hopefully the right way up).

According to an eagle-eyed Register reader, the screen normally shows the next few stops, but now it is only displaying a baleful blue screen and a warning that Windows is very unhappy about something.

&quot;Your PC/Device needs to be repaired&quot; is not the message a bus&#39;s passengers expect to see.

Upside down Windows recovery screen on a Nottingham bus

Nottingham is a city in the English county of Nottinghamshire and, aside from various tales of Robin Hood-based exploits, is also notable for being the home of the oldest professional football (soccer) club in the English Football League, Notts County.

The display on the bus is quite a bit more up to date, with a recovery screen that looks like something thrown up by Windows 10. The 0xc000000e might be something to do with a Boot Configuration Data file, possibly as a result of a failing or disconnected drive.

While any Register reader worth their IT credentials will have a repair disk to hand, hunting for a suitable port on a bus is likely to be frowned upon by the operator.

And then there is the question of why the display is upside down. Ease of cable routing? Or, more likely, a reflection because the screen is mounted elsewhere. Whatever the reason, orientation can easily be handled in software. However, a tumble into Recovery mode has shown things as they really are. Windows is upside down.

Destination Recovery, or a jaunt to the Upside Down from Netflix drama Stranger Things, is unlikely to be a place the passengers want to go. Windows, it seems, has other ideas. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Britain&#39;s state-backed savings bank has been dragged over the coals by Parliament&#39;s spending watchdog, which has branded its long-running digital overhaul a £3 billion &quot;full-spectrum disaster.&quot;

In a report published on Friday, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) delivered a scathing review of National Savings & Investments&#39; (NS&I) years-long digital transformation effort, saying the project continues to expose taxpayers to &quot;unacceptable risks.&quot;

The project, once cheerfully branded &quot;Project Rainbow,&quot; was intended to modernize NS&I&#39;s aging infrastructure, reduce operational costs, and improve services for millions of customers. Instead, it has become a case study on how government modernization projects can spiral out of control when complexity is underestimated.

PAC chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown wasted little time setting the tone. &quot;NS&I&#39;s original name for its troubled digital modernization effort was Project Rainbow,&quot; he said. &quot;It is perhaps unsurprising that this upbeat name for the scheme was retired as aptly our report finds it has been a full-spectrum disaster.&quot;

That tone continues throughout the report. MPs say the program has yet to deliver the promised new services and still lacks a fully integrated, credible plan outlining next steps, a timeline, and costs.

Estimates put the full cost of the overhaul at roughly £3 billion as of 2024, reflecting delays and the fact that NS&I is still running parts of the legacy infrastructure the project was meant to replace. Contracts supporting those systems have already been extended to 2028, underlining how far the transformation still has to go.

Clifton-Brown contrasted that figure with the Bank of England&#39;s renewal of its Real-Time Gross Settlement system, delivered on schedule for £431 million. What&#39;s more, when MPs asked how much had been spent on the transformation to date, NS&I couldn&#39;t provide a figure.

The bank told the PAC it believed it had &quot;the right data,&quot; but was having difficulty extracting and presenting it from its own systems. Which is not the sort of answer you expect from a financial institution entrusted with managing tens of billions in public savings.

&quot;It is deeply worrying to see a project in such an important organisation so off-track that neither this Committee, or at times the Treasury itself, could gain an accurate sounding on costs and progress,&quot; Clifton-Brown said.

None of this fell apart overnight. The trouble started the moment NS&I tried to pry apart banking systems that have been glued together over decades. These systems sit underneath most of its day-to-day operations, including customer accounts, payments, and internal record-keeping, which has made the overhaul harder than originally expected.

Unsurprisingly, the vision of switching off the old platform and moving to something new has been deferred. In a letter to the PAC last month, NS&I said it is reassessing the program and considering scaling it back, including loosening how deeply new technology integrates with the legacy estate.

The shift highlights how difficult the transformation has been to execute, and staffing hasn&#39;t helped matters, according to the PAC. MPs were told NS&I spent about £43 million on consultants while pushing the overhaul forward, which Clifton-Brown says was due to the bank lacking the in-house expertise needed when the program began.

Then there is the internal culture. When MPs asked whether people inside NS&I had been too positive about progress, leadership described a &quot;can-do&quot; environment. Clifton-Brown said the organization has remained &quot;bullishly confident&quot; amid scrutiny, but said its delivery record does not exactly back that up.

He summed it up with a line that is unlikely to disappear anytime soon, suggesting the program so far looks closer to &quot;can&#39;t do.&quot;

Treasury oversight also gets a fairly sharp nudge in the report. MPs said that by the time the program was reset in 2024, delays were already entrenched and costs had well exceeded early projections.

The PAC now wants NS&I to produce what sounds like the government equivalent of going back to the drawing board. A proper plan, built from scratch rather than reverse-engineered around optimistic delivery dates, that includes clearer cost reporting and actual evidence that risks are being tracked and handled.

Until the organization produces a credible recovery plan with realistic timelines and cost controls, the PAC warned, taxpayers remain exposed to the risk that Project Rainbow&#39;s pot of gold may never materialize. ®

It’s been a long road to release for Mewgenics developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel.

When the Mewgenics team announced in 2024 that it had added autism to the list of disorders the game’s cats could inherit, developer Edmund McMillen — best known as the co-creator of Super Meat Boy — was unprepared for the reaction.

“It was like the most positive response I’ve ever had to anything I posted,” he says. On Reddit and TikTok, fans expressed gratitude and excitement for the inclusion. “Everybody was like, ‘This is the perfect representation for autism. I feel seen,’ etc., etc.,” McMillen says. “That felt like somebody opened the door and said, ‘Go on. Go ahead, do your thing.’”

Mewgenics, which launched for PC on February 10th, is the year’s first surprise indie hit. Announced in 2013, it was originally a Team Meat title from McMillen and Tommy Refenes; McMillen saved the project after it was put on hiatus. A darkly funny and deceptively complex combo of adorable characters, roguelike gameplay, and tactical roleplaying, Mewgenics is, as the pun in its name suggests, a game about breeding and bloodlines. It’s currently Steam’s top-selling game this week. Co-creator Tyler Glaiel told IGN it took less than three hours to recoup development costs, while McMillen tells The Verge the game is already expected to top 500,000 units sold. “It’s blown past anything I’ve ever done by a mile,” he says.

The game’s arrival in 2026, when misinformation about disorders like autism is rampant and pro-eugenics attitudes abound, is eerily topical, albeit accidental. McMillen, to be clear, has not created an intentional commentary on the state of the world. “I hate politics,” he says. “It’s a game about cats fucking, you know what I mean?”

There is a deluge of mutations and disorders cats can inherit in the game — from bad gas or kidney stones to ADHD and depression — that impact their stats. ADHD gives players only seconds to make decisions or the cat will start acting on its own. Autism includes accelerated intelligence but lower charisma; the cat will be naturally very good at the abilities they’re born with, but other skills might be a little more difficult. “I’m very well versed in this,” McMillen says. “I have two children that are on the spectrum, and I have a wife who is as well. … It has been a big part of my life for the past 10 years.”

“I want people to play and read between the lines.”

Mewgenics includes over 100 disorders — name one, McMillen says, and it’s probably in the game — but each has its own silver lining. The point isn’t to immediately dump cats with certain disorders, but to appreciate them. “I want people to play and read between the lines,” McMillen says. “I want you to have a cat with autism, and instead of throwing it away, realizing its strengths and embracing the challenge and potential that that cat would have.”

Mewgenics is a personal project for McMillen, one that haunted him for years when it was unfinished. “I fell in love with the characters, and I fell in love with the world, and I fell in love with the things that I thought were interesting and fun about the genetic aspect of it,” McMillen says. The game’s road to release has been over a decade in the making; following their success with Super Meat Boy, he originally conceived the project with Refenes. While the original project was about cat breeding and the genetics involved, McMillen says, it wasn’t actually much of a game. “It was like a toy, a little idle game where you would breed your cats, and then you’d use your cats in minigames,” McMillen says.

After 18 months of development and a public showing at PAX, however, McMillen says that Refenes’ enthusiasm for the project had waned. “It was very apparent that I was the only person that wanted to continue working on the project,” McMillen says. “And I can’t force somebody to just continue to work on something.” The pair decided to put the project on pause to work on another Super Meat Boy project.

To McMillen’s surprise, he received an email from Steam expressing condolences about the game’s cancellation. After talking with Refenes, McMillen says, it became clear that Mewgenics would never happen while he worked at Team Meat. When McMillen left Team Meat in 2016, he took Mewgenics with him.

After teaming up with Glaiel, the two spent another six years reworking it into the massive game it exists as today; Glaiel did extensive amounts of research into breeding — and inbreeding — to work out the finer points of the game’s main mechanic. Felines can be any sexuality, and how their relationships progress is sometimes out of the player’s hands. “They can be very passive,” McMillen says. “They can have rivals. They can fall in love. They can be rejected.” Online, he’s said the game will take most players over 200 hours to finish.

Writing Mewgenics has made McMillen regard some of his previous work differently. He points specifically to The Binding of Isaac and its themes on nature versus nurture and “how nurture can really fuck a kid up.” Some struggles in life, however, are inherited.

“The game definitely became more about children — the experience of raising children,” McMillen says, reflecting on how fatherhood changed his view of the game from its inception to release. “The legacy that you leave, and the genetics that you pass to them and curse them with. I started to write more from that perspective.”

﻿The math isn’t really in your favor, especially with the frequent discounts on HP laptops.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

There’s been some hullabaloo over HP’s laptop subscription service, recently brought to light by a Linus Tech Tips video. And for good reason: it feels like everything is a subscription these days. But it’s not just the dystopian feeling that companies are happy to sell you access to movies, music, games, phones, printers, and now even laptops without you actually owning them. HP’s subscriptions for its consumer and gaming laptop lines are just a bad deal.

HP offers subscriptions for four productivity laptops and four gaming laptops, starting at $34.99 per month and $49.99 per month, respectively. There’s no starting fee or down payment, just a soft credit check. Each laptop subscription includes a coverage plan with 24/7 support from a live agent, and you can upgrade to a new model after 12 months. That last part is the service’s most appealing feature. You’ll never own this laptop (you can’t even buy out your lease), but you can be on the cutting edge with a new computer every year, if that’s important to you.

HP has a nice-sounding trial period, allowing you to cancel in the first 30 days with a full refund. But beyond that, you’re paying for a full year even if you cancel. End your $130/month subscription for the Omen Max 16” on day 31, and you’ll be hit with over $1,429 in fees. (If you cancel after a full year, there’s no fee, though you’ll have to pay for the rest of the month you’re on.) And cancelling, whether early or after the year, still leaves you with no laptop. Failing to return the hardware after cancelling results in a non-return fee of around the model’s full MSRP, no matter how much you’ve already paid. And you still don’t own it. According to the terms and conditions, HP can remotely lock the laptop and pass any delinquent payments over to a collection agency — ruining your credit score.

Stiff consequences for nonpayment aren’t novel, but these subscriptions are still crummy deals if you do everything right. The Linus Tech Tips video discussed the value of a year’s subscription to the Elitebook 6 G1q they rented, which is about a third of its $3,206 manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP). LTT’s video is only a tiny bit critical of the subscription’s value, but by focusing on just the first year’s costs, and quoting MSRP rather than retail price, they give HP more leeway than deserved.

HP laptops rarely sell for MSRP, either at HP.com or at sites like Best Buy. I just reviewed an HP laptop with an MSRP of nearly $4,700 that I’ve yet to see sell for more than $3,500. At publishing time HP is selling that exact Elitebook config for $1,763.30. So if you rent it at $84.99 per month, after 21 months you’ll have spent more than if you bought it outright.

I checked retail prices on all the laptops HP offers for subscription (or the closest config still available), and each one costs more to rent for two years than it does to buy. A couple of them are more expensive to rent for 14 months. You’d be able to upgrade any of them before that, after just 12 months, but that locks you in for another year, and the price may change. HP’s terms say: “If You elect to receive a Laptop Upgrade, Your Fee in subsequent months may change.”

Like a lot of loan and rental agreements or buy-now-pay-laters, these programs appeal to lower-income folks but are poised to prey on them. I’ll concede that the low barrier to entry on a laptop subscription can be tempting to someone who doesn’t have the money to pay for a laptop up front. But if buying a new laptop is not feasible, you’re better served shopping for a used or refurbished model from a few years back. You’d actually own whatever laptop you get.

HP wants to tempt you with an “affordable” way to stay at the cutting edge. But you’ll end up paying more in the long run, and you’re at the mercy of HP’s terms, its hardware availability, and whatever bits of the program may change over time. Plus, there’s no benefit to getting a new laptop every year. By the time your old laptop feels slow or a new generation of GPUs arrives, you’ll have spent way more than the price of a new one.

The Verge reached out to HP with questions about its laptop subscription program, but company reps did not respond before time of publication.

The CGO Compact is another interesting electric bike from a relatively new European challenger.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Tenways just launched its new CGO Compact electric bike in Europe that’s designed to fit into tight spaces like car trunks, apartment hallways, and train compartments.

To achieve this, the CGO Compact is fitted with small 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar fitted with a twistable stem to create a slim, wall-hugging profile. The adjustable steering column and low-step through frame also make it suitable for a wide range of rider heights, so it could be a good shareable e-bike for families. And its MIK HD rear carrier system is good for hauling up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) around town, with mounting points for additional accessories like a crate or child seat.

Tenways might not be a household name globally, but the Chinese e-bike company headquartered in the Netherlands is making a name for itself in Europe thanks to aggressive pricing, sleek designs, and over 1,500 shops and service centers. And while the CGO Compact’s €1,999 (about $2,365) price tag isn’t cheap, it’s well below the €2,681 average for European e-bikes.

The company does sell e-bikes in the US, but the CGO Compact is only for sale in Europe as of today. It features a 250W rear-hub motor connected to a Gates Carbon belt drive for maintenance-free propulsion. It promises a range of up to 100km from its 500Wh removable battery, but its single-speed drivetrain produces only 45Nm of torque so it’s best suited for relatively flat cities. If your commute does stray from asphalt then the suspension seat post should help absorb bumps. There’s also an integrated torque sensor to ensure the smooth delivery of pedal-assisted power, and Tektro hydraulic disc brakes should keep any sudden stops under control.

The CGO Compact lives up to its name regarding size, but it’s not all that lightweight. Stripped down it weighs 19.8kg (almost 44 pounds), or 22.1kg (almost 49 pounds) with all the accessories you’ll want in wet urban environments. That makes it heavier than many full-sized e-bikes, even from Tenways, and less versatile than the excellent 20-inch Brompton G foldable which also weighs less but costs more than twice as much.

Sony is remaking the original God of War trilogy, too.

To close out its February 2026 State of Play presentation, Sony revealed God of War Sons of Sparta, a new prequel 2D side scroller in the God of War franchise, and announced that it’s out right now on PlayStation 5.

”God of War Sons of Sparta is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his harsh training at the Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” Sony says. Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”

Sony’s Santa Monica Studio collaborated on the game with Mega Cat Studios. It costs $29.99, with a Digital Deluxe version available for $39.99.

Sony also announced that it’s working on a remake of the original God of War trilogy, with TC Carson set to return as the voice of Kratos. However, the project is “still very early in development, so we ask for your patience as it will be a while before anything else can be shared,” according to Sony. “When we can come back with an update, we aim to make it a big one!”

            <div id="article-text">Following mounting pressure and a questionable Super Bowl ad, the Amazon-owned company walked back its plan to integrate with the controversial law-enforcement technology company.

Following mounting pressure and a questionable Super Bowl ad, the Amazon-owned company walked back its plan to integrate with the controversial law-enforcement technology company.

Following intense backlash to its partnership with Flock Safety, a surveillance technology company that works with law enforcement agencies, Ring has announced it is canceling the integration.

In a statement published on Ring’s blog and provided to The Verge ahead of publication, the company said: “Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners … The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”

The statement goes on to say that Ring’s mission to make neighborhoods safer “comes with significant responsibility — to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the trust you place in our products and features.”

Trust is the big one there. Over the last few weeks, the company has faced significant public anger over its connection to Flock, with Ring users being encouraged to smash their cameras, and some announcing on social media that they are throwing away their Ring devices.

The Flock partnership was announced last October, but following recent unrest across the country related to ICE activities, public pressure against the Amazon-owned Ring’s involvement with the company started to mount.

Flock has reportedly allowed ICE and other federal agencies to access its network of surveillance cameras, and influencers across social media have been claiming that Ring is providing a direct link to ICE.

While that claim is not accurate, as the Flock integration has never gone live, Ring has a history of partnering with police, and the new partnership quickly came under intense criticism.

Adding fuel to the fire, this weekend Ring aired a Super Bowl ad for its new AI-powered Search Party feature. While the company says the feature is designed to find lost dogs and maintains it’s not capable of finding people, the ad raised fears that Ring cameras were being used for mass surveillance. The ad shows dozens of Ring cameras in a neighborhood scanning the streets.

On top of this, the company recently launched a new facial recognition feature, Familiar Faces. Combined with Search Party, the technological leap to using neighborhood cameras to search for people through a mass-surveillance network suddenly seems very small.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) – a longtime critic of Ring – sent an open letter this week calling on Amazon to cancel the company’s facial recognition feature.

Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger said in an email that its products are purpose-driven tech, “not tools for mass surveillance.” She added that “Familiar Faces is an opt-in feature designed to give customers more control over the alerts they receive (e.g., ‘Mom at front door’ instead of ‘Someone at front door’) while keeping their data protected.”

Ring’s partnership with Flock was announced in October 2025 as part of Ring’s Community Requests program, which launched last September. It was designed to allow local law enforcement agencies that use Flock’s software to integrate directly with the program.

Community Requests launched after Ring ended its controversial Requests for Assistance (RFA) program, which consumer advocacy groups criticized for allowing video to be provided to police without a warrant, calling it a threat to civil liberties.

In its statement about the Flock cancellation, Ring maintains that Community Requests will continue, claiming it helped authorities locate a suspect during the recent Brown University shooting:

“When a shooting occurred near Brown University in December 2025, every second mattered. The Providence Police Department turned to their community for help, putting out a Community Request. Within hours, 7 neighbors responded, sharing 168 videos that captured critical moments from the incident. One video identified a new key witness, helping lead police to identify the suspect’s vehicle and solve the case. With a shooter at large, the community faced uncertainty about their safety. Neighbors who chose to share footage played a crucial role in neutralizing the threat and restoring safety to their community.”

As with RFA, Community Requests still allows public safety agencies to request video footage from users in a certain area during an active investigation, but it differs from the previous program because law enforcement agencies are required to partner with a third-party evidence management system – such as Flock – to use the service. Ring says this is to better maintain the chain of custody. The previous system allowed police to request footage directly from a user.

Flock was the second partner Ring announced for Community Requests, the first being Axon, a law enforcement technology company known for making Tasers. With the new service, only law enforcement agencies that use these companies’ software can submit requests. But the end result is the same: law enforcement gets video from users if they choose to share it.

Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger says the Axon partnership is unaffected by the end of the Flock integration. Additionally, she says no other integrations are currently being explored.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Strap in, because the next PlayStation event is going to be a long one. Sony’s latest State of Play — a showcase event for upcoming PS5 games — kicks off on February 12th at 5PM ET and it’ll last more than an hour.

We don’t know what exactly will be shown. Sony says that the event will include “news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe.” However, it sounds like one of the biggest upcoming PS5 games, Insomniac’s bloody take on Wolverine, might not make an appearance. Most likely the event will feature a mixture of some of Sony’s tentpole single-player experiences from studios like Naughty Dog, along with its continued (albeit scaled back) push into live-service games through upcoming titles like Horizon Hunters Gathering and Bungie’s return to Marathon.

You can watch the event live on both Twitch and YouTube, and stay tuned here for all of the most important and interesting reveals and announcements.

In addition to another remaster, the Legacy of Kain series is getting a new 2D action game called Ascendance. This is the first installment since 2003’s Defiance.

The trailer was published alongside other State of Play announcements but seemingly left out of livestream. It’s launching March 31st.

To close out its February 2026 State of Play presentation, Sony revealed God of War Sons of Sparta, a new prequel 2D side scroller in the God of War franchise, and announced that it’s out right now on PlayStation 5.

”God of War Sons of Sparta is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his harsh training at the Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” Sony says. Over the course of the game, Kratos will “learn deadly skills using his spear and shield, as well as harness powerful divine artifacts known as the Gifts of Olympus to take on a wide array of foes.”

Big Walk by developer House House has another trailer showing off its immaculate “friendslop” vibes. The game is due out “later this year” on both PlayStation 5 and PC, with full crossplay support between them. On PS5, it will be included in the PlayStation Plus Essential tier.

It’s now in development, but still in the “early stages.”

The latest trailer for the 2D fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls reveals a squad featuring X-Men like Wolverine and Storm. The game looks ridiculous in the best possible way, and is launching on August 6th on both the PS5 and PC.

In a new trailer, Housemarque showed off things like the game’s main hub, the skill tree, a way to fast-travel to different locations, and how eclipses will change the game’s world. Saros launches on April 30th.

Bungie’s return to the Marathon universe launches very soon — March 5th! — so here’s a new trailer that sort of gets across what the extraction shooter will be like. You can try it out early with a “server slam” event from February 26th to March 2nd.

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth. That could describe either the plot or the making of Ocean’s Eleven.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. The main barrier to entry is usually a literal barrier to entry, like a door. Thieves’ most common move is to collude with, trick, or threaten an insider. Last year a heist cost the Louvre €88 million worth of antique jewelry, and the most sophisticated technology in play was an angle grinder.

The low-tech Louvre maneuvers were in keeping with what heist research long ago concluded. In 2014 US nuclear weapons researchers at Sandia National Laboratories took a detour into this demimonde, producing a 100-page report called “The Perfect Heist: Recipes from Around the World.” The scientists were worried someone might try to steal a nuke from the US arsenal, and so they compiled information on 23 high-value robberies from 1972 to 2012 into a “Heist Methods and Characteristics Database,” a critical mass of knowledge on what worked. Thieves, they found, dedicated huge amounts of money and time to planning and practice runs—sometimes more than 100. They’d use brute force, tunneling through sewers for months (Société Générale bank heist, Nice, France, 1976), or guile, donning police costumes to fool guards (Gardner Museum, Boston, 1990). But nobody was using, say, electromagnetic pulse generators to shut down the Las Vegas electrical grid. The most successful robbers got to the valuable stuff unseen and got out fast.

Advance the time frame, and the situation looks much the same. Last year, Spanish researchers looking at art crimes from 1990 to 2022 found that the least technical methods are still the most successful. “High-tech technology doesn’t work so well,” says Erin L. Thompson, an art historian at John Jay College of Justice who studies art crime. Speed and practice trump complicated systems and alarms; even that Louvre robbery was, at heart, just a minutes-long smash-and-grab.

An emphasis on speed doesn’t mean heists don’t require skill—panache, even. As the old saying goes, amateurs talk strategy; professionals study logistics. Even without gadgets, heists and heist movies still revel in an engineer’s mindset. “Heist movies absolutely celebrate deep-dive nerdery—‘I’m going to know everything I can about the power grid, about this kind of stone and drill, about Chicago at night,’” says Anna Kornbluh, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She published a paper last October on the ways heist movies reflect an Old Hollywood approach to collective art-making, while shows about new grift, like those detailing the rise and fall of WeWork or the con artist Anna Delvey, reflect the more lone-wolf, disrupt-and-grow mindset of the streaming era.

Her work might help explain why law-abiding citizens might cheer for the kinds of guys who’d steal a crown from the Louvre, or $100,000 worth of escargot from a farm in Champagne (as happened just a few weeks later). Heists, says Kornbluh, are anti-oligarch praxis. “Everybody wants to know how to be in a competent collective. Everybody wants there to be better logistics,” she says. “We need a better state. We need a better society. We need a better world.” Those are shared values—and as another old saying tells us, where there is value, there is crime.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.

He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. At the same time, he defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health.

In MIT Technology Review’s profile of O’Neill last year, people working in health policy and consumer advocacy said they found his libertarian views on drug regulation “worrisome” and “antithetical to basic public health.”

He was later named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting him in charge of the nation’s public health agency.

But fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope O’Neill will bring attention and funding to their cause: the search for treatments that might slow, prevent, or even reverse human aging. Here are some takeaways from the interview.

Last month, the US cut the number of vaccines recommended for children. The CDC no longer recommends vaccinations against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, or meningococcal disease for all children. The move was widely panned by medical groups and public health experts. Many worry it will become more difficult for children to access those vaccines. The majority of states have rejected the recommendations.

In the confirmation hearing for his role as deputy secretary of health and human services, which took place in May last year, O’Neill said he supported the CDC’s vaccine schedule. MIT Technology Review asked him if that was the case and, if so, what made him change his mind. “Researching and examining and reviewing safety data and efficacy data about vaccines is one of CDC’s obligations,” he said. “CDC gives important advice about vaccines and should always be open to new data and new ways of looking at data.”

At the beginning of December, O’Neill said, President Donald Trump “asked me to look at what other countries were doing in terms of their vaccine schedules.” He said he spoke to health ministries of other countries and consulted with scientists at the CDC and FDA. “It was suggested to me by lots of the operating divisions that the US focus its recommendations on consensus vaccines of other developed nations—in other words, the most important vaccines that are most often part of the core recommendations of other countries,” he said.

“As a result of that, we did an update to the vaccine schedule to focus on a set of vaccines that are most important for all children.”

But some experts in public health have said that countries like Denmark and Japan, whose vaccine schedules the new US one was supposedly modeled on, are not really comparable to the US. When asked about these criticisms, O’Neill replied, “A lot of parents feel that … more than 70 vaccine doses given to young children sounds like a really high number, and some of them ask which ones are the most important. I think we helped answer that question in a way that didn’t remove anyone’s access.”

A few weeks after the vaccine recommendations were changed, Kirk Milhoan, who leads the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said that vaccinations for measles and polio—which are currently required for entry to public schools—should be optional. (Mehmet Oz, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services director, has more recently urged people to “take the [measles] vaccine.”)

“CDC still recommends that all children are vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), for which there is international consensus, as well as varicella (chickenpox),” he said when asked for his thoughts on this comment.

He also said that current vaccine guidelines are “still subject to new data coming in, new ways of thinking about things.” “CDC, FDA, and NIH are initiating new studies of the safety of immunizations,” he added. “We will continue to ask the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review evidence and make updated recommendations with rigorous science and transparency.”

O’Neill said he wants longevity to become a priority for US health agencies. His ultimate goal, he said, is to “make the damage of aging something that’s under medical control.” It’s “the same way of thinking” as the broader Make America Healthy Again approach, he said: “‘Again’ implies restoration of health, which is what longevity research and therapy is all about.”

O’Neill said his interest in longevity was ignited by his friend Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur, around 2008 to 2009. It was right around the time O’Neill was finishing up a previous role in HHS, under the Bush administration. O’Neill said Thiel told him he “should really start looking into longevity and the idea that aging damage could be reversible.” “I just got more and more excited about that idea,” he said.

When asked if he’s heard of Vitalism, a philosophical movement for “hardcore” longevity enthusiasts who, broadly, believe that death is wrong, O’Neill replied: “Yes.”

The Vitalist declaration lists five core statements, including “Death is humanity’s core problem,” “Obviating aging is scientifically plausible,” and “I will carry the message against aging and death.” O’Neill said he agrees with all of them. “I suppose I am [a Vitalist],” he said with a smile, although he’s not a paying member of the foundation behind it.

As deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill assumes a level of responsibility for huge and influential science and health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research) and the Food and Drug Administration (which oversees drug regulation and is globally influential) as well as the CDC.

Today, he said, he sees support for longevity science from his colleagues within HHS. “If I could describe one common theme to the senior leadership at HHS, obviously it’s to make America healthy again, and reversing aging damage is all about making people healthy again,” he said. “We are refocusing HHS on addressing and reversing chronic disease, and chronic diseases are what drive aging, broadly.”

Over the last year, thousands of NIH grants worth over $2 billion were frozen or terminated, including funds for research on cancer biology, health disparities, neuroscience, and much more. When asked whether any of that funding will be restored, he did not directly address the question, instead noting: “You’ll see a lot of funding more focused on important priorities that actually improve people’s health.”

He promised we’ll hear more from ARPA-H, the three-year-old federal agency dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in medical science and biotechnology. It was established with the official goal of promoting “high-risk, high-reward innovation for the development and translation of transformative health technologies.”

O’Neill said that “ARPA-H exists to make the impossible possible in health and medicine.” The agency has a new director—Alicia Jackson, who formerly founded and led a company focused on women’s health and longevity, took on the role in October last year.

O’Neill said he helped recruit Jackson, and that she was hired in part because of her interest in longevity, which will now become a major focus of the agency. He said he meets with her regularly, as well as with Andrew Brack and Jean Hébert, two other longevity supporters who lead departments at ARPA-H. Brack’s program focuses on finding biological markers of aging. Hebert’s aim is to find a way to replace aging brain tissue, bit by bit.

O’Neill is especially excited by that one, he said. “I would try it … Not today, but … if progress goes in a broadly good direction, I would be open to it. We’re hoping to see significant results in the next few years.”

He’s also enthused by the idea of creating all-new organs for transplantation. “Someday we want to be able to grow new organs, ideally from the patients’ own cells,” O’Neill said. An ARPA-H program will receive $170 million over five years to that end, he adds. “I’m very excited about the potential of ARPA-H and Alicia and Jean and Andrew to really push things forward.”

O’Neill said he also regularly talks to the team at the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives. The organization, led by Dylan Livingston, played an instrumental role in changing state law in Montana to make experimental therapies more accessible. O’Neill said he hasn’t formally worked with them but thinks that “they’re doing really good work on raising awareness, including on Capitol Hill.”

Livingston has told me that A4LI’s main goals center around increasing support for aging research (possibly via the creation of a new NIH institute entirely dedicated to the subject) and changing laws to make it easier and cheaper to develop and access potential anti-aging therapies.

O’Neill gave the impression that the first goal might be a little overambitious—the number of institutes is down to Congress, he said. “I would like to get really all of the institutes at NIH to think more carefully about how many chronic diseases are usefully thought of as pathologies of aging damage,” he said. There’ll be more federal funding for that research, he said, although he won’t say more for now.

Some members of the longevity community have more radical ideas when it comes to regulation: they want to create their own jurisdictions designed to fast-track the development of longevity drugs and potentially encourage biohacking and self-experimentation.

It&#39;s a concept that O’Neill has expressed support for in the past. He has posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, and in support of building “freedom cities”—a similar concept that involves creating new cities on federal land.

Another longevity enthusiast who supports the concept is Niklas Anzinger, a German tech entrepreneur who is now based in Próspera, a private city within a Honduran “special economic zone,” where residents can make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Anzinger also helped draft Montana’s state law on accessing experimental therapies. O’Neill knows Anzinger and said he talks to him “once or twice a year.”

O’Neill has also supported the idea of seasteading—building new “startup countries” at sea. He served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute until March 2024.

In 2009, O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference that “the healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea.” When asked if he still thinks that’s the case, he said: “It’s not quite 2030, so I think it’s too soon to say … What I would say now is: the healthiest societies are likely to be the ones that encourage innovation the most.”

When it comes to his own personal ambitions for longevity, O’Neill said, he takes a simple approach that involves minimizing sugar and ultraprocessed food, exercising and sleeping well, and supplementing with vitamin D. He also said he tries to “eat a diet that has plenty of protein and saturated fat,” echoing the new dietary guidance issued by the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That guidance has been criticized by nutrition scientists, who point out that it ignores decades of research into the harms of a diet high in saturated fat.

We can expect to see more nutrition-related updates from HHS, said O’Neill: “We’re doing more research, more randomized controlled trials on nutrition. Nutrition is still not a scientifically solved problem.” Saturated fats are of particular interest, he said. He and his colleagues want to identify “the healthiest fats,” he said.

In a bid to treat blindness, Life Biosciences will try out potent cellular reprogramming technology on volunteers.

They argue we need a revolution—and more and more influential scientists, funders, and politicians are taking them seriously.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).

Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” “The best thing you could do is eliminate out everything except fatty meat and lard,” Anthony Chaffee, an MD with almost 400,000 followers, said in an Instagram post.

And I almost choked on my broccoli when, while scrolling LinkedIn, I came across an interview with another doctor declaring that “there is zero scientific evidence to say that vegetables are required in the human diet.” That doctor, who described himself as “90% carnivore,” went on to say that all he’d eaten the previous day was a kilo of beef, and that vegetables have “anti-nutrients,” whatever they might be.

You don’t have to spend much time on social media to come across claims like this. The “traditionalist” influencer, author, and psychologist Jordan Peterson was promoting a meat-only diet as far back as 2018. A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that the most diet information is shared on Instagram and YouTube, and that a lot of it is nonsense. So much so that the authors describe it as a “growing public health concern.”

What’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. In January Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, told a USA Today reporter that he was on a carnivore diet. “I only eat meat or fermented foods,” he said. He went on to say that the diet had helped him lose “40% of [his] visceral fat within a month.”

“Government needs to stop spreading misinformation that natural and saturated fats are bad for you,” Food and Drug Administration commissioner Martin Makary argued in a recent podcast interview. The principles of “whole foods and clean meats” are “biblical,” he said. The interviewer said that Makary’s warnings about pesticides made him want to “avoid all salads and completely miss the organic section in the grocery store.”

For the record: There’s plenty of evidence that a diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease. That’s not government misinformation.

The carnivore doctors’ suggestion to avoid vegetables is wrong too, says Gabby Headrick, associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security. There’s no evidence to suggest that a meat-only diet is good for you. “All of the nutrition science to date strongly identifies a wide array of vegetables … as being very health-promoting,” she adds.

To be fair to the influencers out there, diet is a tricky thing to study. Much of the research into nutrition relies on volunteers to keep detailed and honest food diaries—something that people are generally quite bad at. And the way our bodies respond to foods might be influenced by our genetics, our microbiomes, the way we prepare or consume those foods, and who knows what else.

Still, it will come as a surprise to no one that there is plenty of what the above study calls “low-quality content” floating around on social media. So it’s worth arming ourselves with a good dose of skepticism, especially when we come across posts that mention “miracle foods” or extreme, limited diets.

The truth is that most food is neither good nor bad when eaten in moderation. Diet trends come and go, and for most people, the best reasonable advice is simply to eat a balanced diet low in sugar, salt, and saturated fat. You know—the basics. No matter what that weird upside-down food pyramid implies. To the carnivore influencers, I say: get your misinformation off my broccoli.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money.

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you opened a tech newsletter or even the internet in early 2026 and thought you’d stepped into a dystopian screenplay, or you are the main character in one of Isaac Asimov’s writings, you wouldn’t be alone.

Headlines trumpet layoffs, companies blame “AI transformation,” and somewhere in the background, billionaires cheer hot-off-the-press artificial intelligence strategies. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: people are still losing their jobs, while AI gets most of the credit.

According to the most recent tracking data, the pace of layoffs in tech remains high in 2026. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January 2026, the strongest January for layoffs since 2009, and more than double the total from the same month a year earlier

Let’s put some names to these numbers because real humans were behind them.

In late January 2026, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts, part of a wider reduction that has already seen tens of thousands of roles eliminated since late 2025. Revenue was high, investment in AI infrastructure was soaring, and yet people were still shown the door.

Salesforce, a company that frequently boasts about its AI products, quietly cut fewer than 1,000 jobs across teams, including marketing and product roles. These cuts even hit a division tied to their own AI products, which had been touted internally as strategic.

Layoff reports also include giants like Meta and Block, financial institutions, and even non-tech conglomerates retrenching under cost pressures.

Almost every layoff announcement seems to arrive with the same footnote: “This reflects our focus on AI and automation.” It’s catchy and convenient, and it shifts the conversation from “people lost their livelihoods” to “we are evolving.”

But there’s growing skepticism. Journalists and analysts have begun to use the term “AI-washing” to describe how companies attribute layoffs to artificial intelligence without clear evidence that AI systems replaced workers. They note that many organisations had no mature, scalable AI implementations capable of genuinely absorbing the tasks of entire teams before the cuts were announced.

This matters because real evidence of AI displacing large numbers of workers in the sense of robots doing jobs humans used to do is still limited. A recent firm-level study suggests that the use of AI tools can substitute some contracted labour over time, but the magnitude of this substitution remains modest and gradual rather than explosive.

So when a corporate press release asserts “AI is transforming our workforce,” match that upbeat line with the more prosaic reality: financial pressures, slower markets, and the legacy of pandemic hiring adjustments still account for a large share of job losses. Analysts have pointed out that many layoffs associated with AI could be driven as much by economic necessity or managerial optics as by genuine automation.

Tech layoffs aren’t an American story alone. In Europe, companies from telecommunications to manufacturing have either frozen hiring or cut jobs in response to slowing markets and external pressures.

The semiconductor maker ASML announced cuts of about 1,700 positions, while Ericsson is trimming around 1,600 roles in Sweden to adapt to a prolonged downturn in 5G spending. The consumer goods sector, banks, and industrial firms also announced job reductions in late 2025 and early 2026, reflecting a broader economic slowdown that goes far beyond a single technology trend.

In many of these cases, AI barely enters the conversation, but the human impact certainly does.

Putting it bluntly, 2026 isn’t yet the year robots suddenly outperformed entire industries and made humanity redundant. Historical layoffs like IBM’s roughly 60,000 job cuts in the 1990s or massive reductions during economic downturns like 2008  still rank among the largest single events in corporate labour history.

But what is different now is the narrative that accompanies it. Unlike blunt economic downturns, today’s layoffs are often framed as strategic transformations, a necessary step to embrace the shiny promise of artificial intelligence.

That frame protects executives and investors, but offers little consolation to the people whose positions are eliminated in the name of “efficiency.”

Let’s call it what it is. People are losing valuable jobs, and many of the reasons offered for those losses are wrapped in tech buzzwords. AI has the potential to change how work is done; no reasonable person denies that, but conflating investment in algorithms with wholesale human job replacement is an oversimplification that does a disservice to anyone trying to make sense of this moment.

If 2026 teaches us anything, it’s this: layoffs are real, painful, and often rooted in economic and strategic decisions that have little to do with machines spontaneously deciding they need fewer humans.

And the rush to blame AI as a convenient scapegoat obscures the deeper, harder questions we should be asking about how we value people, work, and community in a world that is increasingly enamoured with the idea of automation.

So yes, layoffs are sweeping across companies large and small. No, there isn’t clear evidence that AI has replaced humans en masse. And if we continue to let that narrative dominate, we risk forgetting that behind every data point is a human life, someone whose value isn’t measured in lines of code or the future earning potential of a machine.

Where we go from here depends on whether we treat people as assets to optimize away or as the very reason innovation should serve society in the first place.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <h2>Understanding the valuation of intangible assets in tech deals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.

            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.
