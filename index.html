            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/a-weird-itchy-rash-is-linked-to-the-keto-diet-but-no-one-knows-why/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 20-year old man in Taiwan went to a dermatology clinic for a strange rash that had developed across his shoulders and chest. The raised, red, and itchy condition had been bothering him for a full month. By this point, he had also developed patches of pigmented skin interlaced with the red rash.

According to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine, a skin biopsy showed swelling between his skin cells and inflammation around blood vessels, but testing came up negative for other common signs of skin conditions, leaving doctors with few leads. The doctors ultimately came to a diagnosis not by analyzing his skin further but by hearing about his diet.

The man told doctors that two months prior to his clinic appointment—a month before his rash developed—he had switched to a ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat but very low-carbohydrate eating pattern. This diet forces the body to shift from using glucose (sugar derived from carbohydrates) as an energy source to fat instead.

When this happens, the body can go into ketosis. This starts with fat tissue breaking down, leading to the release of free fatty acids. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they’re metabolized to acetyl-CoA. Excessive amounts of this molecule gum up metabolic processes and lead to the formation of ketone bodies, primarily acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. (A ketone is a specific chemical structure that includes a single bond to two CH3 or R groups with a double bond to an oxygen molecule.) Ketone bodies made in the liver can enter the circulatory system and be used as a source of energy for tissues around the body, particularly the brain.

Ketogenic diets have clinical uses—they’ve proven useful for managing drug-resistant epilepsy and some rare genetic metabolic diseases. Studies have looked at them as possible ways to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes, and there’s interest in their use in cancer metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims are lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.

There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of common side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.

But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or prurigo pigmentosa. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.

The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.

In a review this month, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.

While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.

In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.</div>

            <h2>TR-49 is interactive fiction for fans of deep research rabbit holes</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.

TR-49 takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.

The entirety of TR-49 takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.

Your only real form of interaction with the world of TR-49 is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character split-flap on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.

While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like Her Story, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.

You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.

As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.

Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.

I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think TR-49‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.

One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like Blue Prince or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.

TR-49 also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.

There are bound to be some people who see TR-49 as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, TR-49 is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/core-ultra-series-3-launch-may-be-hampered-by-chip-shortages-says-intel/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 yesterday, and the news both for the quarter and for the year was mixed: year-over-year revenue was down nearly imperceptibly, from $53.1 billion to $52.9 billion, while revenue for the quarter was down about four percent, from $14.3 billion last year to $13.7 billion this year. (That number was, nevertheless, on the high end of Intel’s guidance for the quarter, which ranged from $12.8 to $13.8 billion.)

Diving deeper into the numbers makes it clear exactly where money is being made and lost: Intel’s data center and AI products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year, while its client computing group (which sells Core processors, Arc GPUs, and other consumer products) was down 7 percent for the quarter and 3 percent for the year.

That knowledge makes it slightly easier to understand the bind that company executives talked about on Intel’s earnings call (as transcribed by Investing.com). In short, Intel is having trouble making (and buying) enough chips to meet demand, and it makes more sense to allocate the chips it can make to the divisions that are actually making money—which means that we could see shortages of or higher prices for consumer processors, just as Intel is gearing up to launch the promising Core Ultra Series 3 processors (codenamed Panther Lake).

Intel CFO David Zinsner indicated that Intel is “prioritizing [its] internal wafer supply to data center” and having more of its consumer chips made externally. Substantial portions of the Core Ultra Series 3 processors are manufactured at Intel, after the company primarily used TSMC’s chip factories for the Core Ultra Series 2 designs.

“We can’t completely vacate the client market,” said Zinsner, but Intel is “shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand.”

Compounding this is that yields for the new 18A process—that is, the number of chips in a wafer with no defects that can work as designed—are still improving. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that “while yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.”

Yields are currently improving by 7 or 8 percent every month, according to Intel. But that could be building on pretty low initial yields—reporting from last summer suggested that just 10 percent of the chips coming off of the 18A production lines were meeting Intel’s requirements at the time. Intel predicts that its supply will have ramped up enough within the next few months to help alleviate shortages.

“I do believe that the first quarter is the trough,” said Zinsner. “We will improve supply in the second quarter.”

When Intel can start making enough chips to meet its demand, it ought to help brighten the company’s earnings reports.

“We delivered [our Q4 2025] results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets,” said Tan. “We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers’ needs going forward.”

Intel has been signaling for a while now that it was selling essentially all of the chips it could get its hands on. Intel investor relations VP John Pitzer said last month that Intel would be selling more of both its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake Core Ultra Series 2 chips for consumers, as well as its Granite Rapids chips for data centers, if it could get more of them.

As Intel seeks to improve its position in the short term, the company also says that it’s still making progress on its future manufacturing nodes, including different versions of the 18A process and the upcoming 14A process. Intel is working to engage “potential external customers” who would use the 14A process to make their own chips. If these third parties decide to use Intel’s manufacturing facilities, Intel expects to know about it “starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027,” and then it expects to build out manufacturing capacity based on the number of external customers it finds.

On the chip design side, Intel also expects to have its first next-generation Nova Lake chips ready “at the end of 2026.” We don’t know much about Nova Lake yet, but it should be Intel’s next architecture to cover both desktop and laptop processors, while Panther Lake chips are intended mainly for laptops. At least part of the chip will also be manufactured using the 18A process.</div>

            <h2>DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask anonymous ICE critics online</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.

DHS initially fought Doe’s motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things.” This was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties,” DHS alleged. DHS’s arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though Wired noted that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.

To Doe, the agency seemed intent on testing the waters to see if it could seize authority to unmask all critics online by invoking a customs statute that allows agents to subpoena information on goods entering or leaving the US.

But then, on January 16, DHS abruptly reversed course, withdrawing its summonses from Meta.

A court filing confirmed that DHS dropped its requests for subscriber information last week, after initially demanding Doe’s “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses.”

The filing does not explain why DHS decided to withdraw its requests.

However, previously, DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests, too, after account holders defended their First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash their summonses, Doe’s court filing said.

To defeat DHS’ summonses, Doe shared all his group’s online posts with the court. An attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Ariel Shapell, told Ars that Doe’s groups posted “pretty innocuous” content, like “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils.”

It’s possible DHS caved due to lack of evidence supporting claims that Doe’s groups’ posts carried implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS had argued. But it’s also possible that DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask ICE critics due to strong First Amendment protections working to preserve the right to post anonymously online.

The attempt to unmask Doe’s accounts came as criticism of ICE is mounting nationwide, and a win could have given ICE broad authority to attack that growing base of critics if DHS had dug in and its defense actually held.

DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses could signal that the argument the agency tried to raise—weirdly using a statute tied to the “importation/exportation of merchandise” to seize “unlimited subpoena authority” of ICE critics online—is clearly not a winning one.

Meta did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. But Meta did play a role in challenging DHS’ summonses, initially by seeking more information from the agency and then notifying account holders to provide an opportunity to quash the summonses before information was shared.

So far, the playbook for community watch groups on Facebook and Instagram has been to follow Meta’s advice in order to block identifying information from being shared. But it remains unclear if Meta may have complied with DHS’s requests if account holders were not able to legally fight to quash them, perhaps leaving a vulnerable gray area for community watch groups.

For Doe and any others involved in “MontCo Community Watch,” DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses likely comes as a relief. But this wasn’t the first time DHS tried and failed to unmask online critics, so it’s just as likely that fears remain that DHS will continue trying to identify groups that are posting footage to raise awareness of ICE’s most controversial moves.

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

Tensions remain high as US citizens defend both their neighbors and their own constitutional rights. Most recently, shocking footage of ICE using a 5-year-old boy as bait to trap other family members intensified calls to defund ICE. Public backlash also raged after videos showed ICE removing a US citizen from his home in his underwear. That arrest happened while ICE was conducting a warrantless search that a whistleblower warned is becoming the new ICE norm after an internal memo said that agents can enter homes without a judicial warrant.

Some politicians are starting to take up the call to diminish ICE’s power. On Thursday, the majority of House Democrats voted to defund ICE, which Politico noted was a “remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago.” Of course, the ICE budget bill passed anyway, since Republicans control the House, but with public approval of ICE tanking, any ongoing pushback could hurt Republicans in midterms and eventually even doom ICE if momentum is sustained.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump White House yesterday posted a manipulated photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney who was arrested after protesting in a church where a pastor is allegedly also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted what seems to be the original photo of Armstrong being led away by an officer yesterday morning. A half hour later, the official White House X account posted an altered version in which Armstrong’s face was manipulated to make it appear that she was crying.

“The White House shared an AI-edited photo of Nekima, depicting her in tears and scared when, in actuality, she was poised, determined, and unafraid,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said yesterday.

Reader-added context on X said, “This photo has been digitally altered to make Nekima Levy Armstrong appear to be in distress. The Director of DHS herself posted the unedited photo in an earlier announcement.” White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr defended the post after criticism of the image manipulation.

“Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Dorr wrote. The White House post with the manipulated image called Levy Armstrong a “far-left agitator” who “orchestrated[ed] church riots in Minnesota.”

A DHS press release about the arrest used the same image posted by Noem, without the alteration.

Jordan Kushner, an attorney for Levy Armstrong, said, “It is just so outrageous that the White House would make up stories about someone to try and discredit them. She was completely calm and composed and rational. There was no one crying. So this is just outrageous defamation.”

Speaking to The Associated Press, Kushner also said that the “video Levy Armstrong’s husband shot ‘dismantles what they claim’ and that the video would be released soon.”

Protesters disrupted services on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press quoted Levy Armstrong as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”

The church website lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The lawsuit lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”

Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which prohibits “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”

“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.

St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued statements supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”

A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Kushner called the arrests a “farce” and alleged that Bondi and Noem ordered the arrests only so they could celebrate them on social media, according to the Pioneer Press. “This doesn’t happen in a legitimate prosecution,” Kushner said. “These are officials making a political decision, and purposely making a political spectacle and a political circus out of the court system for their own purposes.”

Kushner also “said federal agents detained one of Armstrong’s friends two days [previously], using force to tackle her in a hotel lobby, under the mistaken impression she was Armstrong,” the Pioneer Press wrote.

Marques Armstrong, Levy Armstrong’s husband, said she offered to turn herself in after the mistaken detention of her friend.

“Initially they agreed and then a call came from up high and said, ‘No, we have to take her there (at the hotel).’ They wanted her in handcuffs,” he was quoted as saying. An “agent took photos and said it won’t go on social media. I knew it was a lie,” he also said.

The White House’s posting of a manipulated version of the arrest photo could be used in Levy Armstrong’s legal defense. As the New York Times wrote, her lawyer could argue that the post was an improper extrajudicial statement that may prejudice potential jurors and that it shows the Justice Department filed charges vindictively. We contacted Kushner about the manipulated photo and case today and will update this article if he provides any comment.

The NAACP called for the release of Levy Armstrong, Allen, and a third arrestee, William Kelly. “Their arrests violated their constitutional rights and NAACP demands their immediate release,” the NAACP said. “Ms. Armstrong and her fellow demonstrators gathered peacefully at a church over the pastor’s alleged leadership within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protests follow the increase in ICE activity and the fatal shooting of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good.”

The Justice Department also tried to bring charges against journalist Don Lemon, but a judge rejected the charges. Lemon was at the demonstration but said he was there as a journalist and not a protester.</div>

            <h2>Telly’s "free" ad-based TVs make notable revenue—when they’re actually delivered</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/tellys-free-ad-based-tvs-make-notable-revenue-when-theyre-actually-delivered/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Telly, a company that accepts advertising data instead of cash for its TVs, has reportedly had a hard time getting its “free” TVs into people’s homes.

Telly debuted in May 2023. Its dual-screen design can show ads, even when people aren’t watching. Although the smaller, secondary screen can be used for more helpful applications, like showing the weather or sports scores, its primary purpose is to serve as a billboard south of the 55-inch primary display. Owners cannot disable tracking or cover up the secondary screen (or they have to pay for the TV, which Telly claims is worth $1,000), and they must fill out a lengthy, detailed survey to get one.

When it debuted its TV, Telly said it expected to ship 500,000 devices that summer. In June 2023, the startup said 250,000 people signed up to get a Telly. In a 2024 press release, Telly said that it planned to ship “millions more in 2024.”

But a report from Lowpass this week, citing a “Q3 update sent to investors in November 2025,” said the startup had 35,000 TVs in people’s homes at that time. In Q2 2025, there were 28,000 Telly TVs in use, the note said, according to Lowpass.

The publication reported that the investor note suggests Telly will order 100,000 TVs from supplier Foxconn and increase deliveries soon.

Telly declined to comment to Lowpass and didn’t respond to Ars Technica’s requests for comment.

So what gives? Based on early registration numbers, it seems Telly has generated enough interest to ship more than 35,000 TVs.

One issue seems to be poor shipping. Per the investor note that Lowpass reviewed, Telly claimed that FedEx delivered 10 percent of its shipments of Telly TVs broken. Since moving to a different company—seemingly Samsung partner RXO, based on Reddit posts—fewer Tellys are arriving broken, the company reportedly said.

As Lowpass noted, dozens of online complaints claim that the free TVs, which ship directly from Telly, were broken upon arrival. The Verge also reported receiving a broken unit in September.

Today, the subreddit dedicated to Telly TVs seems to show numerous other technical difficulties Telly users are experiencing. Technical complaints are common on subreddits for tech gadgets, but the forum highlights the problems Telly owners might encounter.

Telly’s reported failure to meet its high shipment goals or even fulfill reported demand demonstrates the scaling complexities startups can face. While some companies struggle to get people interested in their product, Telly’s “free” pitch has been successful enough to lure thousands. But in its early stages, Telly has reportedly struggled with its direct-to-consumer model and smaller team compared to other TV makers.

Still, Telly’s ad-centric business model may be starting to show its value. The investor update reportedly said Telly made $22 million in annualized revenue in Q3 2025. This could equate to about $52 in advertising revenue per Telly in use per month ($22 million divided by 35,000 TVs divided by 12 months in a year is $52.38).

That’s notably more than what other TV companies report, as Lowpass pointed out. As a comparison to other budget TV brands that rely heavily on ads and user tracking, Roku reported an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $41.49 for 2024. Vizio, meanwhile, reported an ARPU of $37.17 in 2024.

The investor note reportedly said that Telly recently raised $350 million in debt funding over two rounds. The note didn’t specify when the funding occurred or how much equity Telly has raised overall.

As smart TVs at every price point increasingly rely on software-integrated advertisements and user tracking to offset declining hardware margins and rising competition, Telly argues that its premise is forward-thinking, not far-fetched. Some longtime Telly users point to the sets’ decent image and audio quality but question their reliance on an (included) streaming stick to access popular apps, their default AI-avatar home screen, and repetitive ads.

The Verge writer Emma Roth said her Telly showed her “three of the same ads in Spanish (which I don’t speak) in a row.” There’s also concern about potentially invasive uses of the TV’s integrated camera and mic.

As the leaked investor report highlights, there are plenty of other challenges standing in the way of free, ad-supported TVs. Still, Telly’s early ARPU figures are notable enough to keep the idea alive.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, Facebook’s feeds have been drowned out by an unrelenting tidal wave of AI slop, turning the platform — which feels like it’s long been abandoned by practically anybody under the age of 65 — into an unrecognizable digital hellscape.

It’s already been two years since we came across a picture of “shrimp Jesus” for the first time, an early form of AI-generated junk that foreshadowed an even more nonsensical future, culminating in Merriam-Webster making “slop” its 2025 word of the year last month.

Now, thanks to the advent of accessible text-to-video generators, which can cough up footage from a simple text prompt, the situation on Facebookand other Meta platforms is turning from dire to disastrous.

A quick perusal of the r/FacebookAIslop subreddit reveals the macabre underbelly of the AI slop world, once again highlighting how social media feeds have turned from posts created by our friends and family into an endless parade of mind-numbing drek.

One 50-second video making its rounds shows what appears to be a humanoid cat cooking a meal, only for its kitten-shaped daughter to dive headfirst into a meat grinder and be turned to pulp. The kitten’s parents remain unaware, only to puke up green sludge after unintentionally eating their offspring. The baffling clip ends with the mother cat being arrested by the police, leaving her feline husband sobbing on the floor.

Another clip, originally posted on Meta’s Instagram, shows a “shark doctor” spraying a Black baby white with paint, while charring a white baby with a torch in what appears to be a maternity ward. The clip is chock-full of bafflingly racist stereotypes. Yet another clip shows a goosebumps-inducingly photorealistic cat with eight spider legs crawling down the side of a wall.

The sheer amount of junk polluting Facebook and Instagram feeds is unlikely to go away any time soon. As Facebook’s vice president of product, Jagjit Chawla, told CNET last year, the company’s algorithms respond to users watching specific pieces of content.

“If you, as a user, are interested in a piece of content which happens to be AI-generated, the recommendations algorithm will determine that, over time, you are interested in this topic and content,” he said. “If you are not into it, which, for lack of a better term, there is a set of users who would consider that content AI slop, and if you have given us signals that this is not for you, that algorithm will respond appropriately to make sure we don’t show you more of that.”

Reading between the lines, users who are watching in horror as their news feeds devolve into a lifeless wave of slop are the source of their own demise.

The company’s algorithms are also responding to positive signals, like liking, commenting, or sharing — and considering the slop being shared on Facebook is getting plenty of those, it’s no wonder we’re seeing more and more of it in our feeds.

The issue goes beyond humanoid sharks and cats. One clip spotted by Agence France-Presse shows the United States’ first lady Melania Trump spending $10 million to build a church and showing up “alone to decorate it for Christmas.” Another clip shows singer Sabrina Carpenter attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony of a new church.

Some is overt theft. Hollywood screenwriter Scott Collette recently noticed that an AI Facebook account was stealing his history posts and “slopping out new captions.”

In retaliation, he started “feeding it poison pills,” causing the page’s followers to have “meltdowns” in the comments.

Other companies have since acknowledged the issue of AI slop, pledging to address the issue. For instance, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said that combating slop will be a “top priority” this year.

Whether Meta will follow suit remains to be seen. For now, it will be up to users to decide whether they’re willing to trudge through a barrage of AI sludge to see glimpses of what their friends and family have been posting — that is, if they even bothered to in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scientists have long suspected that Mars was once teeming with water, a tropical oasis with vast river systems that may have been able to support life billions of years ago.

To get a better picture of what such a lush ocean world could’ve looked like, an international team of researchers used satellite data to simulate the sea level in a colossal geographic feature called Coprates Chasma, which is part of the Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the entire solar system.

While examining the satellite imagery, the team concluded that the structures of the canyon closely resembled river deltas on Earth, supporting the theory that the Red Planet was once a “blue planet,” around three billion years ago.

As detailed in a study published in the journal NPJ Space Exploration, the team found geomorphologic structures in the vicinity of the Valles Marineris that closely resemble the mouth of a river where it flows into the ocean back on Earth.

They then inferred a sea level at the time when this river was still flowing, determining it dates back to a time in the planet’s history with the “largest availability of surface water on Mars.”

The team used data collected by the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express orbiter, as well as NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, for their investigation.

“The unique high-resolution satellite images of Mars have enabled us to study the Martian landscape in great detail by surveying and mapping,” said coauthor and University of Bern PhD student Ignatius Argadestya in a statement.

“When measuring and mapping the Martian images, I was able to recognize mountains and valleys that resemble a mountainous landscape on Earth,” he added. “However, I was particularly impressed by the deltas that I discovered at the edge of one of the mountains.”

The team compared the Martian “fan deltas,” which occur when a fan-shaped cone of sediment from a mountain stream empties into a standing body of water, to those that form back on Earth, and found that they mapped onto each other strikingly well.

“The structures that we were able to identify in the images are clearly the mouth of a river into an ocean,” coauthor and University of Bern geology professor Fritz Schlunegger explained.

From there, the team inferred that the ocean the delta flowed into was at least the size of the Arctic Ocean on Earth.

While Schlunegger admitted that he and his colleagues were “not the first to postulate the existence and size of the ocean,” their “reconstruction of the sea level” is “based on clear evidence for such a coastline,” including “high-resolution images.”

“With our study, we were able to provide evidence for the deepest and largest former ocean on Mars to date — an ocean that stretched across the northern hemisphere of the planet,” Argadestya added.

What implications the findings have for the search for ancient life on Mars remains unclear. But it’s an intriguing new glimpse into the planet’s ancient history when it was still teeming with water — a tantalizingly habitable spot far away from home.

            <div id="article-text">In case you needed further evidence that we’re living in the worst version of a cyberpunk dystopia, immigration officers are now scanning civilians’ faces to index them in a government database.

Don’t take our word for it — just listen to the officers themselves. A video shared by freelance journalist Brian Allen appears to show a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent scan a couple’s faces with his phone.

“It’s not illegal to record,” the woman filming the ICE agents says after the agent points his phone at her. “Exactly, that’s what we’re doing,” another officer says.

“Why are you taking my information down?” the woman behind the camera asks.

The officer responds: “because we have a nice little database, and now you’re considered domestic terrorists.”

“For video taping you? Are you crazy?” the woman shoots back before the clip ends.

🚨 HOLY SMOKES: ICE agents in Maine just photographed a civilian’s face and name and said they’re putting it in a database.When the woman asked why, the agent’s response was basically: “Now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”This is intimidation. Not law enforcement. pic.twitter.com/68dEiVd2wa

Whether the two were actually registered in an ICE database is unclear. But the agency is definitely using facial identification tech in at least some ways. Back in October of last year, 404 Media reported that ICE was scanning suspects’ faces to check whether they were citizens, a development which Cato Institute senior fellow Patrick Eddington warned at the time could cascade into a constitutional crisis.

If what the officer in the video says is true, the agency may be using the tech for even further overreach.

In a case flagged by journalist Julie DiCaro, a Minnesota woman alleged in a legal filing that an ICE agent approached her vehicle as she was observing them, addressed her by name, and warned her that ICE had “facial recognition technology.” Three days later, the woman says she received a notice that her Global Entry or TSA-Pre Check status had been revoked.

            <div id="article-text">The Heritage Foundation — the think tank behind the infamous Project 2025 policy wishlist, which dragged down Trump’s most recent reelection campaign with its massively unpopular proposals — apparently has a new priority: rounding up the unmarried people and shipping them off to camps.

As NBC News reports, the Heritage Foundation is pushing the White House to pass initiatives to financially reward newlyweds, create deeper tax incentives for married couples, discourage online dating — paradoxically, it would seem — and even start opening government-run “marriage bootcamps.”

According to the Heritage Foundation’s framework, called “Saving America by Saving the Family,” the camps would serve as reeducation centers for unmarried couples.

“Successful completion of the program would mean that couples are ready to walk down the aisle at a communal wedding by the end of the bootcamp,” the organization’s screed declares. “The bride and groom would also be matched with a mentor couple to help them to navigate the highs and lows of early married life.”

There’d also be cold, hard cash involved.

“The most innovative aspect of such a program, however, would be to add a monetary incentive for couples to get — and stay — married,” the framework continues. “For example, each couple that completes the program could receive a ‘wedding bonus’ of up to $5,000 on their wedding day to be paid through foundations or private donors, not government funds.”

According to NBC, the total cost of the Saving America by Saving the Family initiative would be $280 billion over the next decade. As to whether taxpayers would pick up the bill, the Heritage Foundation’s documentation notes that the federal government has previously earmarked money for “marriage education programs.”

“A modest investment, I think, [which] will pay off tremendous dividends,” Heritage Foundation vice president of economic and domestic policy Roger Severino told NBC.

“We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair,” the budget airline’s chief Michael O’Leary said at a news conference in Dublin on Wednesday, as quoted by CNN. “And we want to thank him sincerely for the additional publicity.”

The trash talking began last week when the Irish airline, the largest in Europe, said it wouldn’t install its fleet with Starlink technology, a satellite-based internet service operated by Musk’s company SpaceX. O’Leary claimed that the Starlink antennas would add drag to the planes and drive up fuel costs.

Musk could barely hide the sting he felt from the snub. He initially responded by calling O’Leary “misinformed” and added that he doubted Ryanair “can even measure the difference in fuel use accurately.”

Smelling controversy, O’Leary went on a interview with the Irish radio station Newstalk to taunt the world’s richest man.

“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” O’Leary said. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot. What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”

Musk, naturally, took the bait. O’Leary was no longer merely “misinformed,” but a “retarded twat who needs to be fired,” he seethed in response to the official Ryanair X account joking that wifi on planes was a scam.

Musk even threatened to buy out the airliner and posted a poll asking his fans whether he should “restore Ryan as their rightful ruler” once he does. Clearly, Grok was not consulted before putting up the poll: the “Ryan” Musk is presumably referring to is the Irish billionaire Tony Ryan, who died in 2007.

O’Leary didn’t back down. Tagging Musk’s account, the Ryanair account announced that it was launching a “Great Idiots seat sale” dedicated to “Elon and any other idiots on ‘X,&#39;” and that O’Leary would be giving a press conference “to address (undress??)” Musk’s “latest Twitshit.” (Yes, they went there.)

“The insufferable, special needs chimp currently running Ryan Air is an accountant,” he fumed in response to the announcement. “Has no idea how airplanes even fly.”

Ryanair and its CEO, not unlike Musk, are no strangers to controversy and often actively court it. Musk, though, is being thoroughly outdone at his own shtick. At the Wednesday conference, O’Leary gloated about the success of the “Big Idiot Seat Sale” and said he wasn’t bothered by Musk’s tirades.

“As anybody with teenage children would know, you’re frequently called an idiot and a twat at home,” he said, per CNN. “I don’t need to go outside to be insulted.”

He also said that while only European citizens could own European airlines, Musk was welcome to pour money into the company. “We would think it’s a very good investment, certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he is earning on X.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s an agonizing time for the labor market in the US, where unemployment is on the rise and wages are stagnant. Though there’s raging debate over what degree of blame AI holds for the sorry state of the job market, one thing’s for sure:workers are growing increasingly furious with the tech, which they perceive as undercutting what little job security they had.

Business leaders, as a result, are becoming anxious about the blowback — even as they rhapsodize about the coming AI revolution.

At the World Monetary Fund summit at Davos, for instance, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva launched into a talk on AI by calling it a “major factor for economic growth.”

“We see potential to up of 0.8 percent boost to growth over the next years, but it is hitting the labor market like a tsunami, and most countries and most businesses are not prepared for it,” she fretted.

Her anxious comments come after a year of dramatic layoffs and hiring slowdowns, in which major firms have often pointed at AI. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, for example, said in September that he’d cut 4,000 customer support jobs because he “needs less heads” thanks to automation. In October, Amazon initiated its largest round of layoffs ever, slashing 14,000 office jobs while citing AI as a major factor.

It should come as no surprise to those same business leaders that John Q. Public is growing increasingly angry over the narrative that AI is taking its jobs.

In its Global Talent Trends 2026 report flagged by CNBC, the analytics firm Mercer found that shop-floor concerns about AI-fueled job loss have surged from 28 percent in 2024 to 40 percent in 2026.

The firm’s research also found that 62 percent of employees feel their leaders underestimate the psychological and emotional impact of AI. And why shouldn’t they? Executives have spent the last year bragging about the supposed AI revolution, rhetoric they’ve used to game enough investment dollars to fundamentally alter the US economy.

Workers, in turn, shouldn’t be blamed for taking their lead — though in today’s economy, it seems they’re the only ones expected to pay the price.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/legal-ai-giant-harvey-acquires-hexus-as-competition-heats-up-in-legal-tech/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Harvey, the high-flying legal AI startup, has acquired Hexus — a two-year-old startup that builds tools for creating product demos, videos, and guides — as the company continues its aggressive expansion amid fierce competition in the legal tech market.

Hexus founder and CEO Sakshi Pratap, who previously held engineering roles at Walmart, Oracle, and Google, tells TechCrunch that her San Francisco-based team has already joined Harvey, while the startup’s India-based engineers will come onboard once Harvey establishes a Bangalore office. Pratap adds that she will lead an engineering team focused on accelerating Harvey’s offerings for in-house legal departments.

“What we’re bringing to Harvey is deep experience building enterprise AI tools in adjacent problem spaces,” Pratap said. “This expertise helps Harvey move faster in a market that’s becoming increasingly competitive.”

Hexus had raised $1.6 million from Pear VC, Liquid 2 Ventures, and angel investors before the acquisition. While Pratap declined to share deal terms, she said the structure was aligned around “long-term team incentives.”

The acquisition comes as Harvey looks to cement its position as one of AI’s hottest startups. The company confirmed last fall that it’s now valued at $8 billion after raising $160 million, bringing its funding across 2025 to $760 million. Andreessen Horowitz led that newest round, joined by new investors T. Rowe Price and WndrCo, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Conviction, and angel investor Elad Gil. (It started the year with a $3 billion valuation after Sequoia led a $300 million Series D round in the company.)

Harvey now claims more than 1,000 clients across 60 countries, including a majority of the top 10 U.S. law firms.

When TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Winston Weinberg in November, he traced Harvey’s origin story back to a cold email sent to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Weinberg, then a first-year associate at O’Melveny & Myers, and co-founder Gabe Pereyra, a researcher who worked at Google DeepMind and Meta and was Weinberg’s roommate at the time, tested GPT-3 on landlord-tenant law questions from Reddit. When they showed the AI-generated answers to attorneys, two out of three said they’d send 86 of 100 responses with zero edits.

“That was the moment when we were like, wow, this entire industry can be transformed by this technology,” Weinberg said.

They emailed Altman on July 4, 2022, got on a call that same morning, and landed their first check from the OpenAI Startup Fund shortly after. According to Weinberg, the OpenAI Startup Fund remains Harvey’s second-largest investor.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/apple-iphone-just-had-its-best-year-in-india-as-the-smartphone-market-stays-broadly-flat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s iPhone is gaining ground fast in India, shipping about 14 million units in 2025, based on market data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.

Yet the country’s overall smartphone market stayed largely flat at around 152–153 million devices. That means that across the full-year of 2025, Apple’s market share of shipments rose to a record 9%. This is up from 7% in 2024, Counterpoint Research data shows, making it the iPhone’s strongest year yet in the world’s second-largest smartphone market by volume.

The gains were driven by the iPhone’s product portfolio, growing aspirational demand and wider availability across sales channels, Counterpoint Research’s director for devices and ecosystems, Tarun Pathak, said.

Apple has repeatedly pointed to India as a standout market in recent quarters, with CEO Tim Cook saying the company set an “all-time revenue record in India” on its last earnings call in October. CFO Kevan Parekh also said iPhone’s active install base hit an all-time high in India and the company set a quarterly record for upgraders, highlighting Apple’s push to expand its user base beyond just new buyers, though the company did not disclose detailed figures for India on the call.

Beyond shipments, Apple has been widening its footprint in India by ramping up local manufacturing and broadening its retail reach. Last month, the company opened its fifth Apple Store in the country — its first in Noida — as part of a broader retail expansion that began in 2023.

Apple is also sharpening its services pitch in India. Earlier this month, it introduced Apple Creator Studio — a subscription bundle of creative apps such as Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro — priced at ₹399 a month ($4.35) in India. That’s around 66% cheaper than the $12.99 a month it charges in the U.S., underscoring how the company is tailoring pricing to deepen its reach in the country.

That strong iPhone year came against a market that has largely stopped growing. India is set to log its fourth straight year at about the same shipment level of 152 million units, Counterpoint estimates, with the October–December quarter down 8–10% year-over-year despite the festive season.

Longer replacement cycles, fewer feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, and the growing popularity of refurbished devices are among the key reasons the market has struggled to grow, Pathak told TechCrunch.

Even as overall shipments stagnated, India’s premium segment continued to expand. Smartphones priced above ₹30,000 (around $327) grew 15% year-over-year in 2025 and accounted for a record 23% of total shipments — the highest share ever — according to Counterpoint.

That shift has helped brands with stronger premium portfolios, including Apple, gain ground even as the mass market slowed.

By volume, China’s Vivo led India’s smartphone market in 2025 with a 23% share of shipments, per Counterpoint, followed by Samsung at 15% and Xiaomi at 13%.

Apple remained outside India’s top three by shipments despite its record year, underlining how the market is still dominated by mass-market Android brands even as premium devices take a growing share.

Counterpoint expects India’s smartphone market to slip about 2% in 2026, warning that rising memory prices could squeeze demand in the sub-₹15,000 (under-$170) segment and force phone makers to cut cashback offers, trim specifications or raise prices. Even so, average selling prices are forecast to rise 5% in 2026 after a 9% increase in 2025, suggesting the premiumization trend is set to continue.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

            <h2>TikTok users freak out over app’s ‘immigration status’ collection — here’s what it means</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/tiktok-users-freak-out-over-apps-immigration-status-collection-heres-what-it-means/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the change in TikTok ownership, TikTok users in the U.S. are collectively freaking out over the company’s updated privacy policy after being alerted to the changes through an in-app message. The revised document details the U.S. joint venture’s conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are also posting to social media about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.”

But despite the panic, this disclosure isn’t new — and it doesn’t mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy before the ownership deal closed, and it’s primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California’s Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what “sensitive information” is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps’ policies.

To understand why users are concerned — and why the policy reads this way — it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.

Specifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users’ content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their “racial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.”

It’s not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.

The escalation of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has led to widespread protests across the country, which have now come to a head in Minnesota. On Friday, hundreds of businesses closed their doors in an economic blackout to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the state. The move follows weeks of clashes between Minnesota residents and ICE agents, which have led to thousands of arrests and the death of American citizen Renée Good.

But the privacy policy language predates these concerns. In TikTok’s earlier policy, updated on August 19, 2024, the company explained that some of the information it collects and uses may “constitute sensitive personal information” under state privacy laws.

It then proceeded to list those same categories as examples. The legal reason is straightforward.

The policy’s specificity around types of “sensitive information” has to do with state privacy laws, like California’s California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The latter, for instance, requires businesses to inform consumers when they collect “sensitive information,” which the law defines as including things like:

Of note, citizenship and immigration status were specifically added to the category of “sensitive personal information” when California Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-947 into law on October 8, 2023.

Because of the in-app alert timed to the deal’s closure (a requirement because of the new legal entity), many people are now reading through TikTok’s terms for the first time. Seeing this language and fearing the worst, they are posting to social media about their concerns and warning others; some are even threatening to delete their accounts.

But what TikTok’s policy is actually saying is that, as part of operating its app, it may process sensitive information — especially if it’s the subject of someone’s video — and that it’s agreeing to process that sensitive information “in accordance with applicable law.”

The policy even references the CCPA by name, as an example of the applicable laws TikTok is agreeing to.

“TikTok is required under those laws to notify users in the privacy policy that the sensitive personal information is being collected, how it is being used, and with whom it is being shared,” explains Jennifer Daniels, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome, where she provides counsel on regulatory and general corporate law matters.

Her colleague, Philip Yannella, co-chair of Blank Rome’s Privacy, Security, and Data Protection Practice, points out that TikTok likely decided to include this language in its privacy policy because of litigation concerns. For instance, he says that lately, he has seen several demands under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) from plaintiffs’ lawyers who alleged “the collection of racial, immigration, and ethnic data.”

A similar type of disclosure to TikTok’s can be found in other social media apps, though some companies keep the explanations more high-level, while others, like TikTok, will list out the precise categories that are legally defined as “sensitive information” for additional clarity.

Still, at least one lawyer consulted by TechCrunch noted that spelling out these specific sensitive details so precisely can actually make things less clear to the end users.

As a point of comparison, Meta’s privacy policy gets fairly granular, too, though it doesn’t specifically include “immigration status” as one of its examples of sensitive information:

Users on social media often share deeply personal topics, explains Ashlee Difuntorum, an associate at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir (KHIKS) and a business litigator with experience representing software and technology companies.

“TikTok is essentially saying that if you disclose something sensitive, that information becomes part of the content the platform technically ‘collects,’” she tells TechCrunch. “Policies like this often look alarming because they’re written for regulators and litigators, not for ordinary consumers. That said, the wording can understandably strike users as intrusive when it’s laid out so bluntly.”

TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.

Of course, sharing content on social media sites isn’t without risk, particularly under authoritarian governments that target their own citizens. These apps collect gobs of data, and governments can enact laws to gain access to it.

Ironically, the decision to move TikTok’s U.S. operations to the U.S. under new ownership was due to this exact concern, but with China then seen as the potential threat.

Chinese laws require companies to assist with state intelligence and data security, including its 2017 National Intelligence Law and its 2021 Data Security Law. The fear among U.S. lawmakers was that TikTok’s ownership by a Chinese entity, ByteDance, could put U.S. citizens at risk, either via surveillance or subtle changes to the app’s algorithm designed to influence people or promote Chinese propaganda.

Now, people in the U.S. are more worried about their own government’s potential surveillance rather than China’s.

            <h2>Who’s behind AMI Labs, Yann LeCun’s ‘world model’ startup</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/whos-behind-ami-labs-yann-lecuns-world-model-startup/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yann LeCun’s new venture, AMI Labs, has drawn intense attention since the AI scientist left Meta to found it. This week, the startup finally confirmed what it’s building — and several key details have been hiding in plain sight.

On its newly launched website, the startup disclosed its plans to develop “world models” in order to “build intelligent systems that understand the real world.” The focus on world models was already hinted at by AMI’s name, which stands for Advanced Machine Intelligence, but it has now officially joined the ranks of the hottest AI research startups.

Building foundational models that bridge AI and the real world has become one of the field’s most exciting pursuits, attracting top scientists and deep-pocketed investors alike — product or no product.

World Labs, a direct rival founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, became a unicorn shortly after coming out of stealth. After launching its first product, Marble, which generates physically sound 3D worlds, World Labs is now reportedly in talks to raise fresh funding at a valuation of $5 billion.

There’s little doubt that VCs would be equally eager to invest in LeCun, adding credibility to rumors that AMI Labs might be raising funding at a $3.5 billion valuation. According to Bloomberg, VCs in talks with the startup include Cathay Innovation, Greycroft, and Hiro Capital, to which LeCun is an advisor. Other potential investors reportedly include 20VC, Bpifrance, Daphni, and HV Capital.

Regardless of who writes the checks, investors may want to note an important detail: As LeCun has made clear, he is AMI’s executive chairman, not its CEO. Instead, that role belongs to Alex LeBrun, previously co-founder and CEO at Nabla, a health AI startup with offices in Paris and New York.

LeBrun’s transition from Nabla to AMI is part of a partnership announced last December by Nabla, which develops AI assistants for clinical care and to which LeCun has been an advisor. In exchange for “privileged access” to AMI’s world models, Nabla’s board supported LeBrun’s shift from CEO to chief AI scientist and chairman, clearing the way for his new role.

As AMI Labs’ CEO, LeBrun will be surrounded by familiar faces. After Facebook acquired his previous startup, Wit.ai, the serial entrepreneur and AI engineer worked under LeCun’s leadership at Meta’s AI research laboratory, FAIR. According to reports, the duo will also be joined by Laurent Solly, who stepped down as Meta’s vice president for Europe last December.

The talent overlap between AMI and Meta likely won’t stop there. LeCun told the MIT Technology Review that his former employer could well be AMI’s first client. But he has also been publicly critical of some of Meta’s strategic choices made under Mark Zuckerberg’s direction. More broadly, the Review interprets AMI Labs as a contrarian bet against large language models (LLMs).

The limitations of LLMs that LeCun has pointed out include hallucinations, which are a serious concern in contexts like medicine, as LeBrun also knows firsthand. AMI Labs’ CEO told Forbes that a big reason he took the role was the prospect of applying its world models to healthcare. But the startup will also target other high-stakes applied fields.

“AMI Labs will advance AI research and develop applications where reliability, controllability, and safety really matter, especially for industrial process control, automation, wearable devices, robotics, healthcare, and beyond,” it wrote in its mission statement. “We share one belief: real intelligence does not start in language. It starts in the world.”

Unlike generative approaches, which LeCun and his team see as poorly suited for unpredictable data such as sensor input, the startup promises that its AI systems will not only understand the real world, but also have persistent memory, the ability to reason and plan, and be controllable and safe.

The startup plans to license its technology to industry partners for real-life applications, but says it also plans to contribute to building the future of AI “with the global academic research community via open publications and open source.” LeCun said he plans to keep his professor position at NYU, where he teaches one class per year and supervises PhD and postdoctoral students.

This means that the French-born researcher will remain based in New York, but he told the MIT Technology Review that AMI Labs “is going to be a global company [that’s] headquartered in Paris.” The news was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who expressed his pride that LeCun, who is also a Turing Prize winner, chose Paris. “We will do everything we can to ensure his success from France,” he said.

The startup will also have offices in Montreal, New York, and Singapore, but its decision to pick Paris for its headquarters will help consolidate Paris’ reputation as an AI hub, where it will join the ranks of H, Mistral AI and several international labs, including FAIR. It’s fitting, perhaps, that AMI is pronounced a-mee — like “ami” in French, which means “friend,” LeCun has pointed out.

            <h2>Waymo probed by National Transportation Safety Board over illegal school bus behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.

The NTSB is specifically focusing on the more than 20 incidents that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.

“Investigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,” the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.

It’s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it’s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.

Waymo also issued a software recall last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas — where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera — the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.

The new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.

“We safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.”

The NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.

The first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus’ right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.

Waymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.

But as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company’s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions.

“We continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,” Peña said.

            <h2>The Rippling/Deel corporate spying scandal may have taken another wild turn</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/the-rippling-deel-corporate-spying-scandal-may-have-taken-another-wild-turn/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into HR and payroll startup Deel over allegations that it hired a corporate spy to leak information on its biggest rival, Rippling, reports The Wall Street Journal.

In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, Deel says that it is “not aware of any investigation. We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries.”

Deel’s statement then makes its own allegations against Rippling. It points to its own lawsuit that alleges its rival has been on a “smear campaign,” claiming it’s beating the competitor in the market, and adding, “the truth will win in court.” Rippling declined comment.

This is arguably the biggest drama between two HR startups ever.

To recap, Rippling sued Deel in May, and revised the suit in June, alleging that its rival planted a corporate spy. The Rippling employee was caught in a sting operation and confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in an Irish court via a sworn written statement that reads like a Hollywood movie. The employee testified that he took Rippling’s sales leads, product roadmaps, customer account info, names of superstar employees, whatever was asked for, and handed it over to Deel executives.

Rippling’s suit, which is ongoing, charged its rival with violations of the federal racketeering law (known as the RICO statute and typically used against organized crime) among other laws it cited. But despite using phrases like “criminal syndicate,” this was a civil suit, not a criminal prosecution.

Deel countersuited Rippling, also alleging spying by impersonating a customer, among other claims.

The man who confessed to spying agreed to testify in Rippling’s case, and Rippling agreed to pay him for legal and travel expenses, according to the man’s cooperation agreement released as a court document and seen by TechCrunch. Deel is now calling the man Rippling’s “paid witness.”

But the man also went back to court alleging that his family was living in terror because he believed men from Deel were following him. Deel’s lawyer initially denied this but later discovered that Deel did hire surveillance.

Rippling scored the most recent win, at the end of November, when it obtained bank records. The records indicated that Deel transferred funds into an account held by the wife of Deel’s COO, and 56 seconds later that account transferred the same amount to an account held by the confessed spy.

In the meantime, another court document shows that Deel’s founder and CEO Alexandre Bouaziz, who has been called “the mastermind” of the spying plot in Rippling’s lawsuit, has hired high-powered lawyer William Frentzen to represent him. Frentzen is a partner with Morrison Foerster’s white-collar defense group and was formerly the chief of the corporate and securities fraud unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.

Rippling’s lawyer is none other than Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office who is known for his big personality and long list of celeb clients, ranging from Elon Musk to Jay-Z.

So it’s all sounding like a plot from a John Grisham novel, with a sprinkle of the show “Suits” on top.

None of this has stopped investors from backing Deel or Rippling. In October, Deel announced it hit a $17.3 billion valuation after raising $300 million led by Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Rippling hit a $16.8 billion valuation in May after raising $450 million from investors like Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Y Combinator.

            <h2>Police and ICE Agents Are on a Collision Course</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-minnesota-police-dhs/685736/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, the Department of Justice released a blistering report on the patterns and practices of the Minneapolis Police Department. The police force responsible for George Floyd’s death three years earlier, the DOJ wrote, regularly “uses unreasonable deadly force,” “unlawfully retaliates against people who observe and record their activities,” and “fails to adequately discipline police misconduct.” The department also engaged in the “inherently dangerous and almost always counterproductive” practice of shooting at moving cars. In one case, an officer who had the time and space to move out of the path of an escaping vehicle instead fired four shots at it. The officer’s use of force, the report said, “was reckless and unreasonable.”

The Justice Department this month opted against conducting an investigation into the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was killed after an ICE officer fired shots into her moving Honda Pilot. The government is instead reportedly pushing to probe the actions of Good’s wife, who recorded the incident on her phone. For local police in Minneapolis—who have spent much of the past five years aiming to overhaul their tactics and restore community trust by embracing an ethos of deescalation—watching thousands of federal agents rush into their city with a very different mandate has been disorienting, current and former law-enforcement officials told me.

“Look at how much things change,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told me when I asked him about the 2023 DOJ report and the current federal operation. “Now we’re the ones trying to honor people’s rights, honor people’s ability to yell at us, to protest, to record the police and say nasty things without escalating, trying to protect people’s human dignity in interactions. It’s incredibly ironic.”

O’Hara has had little time to dwell on the irony, as his force of about 600 officers faces a crisis spurred by President Trump’s decision to deploy some 3,000 federal agents to Minneapolis. In a city that has long been beset by strained relations between residents and law enforcement, the largest operation in the history of the Department of Homeland Security is upending what had begun to feel like a fragile truce.

Police now say they fear that Minneapolis may be on the verge of repeating the downward spiral that began in 2020, when a videotaped killing of an unarmed man by law enforcement led to mass protests that turned violent. A spike in crime and an exodus of hundreds of burned-out officers from the force followed. O’Hara told me that his effort to rebuild is being stymied by the “undisciplined,” “unsafe,” and “unprofessional” policing of federal agents who seem hell-bent on antagonizing anyone objecting to their presence in the city.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino complained on Thursday that Minneapolis police have been “missing in action,” failing to show up when protesters have amassed to hamper federal operations. Vice President Vance visited Minneapolis hours later and blamed local authorities for the chaos gripping the city.

It is rare for law-enforcement officers to turn on each other so publicly, and Minneapolis may represent the beginning of a broader rupture between local police—many of whom have years of experience dealing with the public—and federal officers bolstered by a corps of hastily trained recruits.

“Folks, that’s bush-league policing,” Sheriff Kevin Joyce of Cumberland County, Maine, told reporters on Thursday after one of his corrections officers was arrested by a group of ICE agents, who left the man’s car open and unlocked on the street. “We don’t do that as law-enforcement officers.”

In Minnesota, police have also begun to speak out against the aggressive tactics that have become synonymous with Operation Metro Surge, the nickname for the federal deployment many residents have said has begun to feel like an invasion. Police chiefs from the Twin Cities and surrounding communities held a press conference this week to accuse ICE agents of unprofessional and unconstitutional practices. They asserted that their own off-duty officers had been accosted by masked federal officials and asked to prove that they were U.S. citizens. Area 911 switchboards are receiving dozens of daily calls related to the federal surge, both from residents seeking protection from federal agents and from ICE officials asking for help amid protests. The tension could increase if Trump follows through on his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into the city.

The Pentagon put 1,500 members of the 11th Airborne Division, based out of Fort Wainwright, Alaska, on prepare-to-deploy orders Sunday morning, with plans to possibly send them to Minnesota, a U.S. defense official told my colleague Nancy A. Youssef. This person also said that the U.S. Army has ordered several dozen additional active-duty military police based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and troops from the 4th Infantry Division in Fort Carson, Colorado, to prepare for a possible deployment to Minneapolis. The orders are the penultimate step to a Minnesota deployment, but the troops have not been ordered to go anywhere just yet. Vance said Thursday that Trump has not felt compelled to use the Insurrection Act so far and that the administration’s goal is to lower the temperature.

Tensions in Minneapolis have escalated significantly since January 7, when Ross shot and killed Good. The 37-year-old mother of three had stopped her car on a street when Ross and other ICE officers approached her. Video shows that she’d turned her steering wheel away from the officers in an apparent attempt to leave when the shots were fired. Trump-administration officials promptly accused Good of “domestic terrorism” and said she had been trying to run over Ross.

Despite videos and eyewitness accounts of the incident that contradict those claims, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News recently that no investigation into Ross’s actions would be conducted. That’s a break with precedent; fatal law-enforcement shootings are typically reviewed. Federal officials also boxed out Minnesota investigators from examining the evidence independently, a move that local activists have said amounts to a cover-up. In Minneapolis, where demonstrators saw the successful prosecutions of the officers who’d killed Floyd as the culmination of years of public pressure on a police force that often seemed impervious to accountability, the handling of the Good shooting feels like an unacceptable regression.

“The longer this takes to get answers around whether there will be accountability, the worse things will get,” Nekima Levy Armstrong, a local activist and the former head of the Minneapolis NAACP, told me last week. “ICE agents will continue to feel that they can attack people in our community with impunity.” On Sunday, Armstrong participated in a protest at a Minneapolis church where an ICE official apparently serves as a pastor. On Thursday, she was arrested by federal agents, and Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that the protest broke a law protecting houses of worship. Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, called the prosecution “a farce.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who called for Armstrong to be released immediately, has been warning that the federal officials’ aggressive tactics are creating a sense of chaos. Last week, he told reporters that some residents were asking local police to fight ICE officers on the street. “We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,” he said, adding that the situation is “not sustainable.”

But in the current environment, the idea of cops and agents coming to blows may not be far-fetched. In Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, just outside Minneapolis, an off-duty police officer was stopped by ICE agents while driving and was asked to show papers proving her legal right to be in the U.S., Police Chief Mark Bruley said recently. An agent knocked a phone out of her hand when she tried to record, he said. The federal officials, who had their guns drawn during the encounter, left only when the officer told them that she was also in law enforcement, Bruley said. He added that similar things had happened to several other officers on his force, and that “every one of these individuals is a person of color.” (DHS has said that there is no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning an officer and that it does not racially profile.)

The corrections officer in Cumberland County, Maine, was roughed up by at least three federal agents as he shouted that he worked for the government, according to video of the arrest posted by the Portland Press Herald. Janeé Harteau, a former police chief in Minneapolis, told me that she had recently traveled from Florida to Minnesota to protect her daughter, a 27-year-old Hispanic U.S. citizen, from racial profiling by ICE. Her daughter had “grown up around cops” but now feared leaving her house after seeing videos of federal officials aggressively confronting minorities, Harteau said.

In 2021, Minneapolis officers began a training program called “Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement,” which teaches police how to intervene when their colleagues are abusing people. Shortly before Operation Metro Surge began, MPD revised its policy to clarify that officers who see federal agents using “clearly excessive force” against residents “shall verbally or physically intervene” as soon as they can do so safely.

In recent days, videos and images of actions by federal agents have circulated widely. The incidents include a woman being yanked from her car and carried away while saying she is disabled and trying to get to a doctor’s appointment, a U.S. citizen being pulled from his house in his underwear despite snowy conditions, and a man taken from his home after gun-toting officers used a battering ram on his door. (They did not produce a judicial warrant before entering, his lawyer said.) The front page of yesterday’s Minnesota Star Tribune features a photo of two agents pinning an activist down while another masked officer sprays an orange chemical irritant directly into the person’s face.

“Their tactics are unsound,” Harteau said. “I question their training, if any. We don’t train people to just push people, grab their phones, mace them because they’re standing on the corner talking or yelling.”

The Trump administration has responded by defending the federal operations as flawless and labeling critics as lawless agitators and supporters of domestic terrorism. Marcos Charles, a top ICE official, recently told CBS’s 60 Minutes that no one from his agency had been disciplined for any actions that have taken place during the operation. Trump and Vance have each softened their tone in recent days, acknowledging that some “mistakes” have been made by federal forces.

When I asked the White House about some of the complaints from local law-enforcement officials, the spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not address those concerns, instead pivoting to blame Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Frey for “lying about federal law enforcement operations” and “fueling divisions.” The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Vance said on Thursday that he had personally looked into some of the situations showing ICE personnel involved in questionable conduct and found that crucial context exonerating the officers was often missing. He blamed local leaders for not allowing Minneapolis police to assist with the federal surge.

“The reason why things have gotten so out of hand is because of a failure of cooperation between the state and local authorities and what these guys are trying to do,” he said, standing in front of 10 immigration agents. Although Vance said he had “some hope” that cooperation would improve in the coming weeks, there’s reason to believe that such optimism is misguided.

After interviewing dozens of Minneapolis residents, politicians, and police officers for our book about the life and legacy of George Floyd, my co-author, Robert Samuels, and I came to understand just how fraught the relationship between the community and MPD had become in the years leading up to the fiery summer of 2020. Long before the Justice Department documented the civil-rights abuses and unconstitutional policing practices MPD had become notorious for, we heard about them from residents. The city’s poorest and most ethnically diverse neighborhoods, where ICE is now conducting many of its deportation operations, tended to be the most likely to have stories of the cops roughing up people without justification.

Having heard so many accounts of residents who had endured or witnessed such abuse, I understood why so many protesters flooded the streets of Minneapolis in the hours after Floyd was killed. Some of them watched with a sense of satisfaction on May 28, 2020, as flames engulfed the building housing MPD’s Third Precinct, which was especially notorious for aggressive policing techniques that resemble the tactics ICE agents are now using. And in the years since, Minneapolis police have worked to address that anger and to change the culture of their department.

With crime settling at historic lows, local leaders are reluctant to return to the aggressive approaches that soured relations with the community. Bruley, the Brooklyn Park police chief, said that local officials have recently begun handing out pamphlets to residents showing them how to tell the difference between an ICE agent and a municipal officer—lest the federal deportation push tarnish “our brand of how hard we work to build trust.”

Leaders in the Twin Cities are well aware that Operation Metro Surge will wind down at some point and that ICE, flush with billions of dollars from Congress and a mandate to hire thousands of new deportation officers, will shift its focus to another location. For O’Hara, whose police force lost roughly 300 officers after the George Floyd protests and continues to struggle with staffing and recruitment, the prospect of another conflagration in the streets stemming from ICE’s operation is unnerving.

“We’ve tried to heal, and we’ve tried to rebuild,” he told me. “I’m just afraid that we’re in that pandemic phase now, just waiting for the next time to go completely over the cliff. And we just cannot sustain if that happens again.”</div>

            <h2>The ‘One Other Thing’ That Comes With Every Trump-Era Dinner</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/rollins-dinner-tortilla-broccoli/685741/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first, we didn’t think much of it, the One Other Thing. When Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins suggested a meal of one corn tortilla, one piece of broccoli, one piece of chicken, and “one other thing”—all for a mere $3–we dwelled more on the other parts.

The one corn tortilla, the unit of broccoli, the piece of chicken! How strange and bland a combination! How stingy in contrast to the birthday steaks our leaders enjoyed! If we’d only known then. Corn tortilla. Broccoli. Chicken. And one other thing. Maybe a carrot! Maybe a bit of cheese! We assumed that it had to be food. That was our mistake, I think. Assuming that the One Other Thing had to be food.

And at first, after we signed on to receive the Recommended Meal, it was food. A mint. Some popcorn. An almond. Nothing too surprising. On the fifth night, we let the baby open it. He put it into his mouth immediately, and I had to fish it out. Something hard and black. That was when we noticed that it was coal. A lump of coal. He laughed, but we were unsettled. What had we signed up for?

After that, for a week, it was normal things. A gummy vitamin, a single blueberry, a small packet of relish.

Following the news of victory in the protein war, the One Other Thing seemed to be in a celebratory vein. It was protein every day: a scoop of whey; a bar full of nuts; a dry, pistachio-flavored cube.

But this was not to last. After the protein, we got something folded up in a thick envelope. “What is it, Mama?” my kids kept asking. I unfolded it and discovered what appeared to be a health plan? But it was only two pages long, and that included the cover page.

Sometimes, at least, it was something we could use around the house: an eraser shaped like the Statue of Liberty; tape; exactly five pencils. Once, it was a little origami replica of Mike Johnson. I don’t think it was edible, but the craftsmanship was very impressive.

For a while, the Thing was something to do with Greenland. A bit of torn-up charter; rocks; ice; a flake of mineral so small, it blew away when I tried to get a closer look. Now that’s over. I hope. Hope has been a mistake when it comes to the One Other Thing.

It’s been getting worse and worse. One night, a stamp with the president’s face on it. Another night, a discarded penny, now no longer legal tender.

The next night, the tinfoil contained a miniature wooden horse that sounded empty when I tapped it but, when I looked again, had opened and sent tiny soldiers swarming over the broccoli. They would have carried it off had I not acted quickly and placed a cup over them. Then a plastic retainer case with J. D. Vance’s Soul lettered on it. The next night, the scent of a woman’s perfume. The night following, a human tooth?

I began to dread the One Other Thing. I kept praying that it would be something we wanted, as simple as ketchup for the broccoli, or mustard for the chicken. A sauce of some kind.

The past few days, when I have gone to open it, nothing has been inside. Nothing I can see, at any rate. The foil is empty but smells of sulphur. All I get is a feeling of existential dread, like a giant fist tightening around my chest, every time I unwrap the foil packaging. Each day, it sits there at the corner of the plate, steaming, in its tinfoil. Waiting. And I know I have to look. Corn tortilla. Broccoli. Chicken. And One Other Thing. There is no escape from the One Other Thing.</div>

            <div id="article-text">My local Target was the first place I noticed the shift. One day, a few years ago, a sign appeared: red text on white paper announcing that no one under 18 would be allowed in without an adult. Before the poster, every weekday afternoon, clots of teens would move through the arteries of the store, occasionally blocking them. The kids would laugh among themselves, swatch makeup on their arms, peruse the candy offerings. I suppose they made the shopping experience a little more chaotic, but I personally never saw them do anything worse than talk loudly, or loiter in the way of someone trying to reach the face wash. They reminded me of me and my friends when I was young—hanging out in a store just for something to do, somewhere to be. And then the sign went up, and the teens disappeared.

My Target is just one of many U.S. businesses that have issued restrictions in recent years on unaccompanied minors. These policies are frequently enacted in places where teens like to congregate, such as malls, restaurants, movie theaters, and theme parks. Some places ban teens entirely, or just on certain days or during certain hours. Comprehensive data on how many businesses have these rules are hard to come by. But the anecdotes are piling up. Kathleen Blum, who leads shopper insights at the market-research firm C+R Research, told me that she’s seen “an uptick” in such policies over the past few years.

In some places, minors are also subject to new curfews. Last year, for example, both Cincinnati and Washington, D.C., instituted curfew zones in busy neighborhoods, beginning at 6 p.m. in D.C. and 9 p.m. in Cincinnati. Chicago began banning youth from downtown Millennium Park after 6 p.m. on weekends in 2022. According to the Marshall Project, “more than a dozen cities and counties” established or started enforcing curfew laws in 2023. Adolescents are the obvious target of such policies, because they are far more likely than younger kids to be out unaccompanied.

All of these constraints significantly erode teens’ ability to participate in society. They compound the well-documented problem of teen loneliness and poor mental health. And they are a reflection of an adult society that resists taking responsibility for, or even tolerating the presence of, children in public.

Neither curfew laws nor business bans are brand-new phenomena. Steven Mintz, a historian of childhood at the University of Texas at Austin, told me that curfew laws in particular have ebbed and flowed over the decades with the anxieties of the times. Sometimes, he said, such policies are motivated by a desire to protect children from danger or substance use; other times, they stem from fear of what unsupervised teens might do.

This latest wave of restrictions seems to rest on the questionable assumption that teens are inherently a threat and that banning them would instill order. Some of the recent curfews were enacted or enforced after violence broke out at large gatherings of young people. Blum said that, in her experience, a major reason that businesses ban unchaperoned youth is to prevent shoplifting—and businesses have reported an increase in shoplifting incidents over the past few years, in National Retail Federation surveys. Perhaps wholesale bans feel justified to those who make them, given that children are still developing and teens’ brains can make them impulsive. But young people are not the only ones who commit violence and not the only ones who shoplift. And recent research on child development challenges the widely held idea that adolescents are universally more risk-seeking than adults, suggesting that this is true of only a subset of youth. Evidence does not support the idea that juvenile curfews reduce crime. Policies that restrict all teens also risk being selectively enforced in practice due to racial profiling and other biases. Research has shown that curfews lead to disproportionate arrests of Black and Native American youth.

Another misapprehension lies underneath many of these bans: the idea that the presence of teens in itself creates a disturbance. Some businesses have explicitly cited a desire to minimize disruption as the reason for denying entrance to unaccompanied minors. The offending behaviors range from serious concerns such as fights and vandalism to the comparatively mild “horseplay, shouting, racing and other youthful actions” that reportedly led to a Michigan mall’s parental-supervision policy.

A fair policy would attempt to limit or punish unacceptable behavior, whomever the perpetrator; curfews and unaccompanied-minor bans instead punish all teens. “When some teens act badly, there’s some kind of permission among policy makers and business leaders to therefore ban all teens,” John Wall, a co-director of Rutgers University’s Childism Institute, which researches methods for empowering children, told me. These measures restrict kids from moving and assembling freely, and they are, in Wall’s view, discriminatory. Some limitations on children can be beneficial; compulsory schooling, for example, guarantees young people the right to an education, and age requirements for driver’s licenses are in place because younger children cannot operate cars safely. But “existing in public and engaging with businesses do not require any such special capacities,” Wall said. “The reason for children being excluded is simply because of their childhood, not for any compelling state interest.” Children, of course, do not have the same legal rights as adults, and businesses have a lot of latitude to deny service to customers. This is why restricting anyone under 18 on the offhand chance that they could be rowdy is possible. But that doesn’t make it just.

Coming of age requires learning independence, figuring out who you are and how you relate to the world. This is hard to do if you’re forbidden from even buying a chicken sandwich without a grown-up looking over your shoulder. Good decision making, some studies suggest, is less about cognitive development and more about getting experience exploring one’s environment. That’s how young people learn—if they are allowed to explore in the first place.

Wall said that he sees the recent business bans and curfews as part of a longer historical trend of “children’s gradual disappearance from the public realm.” For Mintz’s part, he recalled his own childhood in the 1960s and the freedom he had to wander alone or with his peers. That freedom has slowly faded over the decades as the cultural standard of parenting has shifted toward more supervision and as more adolescents spend their time shuttling to and from home, school, and chaperoned activities. Kids on their own in public have come to seem like a problem to be solved. “Historically, adolescence was often tolerated—sometimes grudgingly—as a noisy, inconvenient presence in public life,” Mintz said. “What feels new is how little room there is now for young people to simply be in shared spaces without adult oversight.”

The boomlet of restrictions on minors is coming at the same time as a wave of concern about adolescent isolation. A recent World Health Organization report found that loneliness rates are higher among teens than among other age groups. More than 40 percent of teenagers say that they do not consistently get the social support they need, according to a 2024 CDC report. How much time teens spend on their phone and the risks that poses to their mental health has been a topic of much discussion. The more that teens roam their community, a 2022 psychology study suggests, the happier and more socially connected they are—yet curfews and business bans make it harder for young people to hang out off-screen. It’s little wonder that many teens are at home on their phone if they get the message that they are not welcome in public. “What kind of society does this?” Mintz asked.

The kind of society that does this is one in which too many people see the raising of the next generation not as a communal responsibility but as something for parents to handle at home, out of sight. It’s one that deludes itself that youth might wake up on the morning of their 18th birthday endowed with all of the social skills they need to be considerate members of society, without having practiced along the way. It’s one that tells teens, over and over, that they are not neighbors, but nuisances.</div>

            <h2>The Four Types of Trump Supporter</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/trump-roles-supporters-categories/685706/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first year of Donald Trump’s second term has made two things clear. First, the MAGA coalition is not breaking up any time soon. Even after the especially chaotic events of the past few weeks, Trump supporters are sticking by their man. Second, faith in Trump’s leadership is not driven by his adherence to a coherent political ideology. Trump, who, as part of his “America First” policy, once declared that he would be “getting out of the nation-building business,” has now declared that the U.S. “will run the country” of Venezuela for the foreseeable future. An administration that promised to look out for the “working man” has handed billions of tax dollars back to America’s wealthiest households while stripping health care from the most vulnerable.

If ideological consistency can’t explain the enduring loyalty of Trump’s base, what does? A new study by More in Common, the nonprofit research organization where we work, finds that Trump’s coalition is not monolithic. It consists of four groups, each with a distinct profile and perspective. Trump’s political power depends on his ability to connect with these groups on different emotional and psychological grounds.

Over the course of 10 months, we surveyed more than 10,000 people who said they voted for Trump in 2024, and conducted extensive focus groups, conversations, and in-depth interviews. We then identified groups of Trump voters with similar attitudes and beliefs.

About 29 percent of 2024 Trump voters are what we call the “MAGA Hardliners.” These are the fiery core of Trump’s base, mostly composed of white Gen Xers and Baby Boomers, who are animated by the belief that God is on their side in America’s existential struggle between good and evil. Then there are the “Anti-Woke Conservatives” (21 percent): a more secular and affluent group of voters deeply frustrated by what they perceive as the takeover of schools, culture, and institutions by the progressive left. Another 30 percent are the “Mainline Republicans”: a more racially diverse group of middle-of-the-road conservatives who prioritize border security, a strong economy, and cultural stability. Finally, we have the “Reluctant Right” (20 percent). Members of this group, unlike the other three, are not necessarily part of Trump’s base; they voted for him, but have ambivalent feelings toward him. Only half identify as Republicans, and many picked Trump because he seemed “less bad” than the alternative.

Yair Rosenberg: The biggest myth about Trump’s base (and why many believe it)

Our research suggests that Trump’s ability to play different roles for his coalition yields an emotional payoff that exceeds the value of philosophical or logical consistency.

The first role that Trump plays, which resonates for all four groups, is that of a “builder.” Trump’s social-media rants and diatribes against “corrupt” institutions create a common misperception that his appeal centers on tearing things down. In fact, his voters see him primarily as a constructive force. When asked to choose from a set of roles that they associate with Trump, 58 percent of survey participants selected “a builder trying to fix a broken system”—the highest share of any option offered. For the Reluctant Right, this sense of construction is paired with an image of managerial competence: They are more likely than any of the other groups to describe Trump as a “businessman” or a “CEO running a company.” The perception of Trump’s positive, constructive role helps explain why “hope” is the emotion that Trump supporters most commonly associate with his presidency.

Trump’s second role is that of “redeemer”: someone who can restore his supporters’ status and respect in a society that they feel has long looked down on them. Most Trump voters in our study believe that America’s cultural institutions have been dominated by those who scorn their values and way of life. Seventy-six percent agree with the statement “The woke left has ruined American education, news, and entertainment.” Accompanying this diagnosis is a sense of disrespect from political elites and Democrats. Only a quarter of Trump voters feel respected by Americans who voted for Democrats, whereas 84 percent believe that “President Trump respects people like me.” (The important exception to this is the Reluctant Right, who feel respected by neither Trump nor Democrats.)

The third role is that of an energizing “blasphemer”—a violator of progressive norms. This identity resonates most strongly with MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives, who believe that the political left has become a sanctimonious elite imposing its worldview on everyone else. About 90 percent of MAGA Hardliners and Anti-Woke Conservatives agree that the “left actually hates America.” This generates a desire not just for redemption but also for retribution. Trump presents himself as a norm-breaker who delights in poking his finger in his critics’ eyes: More than three-quarters of MAGA Hardliners and more than half of Anti-Woke Conservatives believe that “President Trump should make the left pay for its mistakes and lies.” This sense of transgression fuels a gleeful energy that runs through much of Trump’s public communication. As Gina, a 50-year-old white woman who lives in Florida, told us, Trump is “a gigantic orange flashing middle finger, and I love it.”

The final role—one that appeals especially to MAGA Hardliners—is what we call the “grand narrator.” Trump’s appeal can be understood only in the context of a decades-long collapse of trust in American institutions including Congress, the press, academia, and the scientific establishment. MAGA Hardliners—and, to a lesser extent, Anti-Woke Conservatives—overwhelmingly view the media as dishonest and believe that the “deep state” is setting the course for the whole nation. Even with unified Republican control of the White House, Supreme Court, and Congress, a majority of both groups still distrusts the federal government. In this uncertain epistemic landscape, Trump has emerged not just as a decisive leader but as a central purveyor of truth: 93 percent of MAGA Hardliners and 72 percent of Anti-Woke Conservatives say they trust him more than “all” or “most other sources.” In other words, Trump has positioned himself as both the narrator and the hero of his own story.

David Brooks: Why do so many people think Trump is good?

Politicians typically try to appeal to voters by aligning their policies with voters’ preferences. Trump satisfies deeper needs. For those despairing about our country’s direction, he offers hope; for those who feel disrespected, validation; for those who feel doubtful, clarity.

Trump’s political skills were forged in WWE arenas, on reality-TV sets, and in the luxury real-estate business—industries that live and die by their ability to capture attention, simplify narratives, and deliver emotional impact. These experiences taught him how to establish emotional bonds with audiences that far outweigh any connection based on shared ideology.

Trump’s detractors may dismiss these bonds as empty or irrelevant. But for the people who experience them, they are very real. The relationship Trump has established with tens of millions of Americans offers them something they cannot attain through conventional politics. In his various roles, he embodies the reality that they want. This is the source of his power.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the Information Revolution accelerates around the world, upending everything from the international balance of power to the future of work, American culture and American politics are undergoing perhaps their most profound upheaval in the 250 years since the 13 colonies declared their independence. It could hardly be otherwise.

The greatest wave of immigration in American history, with over 70 million immigrants arriving in the U.S. since 1965, is refashioning the demography and culture of neighborhoods all over the country. The rise of social media has disrupted both the media system and political parties. Financial markets gyrate, industries rise and fall at blistering rates, and new life-changing technologies appear faster than we can adjust to them. Legal challenges to constitutional doctrines underpinning the modern American administrative state wend their way through increasingly sympathetic courts, promising sweeping changes to the ways our most important institutions act. The financial underpinnings of government programs look disturbingly shaky, with roughly 40 percent of Americans telling pollsters that they think neither Medicare nor Social Security will last another 10 years. Meanwhile the ominous rise of adversarial great powers, continued worries over terrorism and cyberattacks, and the general sense that the foundations of the post-Cold War peace are rapidly crumbling cast lengthening shadows over the American mind.

The dizzying rise of Donald Trump is more consequence than cause of the wider upheaval. But he is more than a flash of lightning in a stormy sky. The political coalition that has formed under his banner has the potential to reshape American politics. A large chunk of Silicon Valley has jumped onto the Trump bandwagon, and this alliance between the cutting edge of American capitalist enterprise and the beating heart of American populism is, potentially, a major development. Long after Trump himself has exited the scene, the fate of the coalition he has helped forge will be a principal driver of American and world history.

This is all recent. During the 2016 campaign, Peter Thiel stood out among tech leaders by openly endorsing Trump. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen proclaimed that Hillary Clinton was the “obvious choice” for president. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once unabashedly decried Trump as “unfit to be President” and “a threat to national security.”

Trump openly feuded with Elon Musk both during and after his first term and frequently sparred with Jeff Bezos, referring to the Amazon founder as “Jeff Bozo.” Angry about Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s alleged role in the 2020 election, Trump threatened him with life in prison “if he does anything illegal this time.”.

That has changed. Trump’s second inauguration featured tech lords like Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook laughing and shaking hands with the Trump inner circle inside the Capitol Rotunda. “In the first term, everybody was fighting me,” Trump joked in late 2024. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.” With figures like Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, Palantir’s Alex Karp and Joe Lonsdale, Marc Andreessen, David Marcus, and Mark Pincus jumping aboard the Trump train, Silicon Valley has shifted from a bastion of anti-Trumpers to one of the polarizing president’s chief sources of support.

Not everybody in MAGA world is happy about this shift. “I’m a populist,” Steve Bannon proclaimed defiantly on his influential podcast, War Room. “I’m not gonna kowtow to Zuckerberg. He’s a criminal. Bezos? He’s a weirdo. Musk? No. Not gonna do it. Google? … YouTube banned [us] forever.” Bannon believes that the whole purpose of the MAGA movement is to punish and crush the ruling elite—Wall Street financiers, Washington’s bipartisan donor class, and the Silicon Valley tech billionaires—responsible in his view for turning ordinary working-class Americans into the equivalent of indentured servants and serfs. For Bannon, driving the Muskian moneychangers from the temple of Trump is a sacred task.

The feelings are reciprocated. Elon Musk greeted the December 2025 release of photographs of Steve Bannon with Jeffrey Epstein with a tweet. “Only a matter of time before Bannon goes back to prison,” Musk posted on his social-media platform.

But Donald Trump wants to keep the peace in this fractious coalition, and he seems rather fond of the moneychangers. He is hardly alone. In March, Vice President J. D. Vance addressed the American Dynamism Summit, sponsored by the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Identifying himself as “a proud member” of both the techno-optimists and the populist right in the Trump coalition, Vance argued that the alliance is anything but shallow or temporary. “This idea,” Vance asserted, “that tech-forward people and the populists are somehow inevitably going to come to a loggerheads is wrong.”

Many observers see the love affair as purely transactional. Contributing to Trump’s inauguration was a way for tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta—as well as prominent Silicon Valley executives ranging from Altman to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi—to get help with Justice Department lawsuits and Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigations.

The same holds true of figures who joined the administration. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is one of the largest recipients of U.S.-government funding, and as of February 2025, Musk&#39;s various companies had pulled in at least $38 billion from government contracts, subsidies, loans, and tax credits. David Sacks, the White House crypto and AI czar, reportedly sold his personal cryptocurrency investments before joining the administration, but the venture-capital firm where he remains a partner continues to invest heavily in crypto-related companies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s former firm, Cantor Fitzgerald (now run by his sons), maintains close ties with Tether, the fintech/cryptocurrency company currently under investigation by both the Treasury and Justice Departments for possible violations of finance laws.

Dismissing such conflicts as a grotesque but meaningless assemblage of scandals—the love child of Teapot Dome and Watergate—would be a mistake. We aren’t just witnessing a few episodes of distressing insider dealing and corruption. We are watching the old system dying as disturbing but also dynamic new realities emerge. The restraining forces of custom and law are struggling to withstand the passions and power of a whole generation of business and political leaders. The Gilded Age saw an eruption of scandal and corruption that accompanied and even enabled the transformation of the American economy alongside explosive changes in technology. Donald Trump’s Washington looks like the Gilded Age on steroids.

Since its founding, the United States has been more open than any other large country to the intense activity, sometimes competitive and sometimes cooperative, of two of the most powerful forces in the modern world. One of them is the restless, rowdy, often crude and chaotic but ultimately irresistible force that Alexis de Tocqueville called democracy. The other is capitalism, the greatest engine for revolutionary social transformation the world has ever seen.

Democracy is a tiger, not a pussycat. The orderly, progressive, and highly institutionalized blending of electoral politics with stable administrative states that dominated Western European and American politics for the past half century shares little with this rude and revolutionary force. Democracy emerges from the unappeasable and ultimately ungovernable demand of ordinary people to run their own lives and institutions without the oversight of kings, nobles, colonialists, or even highly educated and credentialed professionals from elite universities who base their policy prescriptions on the latest peer-reviewed scholarship.

The advance of democracy—sometimes classified as a left-wing force (anti-colonial movements, feminist demands for women’s freedom to shape their lives without the control of male hierarchies, workers’ movements in industrial societies, demands by Indigenous peoples and ethnic and racial minorities for the right to shape their own destinies in their own ways), sometimes coded right-wing (contemporary European populism, MAGA, nativism, majoritarian identity politics)—is as unstoppable as it is problematic. American society has historically been more open to this force and given it an earlier, fuller expression than most other large societies around the world.

Capitalism is the other force that restlessly and continually remakes the world. It has the ability to drive scientific discovery and technological progress, to overcome or displace its opponents, and to dictate the terms of both internal and global hierarchies of power and wealth. Those who master its dynamics, adapt to its demands, and unlock its resources gain power within their societies. The societies that can advance to the frontiers of the productive power that capitalism unleashes while maintaining their coherence and élan advance to the front of the race for international status and power.

The remarkable thing about American history is less that populism and capitalism sometimes clash than the extent to which they have managed to work together. America’s ability to maintain popular support for disruptive economic and technological change—changes that ultimately made the country richer and stronger—was critical to the country’s long-term political stability. It was also the indispensable foundation of America’s rise to, and long reign at, the top of the global pecking order.

The distinctive task of statecraft in the modern world is to give capitalism the freedom to develop and intensify, while simultaneously satisfying the democratic aspirations of ordinary people. In practice, this means that the productivity enhancements and wealth capitalism produces must somehow be harnessed to give people more agency in their own lives, and to preserve the fabric of meaning that unites a given population in a sense of community and common destiny.

John Kaag: A reality check for tech oligarchs

A productive synthesis between the political requirements of an increasingly populist society and the sometimes-harsh logic of ever-accelerating capitalist development is a relatively rare and precious thing. In America, the interplay—sometimes competitive and sometimes cooperative—between the pro-corporate and business-friendly tradition of American politics that descends from Alexander Hamilton and the populist streak associated with Andrew Jackson has defined the course of the ongoing accommodation between these titanic forces. Hamiltonians have long believed that America’s international security, economic prosperity, and domestic stability depend on a constructive relationship between an enterprise-friendly state and a dynamic private sector. Hamiltonians are accelerationists, seeing capitalism as the source of the wealth and technological prowess that underwrite American comity at home and power abroad.

Jacksonian populists believe that the sources of America’s national greatness lie in the political and cultural instincts of ordinary Americans, and that the chief purpose of national policy, both at home and abroad, should be to protect the people from foreign threats while promoting their prosperity and safeguarding their freedom. Many of the changes that capitalism brings, including the destruction of old industries and the rise of mass migration, are profoundly unwelcome to the Jacksonian spirit. However, unlike populists in many other countries, who view both business enterprise and technological change with inveterate suspicion, American Jacksonians see both enterprise and technological leadership as key elements of the cultural patrimony they seek to defend.

To the extent one can speak meaningfully of American exceptionalism as a historical phenomenon rather than an idealistic aspiration or mythologization of historical experience, its roots lie here. The sense of progress and change embedded in the heart of the American populist tradition makes productive compromise between the demands of democracy and the requirements of capitalism easier for Americans to achieve than for the citizens of many other countries.

Andrew Jackson’s campaign against the Second Bank of the United States, for example, expressed a populist resentment of eastern banking on the part of western and southern states. But what they resented was not that Nicholas Biddle’s bank was capitalistic. It was that the financial structure the bank upheld placed obstacles in the path of the rapid economic development of the cash-hungry frontier. In the language of our time, they wanted to deregulate finance. While the Jacksonian program helped produce a massive depression, the Jacksonians’ intention was to accelerate capitalism by democratizing it, not to tame it by subjecting it to government planning.

Since the 1850s, the health of the Republican Party has largely depended on its ability to build bridges between the agendas of wealthy investors, entrepreneurs, and Big Business on the one hand, and often-angry, disaffected populists on the other. The Republican Congress passed the Homestead Act during the Civil War, giving essentially free public land to farmers, even as it supported the railroads, mining companies, banks, and industrial corporations that made the United States the world’s richest and most powerful state.

Presidents of both parties have pursued this formula. In very different ways, both the Republican Theodore and his distant Democratic cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt forged coalitions including populists and business interests to reshape American institutions in their time.

Donald Trump and his odd-couple coalition of tech moguls and insurgent populists need to be seen against this history. Today Elon Musk and his fellow tech lords advocate what they believe to be the necessary policies to make the United States powerful abroad and rich at home. Steve Bannon and his populist allies represent modern-day Jacksonian discontent as they fight what they see as the illegitimate economic and social privilege of the mostly coastal, well-connected elites.

Forging this fractious coalition was key to Trump’s return to power, and the fate of his second term likely depends on his ability to keep it together. He may well fail. Inflation and unemployment might break his hold on the public mind. The tensions within the coalition might explode, or its agenda might be so radically conceived or so chaotically executed that the public rejects it. The movement could be broken apart by infighting over the succession, international allies might revolt, and domestic adversaries might find more appealing methods of responding to the crisis. The stench of corruption might become so overwhelming that a revolted electorate rejects the entire enterprise.

But whatever the fate of the Trump administration, from Brooklyn to Boise, both the left and the right are testing the boundaries of the civil consensus. The accelerating Information Revolution is reshaping the American corporate landscape, opening new horizons for scientific discovery, threatening millions of jobs, and raising questions about the future of humanity in an age of intelligent machines. Long after Trump passes to his final judgment, the turbulence that brought him to power will be the defining feature of our time.

Donald Trump’s jettisoning of long-established Republican orthodoxies on trade and the role of the state stand among his most startling accomplishments. The liberalization of trade policy and the deregulation of the national economy were central to Republican policy from Ronald Reagan through Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign. No longer.

Although Trump’s reversal of that long-standing orientation alienated some business leaders, he received more business support in 2024 than he did in 2016. This should not come as a shock. Eras of massive technologically driven change often bring struggles within the business world over economic policy.

The historical figure who did most to develop an American tradition of pro-business government and to embed that tradition in the structure of the American state was Alexander Hamilton. First the Federalists, then the Whigs, and finally the Republicans championed his ideas. The Federalists and Whigs tended to support tariffs, partly for protectionist reasons and partly to generate revenue to build domestic infrastructure. Republicans continued that high-tariff tradition into the 1930s. The Hamiltonian tradition of the Republican Party also included more support for Big Government than the party of Reagan was comfortable admitting.

Hamilton, throughout his tragically shortened career, was preoccupied by the relationship between democracy, power, and wealth. Given the rowdy disposition of the American people, he saw no way to build a stable American state that did not accommodate the demand for popular self-government. Yet, as was obvious to anyone who had studied its history, democratic governance has its pitfalls. Demagogues could prey on the emotions and ignorance of the masses. Rampant corruption was never far away.

The Founders relied on a system of checks and balances to address these dangers. But Hamilton was focused on another threat—and another sort of solution. He put capitalism and technological development front and center in his thinking about the future of the American republic. He believed that capitalist development was essential for national power and unity. Prosperity at home would strengthen and legitimize the federal government, while America’s economic prowess would provide the basis for the military strength that could keep the country secure.

Change is the natural and inevitable result of the Hamiltonians’ success. The capitalism they promote transforms the economy, and they must repeatedly redefine their agenda to meet the new conditions. Hamiltonians supported the construction of the Erie and Chesapeake & Ohio Canals in the early years of the republic, then shifted to railroads, and ultimately to interstate highways and airports. Each of these technologies required novel institutions, legal frameworks, and financial incentives. Managing their consequences required, among other things, the development of the administrative state that so many conservatives currently deplore.

This incessant and, over time, accelerating change in the nature of the economy is what drives continuous changes in the definition of pro-business policy in the United States. What was good for the railroads was not good for the canals, and what was good for slavery-based cotton production was not good for the industrializing free-labor system. The highly regulated post–World War II economy of the 1950s and 1960s was good for monopolies like AT&T, but emerging telecommunications and IT companies needed deregulation to reach their potential in the 1970s and 1980s.

The same was true of trade policy. After World War II, the Hamiltonian calculation on tariffs changed. Federal income tax provided a much larger financial base for projects like Dwight Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System than tariffs could. At the same time, well-capitalized, professionally managed, and technologically sophisticated American companies dominated the world. And as Western Europe and Japan recovered from the war, American firms were more interested in gaining access to these growing markets than in preventing their exporters from competing in the American market. The importance of economic integration in building a robust Cold War coalition to check the spread of Soviet power was also an important part of the calculation.

With the end of the Cold War, a generation of Hamiltonian policy makers placed an even greater priority on free trade. Enabled by revolutionary advances in communications, computers, and shipping, multinational firms dramatically reduced their costs and enlarged their markets by developing global supply and distribution chains. American firms embraced the idea of a seamless global economy in which information, goods, and capital could move around the world with little friction.

Today, as the Information Revolution transforms American society, a new kind of pro-business agenda is once again emerging. Silicon Valley leaders are not only warming to Trump, they are also proposing a new vision of the national interest. These Tech Hamiltonians share their predecessors’ belief that economic policy, political stability, and national security are deeply connected, but they propose to pursue these traditional Hamiltonian goals in radically new ways.

As the definition of pro-business politics changes, the relationship of that agenda to populist politics also must change. The tech lords who have rallied to Trump see enough overlap between MAGA populism and their emergent Tech Hamiltonian agenda on key economic and culture-war issues to build, they hope, an enduring coalition.

In the post–Cold War era, multinational corporations and their associated intellectuals and politicians defined the Hamiltonian agenda, pursuing the free-trade, free-market, low-tax, and light-touch regulation approach often called “neoliberalism.” They saw American leadership as most securely grounded in a deep web of alliances and multilateral institutions, and were primarily focused on the transatlantic relationship with America’s allies in Europe. In domestic politics, the neoliberal Hamiltonians found their most reliable political partners among order-building Wilsonian idealists, and for 25 years this coalition attempted to build what they called a liberal or rules-based world order that championed human rights, a cosmopolitan post-nationalist elite culture, and a frictionless global environment for the movement of goods and capital.

Although today’s Tech Hamiltonians continue to endorse some elements of this agenda, notably the preference for low taxes and light-touch regulation, they reject much of the approach. They are nationalist, rather than cosmopolitan. They do not see the European Union as America’s preferred partner abroad, and are focused on geopolitical and economic competition with China. At home, they see Jacksonian populists rather than Wilsonian idealists as their most important allies. And while the manufacturing, retailing, and banking executives who led the top American firms in the post–Cold War era saw themselves as scientific managers, the Tech Hamiltonians—often the extremely successful founders of cutting-edge technology firms—see themselves as visionaries and leaders. They are unaccustomed to deferring to professors, think-tankers, and authors of thumb-sucking essays on public policy.

While there are differences among the leaders of the Tech Hamiltonian world, what led so many to the Trump movement is a shared vision of the challenges facing the United States. They believe that the Information Revolution, greatly enhanced by the rise of AI, will disrupt American life and American politics on a massive scale. They see the United States and China at the forefront of this revolution, racing both to develop technologies and to apply their productive power. And they think that the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to direct immense resources toward chosen areas of endeavor and to impose massive changes on its society gives it advantages that the United States will be hard pressed to overcome.

America’s most important problems, as the Tech Hamiltonians see it, are political. At least in the short term, tech-driven automation is going to reduce both blue-collar jobs and white-collar employment in government bureaucracies and private corporations. At the same time, social media will continue to undercut political parties and ideologies. As the disruption increases, political support for suffocating regulations is likely to grow.

The Tech Hamiltonians see Europe as a cautionary tale. In 2024, European regulators, driven in part by voters anxious about online disinformation and polarization inflamed by social media, passed the world’s most comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence and digital technologies. At the time, the tech industry warned that this new regulation would drive companies overseas, accelerating the mass withdrawal of capital from an already moribund tech sector and start-up ecosystem.

The economic and geopolitical consequences of European technophobia, among both elites and the general public, have been grave. Between 1990 and 2023, the EU’s share of global GDP fell from 23.8 percent to 14.6 percent. India’s GDP is on pace to be larger than that of the entire EU within the next 12 years. On January 16, 2026 of the 50 largest publicly traded tech companies in the world by market capitalization, 33 were American and only four European. Moreover, out of the 65 unicorns around the world with a valuation of at least $10 billion, only five came from countries in the EU, while 44 were American and 10 were Chinese.

Derek Thompson: How the British broke their own economy

The central political task for those who see the rapid development of tech capabilities as critical for the future of the United States (and for their own personal wealth and well-being) is to cultivate a permissive environment for the tech revolution even as its disruptive consequences become more widely and more painfully felt. A large number of tech moguls have come to feel that the Democratic Party is essentially useless for this purpose. Whatever sympathies they may have with some of its values, Tech Hamiltonians see the Democratic Party as tied to constituencies—big-city political machines, bureaucrats of all stripes, stand-pat academics, public-sector labor unions, and the NGO-industrial complex—that depend on the old system and will fight the very changes America most needs.

But the old-style, neoliberal Hamiltonian agenda of the classic Republican Party establishment will also never do. The fundamental appreciation of capitalism, techno-optimism, and American power at the heart of the old Republican agenda are valuable and important, but the anti-populist and neoliberal ideology of the Never Trumpers makes them, as Tech Hamiltonians see it, politically irrelevant. Never Trump Republicans simply do not have the political weight to carry forward a transformational agenda. Worse, perhaps, leadership in moments of upheaval requires a certain theatricality and improvisational creativity that establishment Republican politicians tend to lack.

What Tech Hamiltonians see that the old-school Hamiltonians do not is the potential for a coalition with MAGA populism, and a way to work effectively with Donald Trump. MAGA rage against the entitled class of upper-middle-class experts can provide political support for the disruption and wholesale destruction that Tech Hamiltonians believe many bureaucracies need, and for the revolutionary changes in health care and education they think the new technologies will both facilitate and require. And while labor-market disruption is also coming for blue-collar workers, Tech Hamiltonians are comfortable with strategies for addressing blue-collar discontent that old-school Republicans could never accept.

Free trade is the most obvious point of difference. From a theoretical point of view, the advantages of free trade are as great as ever, but as a practical matter, since tech companies do not import or export many industrial goods or raw materials, free trade in goods matters much less to companies like Meta than to those like Walmart or GM. And even tech lords who concede the intellectual case for free trade now view some degree of protectionism as inevitable to safeguard essential supply lines and preserve certain manufacturing capabilities in the United States.

Similarly, immigration is a hill that conventional pro-business Republicans are ready to die on and from which Tech Hamiltonians are ready to retreat. If you believe, as most students of the tech revolution do, that in the short run tech is going to disrupt the jobs of blue-collar workers, you are unlikely to believe that large-scale low-skill immigration is a vital economic necessity. And while the tech lords would like as many H-1B visas for skilled tech workers as they can possibly obtain, they are weighing that objective against the importance of keeping their political coalition reasonably united. Construction companies, fast-food franchisees, retailers, and others whose businesses depend on an abundant supply of low-wage workers might fight for mass immigration. Tech Hamiltonians see things differently, and are open to reducing immigration if that could alleviate blue-collar discontent.

Strong private-sector labor unions also do not pose the same problems for tech companies with small, professional, and well-compensated workforces that they do for large manufacturing and retailing companies. And if the combination of protectionism and immigration restriction results in labor shortages that drive wages higher, tech firms will likely benefit. As wages rise, companies will spend more money to automate. That will build the domestic American market for everything that the tech world produces. A populist economic agenda that looks like an attack on everything sacred to the earlier generation of establishment Republicans simply does not strike the tech world as antibusiness.

On cultural issues as well, the cowboys of the tech revolution find it easy to accommodate MAGA preferences and priorities. Despite the liberal views of more than a few employees, many Silicon Valley companies are eager to shed their DEI bureaucracies and retreat from the pronoun wars. Patriotism is a value that an IP-dependent tech company fighting Chinese rivals might well be happy to see inculcated in its employees. Many tech executives grew weary of what they saw as insubordination by woke employees opposed to collaboration with the Defense Department or other arms of the American government.

The Tech Hamiltonians may see the greatest opportunity for collaboration with the MAGA populists at the intersection of culture and class. AI and related technologies promise to drastically downsize bureaucracies of all kinds, disrupt high-cost economic sectors like higher education, and restructure the delivery of high-value services like health care. Those who profit from the status quo and whose identities and interests are grounded in the high salaries and high-status jobs it currently provides are sure to mount a skilled, determined, and prolonged resistance. That opposition is perhaps the principal obstacle in the path of both the economic goals of the tech industry and the national strategy they believe is necessary. Overcoming that resistance is also very much in the economic and social interest of the tens of millions of Americans who rely on the high-cost services that lawyers, bureaucrats, professors, doctors, and other highly trained, well-compensated professionals currently provide.

The DOGE attack on the federal bureaucracy early in Trump’s second term provided an early glimpse into this future of rapid overhaul and radical downsizing of established, entrenched public bureaucracies. The more substantive assault on independent agencies currently winding through the courts underscores the importance for the Trump movement of the attack on bureaucracy. It is tempting to look at the errors, confusions, casual cruelties, and missteps of the teenage DOGE operatives—reforming agencies whose history, function, and legal position they do not always understand—and dismiss the entire project.

That would be a serious mistake. It is more than ideological opposition to some bureaucratic decisions or regulations that drives the Tech Hamiltonian assault on the administrative state. From a technology point of view, a bureaucracy is a primitive form of AI, with well-paid human professionals applying algorithms—that is, laws and regulations—to facts. There is no reason, as many tech enthusiasts see it, why most of the work now done by these bureaucratic organizations could not be done by AI. And the AI versions of bureaucracy will likely be cheaper, faster, and easier to reprogram when circumstances change than their human counterparts.

Compared to the blue-collar workers displaced in earlier waves of modernization, the highly educated members of the bureaucratic class have a much greater ability to make their pain heard and felt in the political system. In a MAGA movement that mobilizes blue-collar Americans around the cross-racial class resentment of elites to drive big changes through the service professions, the Tech Hamiltonians have, they hope, found an invaluable ally.

No political ideology, no matter how coherent, and no political coalition, however robust, ever achieves total victory in American politics. The Tech Hamiltonians, who bring an ambitious program with a fragile coalition to a tumultuous era, will be no exception to this rule.

In the short term, their alliance with Donald Trump can go sour. Trump’s popularity may wane and his friends and allies be tarred by their association with a figure most of the country would rather forget. Alternatively, Trump’s pursuit of his political interests could lead him to break with the Tech Hamiltonians as enthusiastically as he once embraced them. In the Trump Age, no alignments are stable.

But over the long run, the relationship of Tech Hamiltonianism to the ideas and interests of the larger business community, the degree of competence and coherence they can bring to the implementation of their agenda, and their ability to forge deep and constructive links with MAGA populists will matter more than their relationship to our current president.

The Tech Hamiltonians are the voice of only one part—although perhaps the most dynamic and most rapidly growing part—of the American business community. But in the foreseeable future, the American business community will not speak with one voice. The legacy multinationals will still be among us. Construction and hospitality firms dependent on cheap labor will still have a voice. Should the AI frenzy on Wall Street turn out to be a bubble that pops, should AI fail to live up to the sweeping claims made in its name, the pendulum of power in the business world could rapidly shift.

The tech world’s rise to its current economic dominance has been dizzyingly fast. As recently as 2005, only eight of the top 100 firms on the Fortune 500 list were info-tech companies, and as recently as 2013, ExxonMobil remained the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Today, tech stocks are a key driving force within the S&P 500, while boasting nine out of the top 10 most valuable companies by market capitalization. The so-called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia—now represent roughly 35 percent of the S&P 500, a stunning increase from their roughly 12 percent share in 2015. In 2008, when Mark Zuckerberg made his first splash on the Forbes richest-persons list, he was one of the few U.S. billionaires who had made his fortune primarily in tech. In 2025, nine out of the top 10 richest business tycoons in the country derived their wealth, which totals more than $2.2 trillion, from tech companies.

Even so, roughly 65 percent of the value of the S&P 500 remains in non-tech companies. Amazon might be one of the Magnificent Seven, but its business model requires cheap imports and, until it can fully automate its distribution network, cheap immigrant labor. Plenty of companies, including some of the most important Wall Street banks, think competition with China is a cost to contain rather than a cause to embrace. Tech Hamiltonians might dominate the tech sector, but much of the Republican establishment and the American business world remains attached to the older model of Hamiltonian policy. The ability of the Tech Hamiltonians to define what pro-business policy looks like is tied to the degree to which the tech industry continues to displace older firms and industries.

And then there is the pesky problem of execution. Celebrating AI’s potential to make bureaucracies smaller, cheaper, and more effective is easy, but realizing that potential is a task that requires a lot of skull sweat. AI might bring advances to medicine, or make the law cheaper, but making any of these things happen on a large scale is hard, as Elon Musk’s not-always-artful DOGErs discovered early in the Trump administration. Those who might be displaced or de-skilled by the advancing tech wave will fight in the office with passive aggression, in the media with poisonous leaks delivered at just the worst time, and in legislatures through the voting power of the bureaucrats, teachers’ unions, and other interest groups.

Beyond that, the tech lords often suffer the vices of their virtues. Having built multibillion-dollar companies, often at a young age, their self-confidence frequently leads them to underestimate the complexities of public policy, to misunderstand public opinion, and to overestimate their ability to push large changes through quickly. For the tech revolution to reach its potential, the forces of reform and renewal will need managers who understand the inner workings of industries like America’s insanely complex system of health care. Every Cortés needs a Malinche.

All too often, the implementation of the tech revolution in a given enterprise or bureau depends either on outsiders who don’t know how things work and break more than they constructively change or on captives of old ways of thinking and old professional and intellectual networks with blinkered ideas about change. In the private sector, the driving need to earn a profit often tips the scale in favor of change. In government, different voices tend to prevail.

Tech Hamiltonians and Silicon Valley enthusiasts are often inexperienced in the ways of government and unaccustomed to the compromise and diplomacy that successful policy implementation often requires. And the old hands who know their way around the Washington labyrinth mostly see the Tech Hamiltonians as a menace to be thwarted, and so use their talent and knowledge to work against rather than for the new regime.

Ali Breland: So much for the MAGA divorce

The Tech Hamiltonians must also find some means of maintaining their strained coalition with the growing universe of disaffected voters, both on the right and on the left, who identify with some form of populism. Few Jacksonian populists expected or welcomed the participation of people like Elon Musk in what they thought of as their movement. When Trump gratified his Tech Hamiltonian supporters with his December 2025 executive order banning state AI regulations, much of MAGA was horrified. The gaps in worldview and economic and political interest between blue-collar Americans and uber-rich tech lords are real and consequential. Their economic interests may further diverge as tech-driven restructuring throws millions of working-class Americans out of work.

Flag waving, immigration restriction, and culture-war rallying cries can shore up the MAGA-tech coalition, but more will be needed to achieve lasting success. In the 19th century, the Homestead Act offered free public land to any American citizen who lived on a claim for five years, cementing the loyalty of millions of voters to a Republican Party that was simultaneously gifting public resources to railroads and mining companies. In the 20th century, the 30-year mortgage and highway construction combined to make suburbia possible, creating strong bonds between middle-class Americans and the political and business establishments. Tech Hamiltonians will have to find their own way to link the economic and social well-being of ordinary American families to the new economy they seek to create.

Even Americans unsympathetic to this emerging coalition need to recognize that we are dealing with something deeper and more lasting than the eccentricities of a particularly gifted politician and the greed of a few companies. The success of this new coalition is by no means guaranteed. But whether it fails or whether it succeeds, the results of this latest attempt to build an alliance between the heirs of Andrew Jackson and Alexander Hamilton could define American politics for a generation to come.</div>

            <h2>Winter Ice Could Humble the United States</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/ice-winter-storm-danger/685737/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Open up the government’s national weather-alert map, and pretty much the entire eastern half of the country is painted one color or another. A thick pink band stretches from New Mexico, across Texas, then through Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont—a winter-storm warning. To the north, a dark-blue splotch around the Great Lakes—extreme-cold warning. And then a narrower, deep-purple band through the Southeast, from East Texas up through the Carolinas—ice-storm warning.

By Sunday, when the storm peaks, more than half of the people in the lower 48 will be experiencing some combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. Sixteen states and Washington, D.C., have declared states of emergency. Colder-than-usual air from Canada will drift across the eastern United States and meet up with an atmospheric river from the Pacific. The U.S. “didn’t have any hurricanes last year, but this is definitely the equivalent of a hurricane, from Texas to the Northeast,” in terms of its potential for power outages and wind damage, Ryan Maue, a meteorologist and the former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. Those in the band with an ice-storm warning, he said, should think of “preparing for a hurricane—except it’s ice.” Many of these regions aren’t used to getting this kind of winter weather. And as one man in North Carolina posted on X, “Ice will humble you fast.”

“Two or three inches of snow, we can handle that,” Maribel Martinez-Mejia, the director of emergency preparedness for the North Central Texas Council of Governments, told me. But, she said, more than a quarter inch of ice is a challenge; her region could see about half an inch or more. That amount can add as much as 500 pounds of weight to a power line and cause an outage. “The power grid is vulnerable to ice,” Jason Shafer, a meteorologist and the chief innovation officer at PowerOutage.us, told me. “It’s hard to winterize the system,” in part because doing so is expensive. Many places don’t have the money to spend on that project, especially if ice is a rare threat. So lines snap, and trees do too—onto the lines, sometimes. One way to avoid that is to put the lines underground, but, Shafer said, “we built everything overhead in this country.”

Even if a power line doesn’t break, ice can make it so cold that it doesn’t send out enough power, Autumn McMahon, a vice president at Oklahoma Electric Cooperative, told me—“so linemen would have to go out and literally break the ice off of the power lines.” (Much of her state is expected to experience “considerable disruptions to daily life,” according to the National Weather Service.)

But before they can fix a line, workers have to be able to get to it. Ice makes that more difficult, Tony Robinson, a former administrator of FEMA Region 6 who now works for National Emergency Management and Response, told me. Utility companies are good at restoring power relatively quickly during a storm, but “if the ice is too bad and they’re not able to get their equipment to the site”—well, that slows things down. And delayed power restoration “is obviously concerning,” the Oklahoma-based meteorologist Alan Gerard told me, “especially since many homes in this part of the country are not insulated or prepped for cold weather.” Pipes can freeze or burst, and people could be without water.

This is the type of storm that can tighten the aperture of people’s lives for a time. Thousands of flights have already been canceled. The safest way to drive on an ice-slicked road is not to drive at all. In a power outage, keeping warm can mean hunkering down in one room of the house, blanketing the windows and doors overnight, and staying put.

Then there’s the snow. Snow poses far less of a risk of power outages than ice does, but it is a hazard on roads, especially in areas that may not have snow plows. But even then, ice is a sneaky villain: States are aggressively pretreating their roads for snow and sleet, “but with freezing rain, it just washes that away, and then you’re left with an ice rink,” Rachel Riley, the director of the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program, told me. Maue is particularly concerned about areas that get ice then snow, which can create a crust on surfaces that’s then difficult to shovel.

Whatever version of frozen water hits the ground this weekend will linger. Much of the country will remain cold into next week or even into early February. Icy piles of snow will line icy sidewalks that line plowed and salted roads. Maue has been saying that the country will be “entombed” in ice.

But some areas are just going to be quite cold, with a fresh layer of snow—a relative rarity in some of those places. That can bring unfamiliar challenges but also unfamiliar delights. Kids may have “their first real snow,” North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said at a press briefing yesterday. But much of the state, he said, will see not snow, but ice. Today, he took a more urgent tone, telling residents to be prepared to be stuck at home for a few days. “This is a serious storm,” he said. “We are taking it seriously, and so should you.”</div>

More detections for wearers of crappy monitors that those that wear no monitor at all.

A few more studies and they should discover that more wearers of quality monitors detect even more incidents than iCrap monitors.

My spouse has felt for some time she had some type of arrhythmia. In office ECGs never detected anything. She has a Samsung watch (not the latest version) that detects abnormal heart patterns. It pops up with &#39;you have AFib&#39;. Meh, figures it&#39;s bogus. During one of her episodes, she initiates an ECG, AFib is the result. At a regular doc visit she mentions it to her PCP. They open up the app, find the displayed data, and doc concurs; she has AFib. They do a 24 hr monitor and confirm AFib. In conversations with her PCP and the cardiologist the docs confirm that they&#39;re seeing people with smart watches that do, in fact, have things like AFib that are confirmed on further testing. This seems to be a real thing. I&#39;m sure there are false positives and likely false negatives so it would be good to have actual clinical data but in the absence of real studies, if you have one of these that pops a message, see your doc.

Gamechanger! How many freaking times a week do you see this? Why wasn&#39;t this ever the word of the year at some point?

It might be 100 times better at concentrating the PFAS, and better at disposing of it, but the critical question is whether or not it&#39;s 100 times cheaper than the alternatives to disposing of the PFAS, along with the legislative will to actually force the filtering for cleaning the stuff up.Well, even 10% cheaper would be enough if the will exists.  The cheaper cleaning it up is, the easier that sell is.Just look at Flint Michigan for how cheap water companies and municipalities can be.

I agree that the economics of the process are key to whether it can be widely implemented. TFA does include some limited discussion. The point it makes that the new filters can be retrofitted to existing filtration systems to make them more effective, rather than requiring totally new systems to be built sounds potentially interesting, but there is not even an estimate of the cost of wide-scale adoption.

No, you cannot retrofit existing filtration systems to support the &quot;low&quot; temperature of 500C. I hope that helps.

No, the critical question is whether it can be made to be 100 times cheaper than the alternatives of the PDAS IN THE FUTURE.

What about R&D do you not understand? What? You think new materials spring forth immaculately from the Lab yelling &quot;I&#39;m Here! Yea!!!&quot;

These people need to get out of the lab occasionally!

That is we are thinking to bring pfas from one place and move them somewhere else.

Nah. The paper says it&#39;s first absorbed, then the filter media is defluorinated with heat in the presence of calcium carbonate, and the fluorine compounds break down and form CaF2, which is a harmless salt. (It wouldn&#39;t be great to eat a lot of, but fluoride salts are what we use in dental treatments.)

I wonder if it&#39;s a problem that the defluorination was done in under argon? That doesn&#39;t seem like something that would be done at a water treatment plant.

Why do you make up these stories? They&#39;re increasingly elaborate and desperate.

The deaths and moreover the rapes in illegal immigration are verifiable but you want to pay below poverty level wages services benefitting you.  You are disgusting

you are a moron of enormous proportions. You have no clue about the real everyday situation, but instead spout bullshit to make yourself seem &quot;cool&quot;.People DIE every day lead by coyotes thru a parched desert, but you sound cool so keep it up....

I wish you weren&#39;t, but it has been made abundantly clear that you are in no way turned off by cruel violence.

No &quot;dumb stories&quot; were mentioned, all verifiable fact.

Why don&#39;t the 49 other states just leave D.C. and join the Republic of California?

Because those other states are busy taking in refugees from California.

No, but furries are pretty fun to watch during their convention downtown.Srsly?

&quot;The difference between anecdote and data is a clip board.&quot;

Lol, this is the combination of words you think says, &quot;I am a smart person&quot;?

Is this in-group signalling BS such a habit that you even have to do it online? What is your specific criticism of the comment?

I take your point, but I want to mention that this is the opposite of costly signalling. It&#39;s like taking a dump then calling that a costly contribution to the municipal sewage system.

It sounds like you&#39;re saying &quot;I supported when the US used these soft power tactics to influence global politics, but the thought of other countries maybe doing it, even in situations where I have completely imagined it as a self-oriented justification for why I&#39;m mad at my own movement being restricted once *in theory*, is justification for us to attack them with weapons.&quot; with a little touch of &quot;I don&#39;t understand the difference between domestic and international finance and shouldn&#39;t ha

I want my Cabinet to be like Xi’s. I’ve never seen men so scared in their lives

[Xi]’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great... And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day

[Xi&#39;s] an incredible man... highly respected by everybody.

It&#39;s a great honour to be with a friend of mine, really for a long time now — the very, very distinguished and respected President of China

On the contrary, Ayn Rand can&#39;t even imagine a working economy in her fiction, let alone creating ideas that work in the real world.

The smart people took the shots. The pure blooded got sick or dead.

Antivaxers have had a real weird tendency to be very agressive about it, so a lot of folks got their shots and kept their mouths shut to avoid the harassment and bullying from the daft uncles and idiot son youtube-believers.

Ask any doc, they got  a *tonne* of these quiet vaxxer &quot;Dont tell my husband&quot; type requests.

We&#39;re not talking about you, your left hand and the voices in your head here, pal.

You should spend all your money in the casino. Literally every winner I know won in the casino. Why are you still poor, go to the casino right now and put it all on red.

Welcome to the world of survivorship bias. The problem with people who have survivorship bias is that they are usually dumb.

Fox is by far the highest rated cable news channel. Would they not be mainstream by definition?

Somebody drank the Fox bullshit Kool-Aid.

Vaccine choice to employment? That’s fucking hilarious. That happened in states with “at will” employment laws. Meaning you could be fired for any reason. Republicans loved that until it suddenly affected them.

They should be careful! Soon they have not only ICE and National Guard in the country, but a carrier - or two - in front of their coast!

so what happens when the federalies get pisssy that california decided to join WHO on its own? will the “states rights” zealots defend this? my guess is no, they won’t. i wonder why.

The GOP only cares about &#39;states rights&#39; when they&#39;re out of power in the federal government. But, when they&#39;re in power, they trample over state&#39;s rights more than any Democrat.  Fucking hypocrites.

Has this happened?No?Are you imagining something just for the sake of arguing against it?Yes.That is a strawman.

Yeah, healthcare is some woke bullshit. Fuck trying to prevent disease, let them die. More for me.

I am in general against division. Instead, I truly believe in working together, cooperation, (not competition), union of countries. I dream of a world government.

But, considering what Trump s doing, like an excellent selfish barbarian, I encourage strongly California to leave USA and become an independent country. It is sad, but perhaps it is a way to restore some kind of civilization in this part of the world.

If you read the summary, you&#39;ll find they allege these fees affected everybody, not just the people that used contactless payment. You could contest this but you&#39;d find there is economic theory about &quot;who pays&quot;, even in a simple case like a tax, and serious thinkers wouldn&#39;t take your argument seriously.

Using a physical card gives up some privacy. Apple Pay and Google Pay give the retailer a one time card number that can&#39;t be associated with your real one.

If Apple is secretly pulling illegal tactics they should be held accountable for that, wouldn&#39;t you agree?

This coming from someone in the land of ambulance-chasing-lawyers and people who sue their neighbours at the drop off a hat, I&#39;ll bet.

Hidden fees aren&#39;t so hidden outside the USA:  The UK consumer watch-dog should have addressed this problem, years ago.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, Slate’s weekly politics newsletter that needs to seriously ramp up its war crimes, and soon, if we’re going to snag a Board of Peace seat.

This week, oh brother. We’ll just say upfront that there was so much Minnesota/ICE stuff to consider that we decided to not include any of it (this is called “news judgment”), though we would refer you to other excellent Slate content here. We do however talk about the Minnesota Senate race, and observe how Bill and Hillary Clinton are going to jail for a million years (unconfirmed). Plus, an old-fashioned look at Trump’s poll numbers, one year in.

But first, Canada: Can we trade you for Mark Carney??

Most contemporary political speeches are terrible, flattened into pablum and crowd-pleasing safety, delivered by empty vessels, then forgotten within the hour. Yet the address from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a collected and poised former central bank head, will, we fear, be remembered for a long time. While he didn’t mention names, he did speak quite precisely of the recent “rupture” in the world order in which “great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” In other words, the great powers—such as the neighbor to which Canada’s economy has been deeply linked for decades—have begun to throw their weight around unreliably and turn on their own partners. That means it’s time for “middle powers,” like Canada or major European countries, to orbit around different suns, to diversify, and to work together outside the restraints of the broken American-led order. We encourage you to read it yourself. (Once you’re done with the Surge—no clicking away!)

This, in a nutshell, is the risk of Donald Trump. While it was good that Trump called off the dogs on a hostile takeover of Greenland—for the moment—in his own Davos address the next day, the damage was already done. You can only threaten NATO, threaten global institutions, threaten or implement tariffs, and threaten the sovereign territory of your allies so much before they’ll deem you an unreliable partner and begin to turn away. It’s just a rational response. Trump has a psychological need—wholly unfixable, at this point—to push buttons and wield power recklessly until it causes a stock market dip, at which point he walks it back. The stock market reverses, but the long-term damage to America’s brand doesn’t.

Congratulations to everyone for making it a full year through Donald Trump’s second presidency! How many years are left? Eh, counting is for nerds. Let’s review how Trump’s political standing has changed over the past year. If you’ll recall, Trump’s favorability rating down the stretch of the 2024 election and leading into his inauguration was the highest it had ever been. That revealed new strengths about his second coalition, as it had made great strides with previously Democratic constituencies like young people and nonwhite voters.

One very exciting year later, all of that is back in the dumps. His job approval is lousy, hovering just north of 40 percent on average. And, as a New York Times/Siena poll this week demonstrated, much of that hemorrhaging support comes from the new blocs of voters he had acquired last year. Nearly 70 percent of registered voters under 30 disapprove of Trump, along with nearly 60 percent of Hispanic voters. Democrats, meanwhile, lead the generic congressional midterm ballot by 5 points—something that’s about in line with the polling average leading into this fall. This is in spite of Democrats, still, being historically loathed. Democrats will have to fix themselves ahead of 2028. (Who knows how!) But the midterms will primarily be a referendum on Trump, and it’s shaping into a horror story for the GOP. Trump’s reaction to the NYT poll was to threaten legal action against the Times.

Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Trump during his 2021 impeachment trial. This made political life challenging for Cassidy after Trump retook the presidency. To succeed in the 2026 primary in his solid red state, Cassidy would need Trump’s support, or at least his neutrality. So Cassidy spent the past year as one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders. Even when he had a chance to block the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose overt agenda was to destroy everything Cassidy had learned in his career as a physician, Cassidy held his nose and offered his support.

It was all for naught. Last weekend, Trump urged Rep. Julia Letlow to challenge Cassidy and offered her his endorsement. Reporting suggests this was always Trump’s plan, and he just wanted to get through peak legislating season before he risked alienating Cassidy and his vote. Cassidy has pledged to remain in the race for now, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will have his back as it always does with incumbents. But his fate may have been sealed when he cast that impeachment vote. He should wear that as a badge of honor and speak out against the administration more frequently in 2026—though we’re not holding our breath.

Last September, Trump forced out a U.S. attorney in the D.C. area who was trying to do his job honestly and replaced him with Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer from Florida, who was willing to defy all career prosecutors’ advice and indict the president’s enemies. She indicted a couple of them—former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—only to have those indictments tossed out when a federal judge determined in November that Halligan had been illegally appointed to her job. Halligan nevertheless kept showing up to work, as a sort of Schrödinger’s U.S. attorney.

Halligan’s tenure came to an end this week when federal judges humiliated her out the door. A federal judge in Richmond concluded that “this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end,” struck her title from all filings, and said the only reason it would refrain from “referring her for further investigation and disciplinary action” was because she “lacks the prosecutorial experience that has long been the norm for those nominated to the position of United States Attorney in this District.” A separate judge, meanwhile, directed the clerk to publish a job listing for Halligan’s vacant role in local newspapers. What do you think, should the Surge apply?

This week, the NRSC announced with great fanfare its latest recruit: former NFL sideline reporter turned conservative political commentator Michele Tafoya will run for the Minnesota Senate seat left vacant by Sen. Tina Smith’s retirement. This effectively closes out the NRSC’s offensive map for 2026, as it plans to contest Democratic seats in Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Minnesota. Their argument for the Minnesota seat is that Trump came within 4 points of winning it in 2024, and state Democrats have suffered from scandals surrounding mass social services fraud.

Uh huh. The national environment in 2026 is shaping up to be much different than it was in 2024, and those state scandals’ impact on Dems might be offset by the Trump administration’s more recent decision to send in Immigration and Customs Enforcement and, potentially soon, the military to Minnesota. But! At least a quality recruit could force Democrats to spend some cash in Minnesota. So is Tafoya a quality recruit? Time will tell, though her name recognition will be high. Yet we can’t help but be tickled by her initial message. “For years, I walked the sidelines when the stakes were the highest, and that job taught me how leadership really works,” Tafoya’s team wrote in a social media post alongside her launch video. Her qualification for leadership is that she was quite literally on the sidelines while leadership (in football) was happening nearby. By that logic, we must remind you that the Surge has interviewed former football coach Tommy Tuberville. Do we get a Minnesota Senate seat now?

The House Oversight Committee, which has been conducting its own investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, voted to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas to testify. This came after a lengthy back-and-forth between the Clintons’ lawyers and the Oversight Committee about whether the committee’s subpoena was merely an effort to embarrass them, given that the Clintons have already shared what “little information” they know. It’s now a question of whether—when, really—the contempt resolution gets a full House vote, and then whether the Justice Department pursues charges.

Is Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer trying to embarrass the Clintons and turn some of the main-boss energy in the Epstein saga away from Trump? Of course. But what was most catching about the vote was how nine Democrats on the committee joined Republicans to hold Bill Clinton in contempt, while three voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt. There’s a couple of political factors at play here. First, Democrats do not want to appear, at this stage in the Epstein saga, to be protecting their own from consequences as they pursue the truth. Second, Democrats pursued quite a few contempt resolutions when they held the House in the Biden years, and giving up on their righteous indignation about the importance of complying with congressional subpoenas wouldn’t smell right. Anyway: Bill and Hillary to serve as inaugural prisoners at the reopening of Alcatraz? (Remember that?)

As of Thursday, the House has passed all 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government, at new levels and reflecting new needs, for the remainder of the fiscal year—and only four months behind schedule, which isn’t too bad! The Senate, assuming senators can ax their way past treacherous ice demons and through the Capitol doors, expects to vote on the final few bills next week. This is the first time since the Biden administration that Congress has passed all new appropriations bills; the government has been running on a series of continuing resolutions, extending old funding levels, since 2024.

So how did this happen? There was bipartisan recognition among appropriators—led by Rep. Tom Cole on the Republican side and Rep. Rosa DeLauro on the Democratic—that they needed to if they wanted to be taken seriously anymore. Passing another CR reflecting old needs, and ceding a proactive congressional power of the purse, would have further emboldened the executive branch and anti-government Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to do with federal spending as he pleased. “If we wouldn’t have been able to do this, then Congress would have been, frankly, diminished in a way that would have been bad for our republic,” GOP Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart told reporters. Now Congress is back, and the republic is saved!

Remember to salt your steps and walkways, the last thing anyone needs this weekend is a broken neck. Cheers!

The evidence is mounting that ICE is not only unbothered by moral boundaries, but immigration and customs enforcement agents acting on behalf of President Trump believe they are not constrained by constitutional red lines, either. According to a super-secret internal memo flagged in a whistleblower complaint this week, the Fourth Amendment simply doesn’t apply to ICE. That sense of impunity is also clear in a growing chamber of horrors from their enforcement operations; from masked agents taking a child in a blue bunny hat, to the shooting of Renee Good. Worryingly, this sweeping concept of immunity is kind of true—though maybe not for the reason you think. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick talks with Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation & Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. He is also the director of the Center for Rights and Justice and Co-Director of the Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy. Alex explains the origins of qualified immunity—a legal theory that allows law enforcement officers to be free from consequences for their actions—why ICE’s lawlessness is not a new phenomenon (even if it is a phenomenon in hyperdrive under Trump), and what we can do about the obvious problem of maximal impunity for the people who have the most power to inflict harm.

This week, the Department of Justice forged ahead with criminal investigations into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey—just a few days after Minnesota filed suit against Homeland Security over its surge of federal agents in and around the Twin Cities. State Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty are also being roped in and face subpoenas. The federal government is considering whether to charge Minnesota officials with conspiracy to impede federal agents’ immigration enforcement duties, but the case is clearly doomed to the same failure that met President Donald Trump’s efforts to prosecute political adversaries New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey. While those cases fell on technicalities, the investigations of the Minneapolis officials look likely to topple on more straightforward grounds: An administration that postures as fierce defenders of First Amendment rights is targeting these officials purely for their speech. While this effort is destined to fail, it still has the power to inflict long-term damage.

“The government may not take action based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Period, full stop,” former U.S. Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Litman explained to Slate. Litman hosts the Talking Feds podcast, and he explained that the DOJ appears to be going after Walz and Frey through a federal statute that makes it a crime for local officials to conspire to prevent, force, intimidate, or threaten an officer who is required to perform their duties.

In order to prove Walz and Frey conspired against federal agents, the DOJ is likely going to attempt to use their public comments against them. For instance, Walz called the deployment of federal agents in Minnesota “sensationalized operations” and also put out a public statement urging people to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully.” Frey, during a separate press conference, made national waves when he said, “To ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here.”

To almost anyone hearing those comments, Walz’s and Frey’s statements would not amount to a “conspiracy.” The obvious reality is that the Trump administration simply has beef with the public statements Walz and Frey have made and is trying to intimidate them and any other critics of ICE’s brutal—arguably murderous—recent tactics.

The issue for the DOJ in this case is that these statements don’t clear the bar of the federal statute it’s trying to invoke. “It has to be an agreement to use force, threat, or intimidation to impede federal officials,” Litman explained, and those threats have to produce imminent lawless action—known as the Brandenburg standard. Previous Supreme Court jurisprudence has confirmed this, with the court ruling that even speech where someone is calling for unlawful action is protected under the First Amendment, until and unless it actually results in a tangible crime. “The basic idea is that the First Amendment line is really robust and really extensive and it stops at the point, but only at the point, where some really bad shit is just about to go down because of your words,” Litman explained.

Another problematic element to the DOJ’s strategy is the fact that they have issued subpoenas to the state attorney general and the local prosecutor, both of whom have pledged to look into investigating Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good. Litman said it’s highly irregular to subpoena a prosecutor, and particularly problematic in this instance when the federal statute the DOJ is using to investigate may not hold up to scrutiny in court. On top of that, grand jury rules dictate that prosecutors cannot just hand out subpoenas in order to dig around for new information or to harass someone; they must be in pursuit of a legitimate crime.

To Litman, the bottom line is that the president is clearly using the threat of criminal prosecution to further threaten our constitutional democracy. As he told me, the message to local officials across the country who are already experiencing federal agents in their cities and to those who may be next is: “If you argue with me politically, I’ll see your ass in court—and maybe in jail.”

This week, President Donald Trump suffered a string of defeats that exposed the real limits of his power at home and abroad. First, his Justice Department abandoned its efforts to illegally appoint Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer, as U.S. attorney, yielding to a furious judicial rebuke of its dirty tactics. Then the president dropped his threat to seize Greenland through military force or ruinous tariffs in the face of stiff international resistance. At almost the same time, the Supreme Court threw cold water on his bid to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Minneapolis residents continue to protest, thwart, and document his violent assault on immigrant communities.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the vital lessons to be gleaned from these victories against the president’s abuses of power. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This story feels symbolic of the theme we wanted to talk about this week, which is that sometimes standing up to Trump really works. In November, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had illegally installed Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney in Virginia and threw out her sloppy indictments of James Comey and Letitia James. But somehow Halligan refused to leave the office and kept claiming the title. When a different judge, David Novak, told her to stop, she filed this seething reply, with full backing from Pam Bondi’s DOJ, calling him a partisan hack. Tell us how he responded this week.

Mark Joseph Stern: This was one of the most incandescent judicial opinions I think I have ever seen. And, by the way, this is a Trump appointee; he’s not a flaming liberal. But Novak accused Halligan of wildly unprofessional conduct and openly breaking the law. This was a master class in dressing down the class clown. He wrote that her brief “contains a level of vitriol more appropriate for a cable news talk show and falls far beneath the level of advocacy expected from litigants in this Court, particularly the Department of Justice.”

Novak also pointed out that the chief judge of the 4th Circuit has made the ruling against Halligan’s appointment binding across the district, so Halligan was “simply flouting a judicial order because of a disagreement” by pretending to still hold the office. He wrote: “Ms. Halligan’s response asserts that she is free to act in an unlawful capacity, because she disagrees that she does so unlawfully. But that’s not how our legal system works.” And he went on: “The Eastern District of Virginia has long enjoyed the service of experienced prosecutors” who “shared an unwavering commitment to the Rule of Law, putting the interests of the citizens of the District before their own personal ambitions, as true public servants do. Unfortunately, it appears that this ethos has come to an end.”

Obviously, Novak was not backing down. He struck Halligan’s title as U.S. attorney from all relevant filings. And he said that while professional discipline—including potential disbarment—would have been appropriate, he would give Halligan “the benefit of the doubt” because of her unusual “inexperience” as a prosecutor. That was an extraordinary way to say: You are so unprofessional and inexperienced that I’m not even going to discipline you because you never had any business in this position in the first place.

The really important thing here is that, in a world in which these folks act as though they have boundless impunity to do what they want, it is incredibly important for judges to say no. It’s the cornerstone of how we think about the judicial role. That said, I have to read one more smackdown. Novak wrote: “No matter all of her machinations, Ms. Halligan has no legal basis to represent to this court that she holds the position. … This charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end.”

This is a historic dressing-down of somebody who thought they were made of Teflon. A few months ago, Halligan was asserting that she had the power to jail the president’s political foes on a pretext. And this humiliation is compounded by the fact that the chief judge of the district court posted a notice on Tuesday that the position of U.S. attorney was vacant—because even if Halligan had been appointed legally, her 120 days in the office were officially up. How did Halligan react to these slights?

She gave up, which is not what I expected. It was entirely possible that the Trump administration would attempt to reappoint her as interim U.S. attorney for another 120 days and try to fight this out till the end. Instead, it surrendered. Bondi announced on social media that Halligan would no longer seek to serve in the position. That is a victory for all the judges who stood up to this unlawful appointment. And it took me by surprise because the Justice Department’s filing earlier sounded like the opening salvo of a major battle over the limits of a president’s power to install his crony as top prosecutor. Then, when the DOJ got shot down and embarrassed and threatened with actual consequences, it just tucked in its tail and limped away.

There’s another topic I want to discuss in this same key. As late as Tuesday, America’s allies seem to be gearing up for a full-on confrontation with Trump over his deranged quest to seize Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a stem-winder of a speech at Davos promising to defend Greenland’s sovereignty and bemoaning Trump’s “rupture” of the rules-based international order. Then, on Wednesday, in the face of all this, Trump just rolled over and gave up?

He conceded defeat. He said he was not going to use military force to seize Greenland, which was the threat that he had been pushing for days—tanking the markets, terrifying the allies, forcing Denmark and Greenland to prepare for possible battle with the United States. He just said: Never mind, I’m not going to do that. Then he purported to secure a deal with NATO that would give the U.S. unlimited access to Greenland, something we already have under current agreements. So he didn’t do anything at all. He imperiled the entire world order to end up with the status quo.

When Carney gave that speech, and world leaders gave him a standing ovation, I was worried. I wondered: Is this the provocation? Is this the moment we truly become a rogue nation? Are the tanks going to be rolling into Greenland? And instead, Trump gave up, just as he did with Halligan. The truth is that he’s weak. He is not the muscular president he pretends to be on television. When someone says no, and uses tools at their disposal to enforce that boundary, he stands down, because he is terrified of being defeated in a way that he can’t spin as a secret victory.

That’s particularly salient in a week when so many horrors have befallen residents of Minnesota who are standing up to genuine tyranny. It may be tempting to slide into defeatism. But your point is that Donald Trump is a cartoon strongman’s idea of a strongman, right? He’s not actually very strong. If people and institutions and businesses and government stand up to him, he crumples.

Let’s braid into that a conversation we had earlier in the week about the Supreme Court arguments over Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve. The justices were like: What? You can’t do this. We can’t have the Fed at the mercy of a president who goes on pretextual fishing expeditions to go after people he doesn’t like. The point here seems to be: Don’t cede all this power to him. And maybe if SCOTUS would grow a spine, this could end tomorrow.

You observed on Wednesday that a lot of the justices sounded pissed. They were like: How did we get to this point? And it’s their own fault! They gave Trump so much leeway in all of these earlier cases to break the law. Then they seemed irked when he crossed the line that they had tried to draw in the sand over the Federal Reserve. They seemed to wonder: How could this happen? Well, look in the mirror. When you capitulate, you empower Trump to push further past your limits. That’s the lesson that the international community seems to have learned, and that our more courageous judges in the lower courts have learned. Let’s just hope that John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett are learning it now, because it’s one of the few things that could turn around this catastrophe.

With Trump, you’ve got to hold the line, or else you just get bowled over. That is what everyone out in the streets in Minnesota is doing right now, and we are seeing the results. The average protester blowing a whistle on the streets of the Twin Cities has shown more courage than John Roberts has in maybe his entire career.

It’s remarkable how many times Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump, and people come away dazed and stupefied, as if they haven’t witnessed the spectacle over and over before.

It happened again this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In his speech on Wednesday, our president doubled down on his odd obsession over Greenland, demanding U.S. ownership of the icy island, insisting that he needs it for national security, and telling European leaders, in the pose of a Mafia don, “You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.”

Trump had threatened, a few days earlier, to impose 100 percent tariffs on European nations that opposed his takeover plans. It seemed, this time, he wasn’t going to back down from his own ruinous demands.

And then he backed down. Just a few hours after his speech, which was unusually hostile by even his standards, he emerged from a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, announced that they’d worked out the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland, so there’d be no need for an invasion or for any punitive tariffs. Asked about the details of this framework, Trump said, “We’ll have something in two weeks”—his usual timetable for putting off important decisions, or sometimes evading them altogether.

In other words, Trump the Godfather had once again transformed into the TACO Man—the derisive acronym for “Trump Always Chickens Out,” coined after the first couple of times he threatened tariffs, then backed off, early on in his second term as president.

But this time, the syndrome played out differently. The targets of the threat, in this case the leaders of European nations, were in the same room, watching in real time. They’d gathered earlier, to work out a unified stance, and they were energized by one of their own, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose speech, the day before Trump’s, laid out a clear path for how medium-sized countries, working together, can outmaneuver the dictates of large powers that abuse the rules they created for their own benefit. (Carney is no starry-eyed idealist, having once been the head of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.)

In short, the Europeans did something that Trump, with some reason, thought they would never do—they held firm. They threatened to invoke the Anti-Coercion Instrument (nicknamed “the Bazooka”), which allows the European Union to counter economic pressure from third nations with tariffs and penalties of its own. The bazooka was designed as a deterrent—and it seems to have deterred. It was a major reason why Trump backed down. The financial markets’ response to Trump’s speech probably also played a role; the S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent, some bankers worried about a run on the dollar and a sell-off of Treasury notes. (The stock market recovered its losses, and financiers’ panic abated, after the president chickened out.)

Many European leaders—and probably some of Trump’s aides too—heaved a huge sigh of relief. For all the wishful talk of “strategic autonomy,” at least by some EU members, they prefer mutually productive relations with the United States. The dollar still reigns supreme in global transactions, and a reliable U.S. military presence is crucial to Europe’s security, at least for the next decade.

Yet under Trump, relations with the U.S.—for not just the Europeans but all of America’s traditional allies—are neither productive nor reliable. And his backpedaling on Greenland, while welcome, doesn’t alter this clear reality. In fact, in some ways, it intensifies the pervasive aura of insecurity. Trump came to Davos so insistent in his belligerence, so determined to pursue U.S. interests as he saw them (however misguided he was about what those interests really were)—then, within hours, shifted 180 degrees with no explanation and only the vaguest outline of an alternative plan. How, from now on, can anyone take seriously any threat or promise Trump makes? He is still, by default, the leader of the free world and, by constitutional powers, the commander in chief of the world’s most lethal military establishment—yet how can anyone rely on anything he says?

We have been creeping, for some time now, toward this crisis (crisis is not too strong a word for what we’re facing), but the summit in Davos dramatized it. It did so in two ways. First, Trump’s speech was so hostile and his subsequent retreat was so airheaded. (No one could convincingly claim, as some have in the wake of previous reversals, that Trump was playing some wizard’s game of four-dimensional chess.) Second, and more important, the leading allies publicly talked about his behavior and found in Carney’s speech—which they greeted with (a rarity at Davos) a roused standing ovation—a way of moving out of the old order’s grip.

It’s unclear whether they’ll be able to sustain this pivot toward a “third way.” The United States still has, as Trump likes to put it, lots of “cards” to play in tit-for-tat games of leverage. Still, the landscape is changing. China is exploiting the trans-Atlantic transition (or, as Carney described it, the “rupture”), moving into markets that had previously been closed; even before his Davos speech, Carney signed a high-profile trade deal with Beijing. The EU negotiated a similar deal with South American nations, similarly designed to bypass Washington’s control. Denmark announced that it would sell its stockpile of U.S. Treasury notes, valued at $100 million, at the end of the month. This isn’t as much as it may seem; the EU holds about $10 trillion in U.S. assets. Still, it’s an unusual gesture fraught with at least symbolic significance.

Trump has responded to the growing discontent with dismissive contempt. In his Davos speech, he bellowed that, without the United States, much of the world “wouldn’t be making anything”; that without his own efforts, “you wouldn’t have NATO,” which gives us “absolutely nothing” in return; and that if America hadn’t entered World War II, “you’d all be speaking German”—a bizarrely crude thing to say in Switzerland, where the most commonly spoken official language is German.

Yes, the U.S. holds a lot of cards. But Trump doesn’t realize that the game is changing and that, under the emerging set of new rules, his cards are slowly but steadily declining in value.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/neurophos_hopes_to_revive_moores_law/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Moore&#39;s Law slows to a crawl and the amount of energy required to deliver generational performance gains grows, some chip designers are looking to alternative architectures for salvation.

Neurophos is among those trying to upend Moore&#39;s Law and make good on analog computing&#39;s long-promised yet largely untapped potential.

The Austin, Texas-based AI chip startup says it&#39;s developing an optical processing unit (OPU) that in theory is capable of delivering 470 petaFLOPS of FP4 / INT4 compute — about 10x that of Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Rubin GPUs — while using roughly the same amount of power.

Neurophos CEO Patrick Bowen tells El Reg this is possible in part because of the micron-scale metamaterial optical modulators, essentially photonic transistors, that the company has spent the past several years developing.

&quot;The equivalent of the optical transistor that you get from Silicon Photonics factories today is massive. It&#39;s like 2 mm long. You just can&#39;t fit enough of them on chip in order to get a compute density that remotely competes with digital CMOS today,&quot; he explained.

Neurophos&#39; optical transistors, Bowen says, are roughly 10,000x smaller. &quot;We got our first silicon back in May demonstrating that we could do that with a standard CMOS process, which means it&#39;s compatible with existing foundry technologies.&quot;

Using these transistors, Neurophos claims to have developed the optical equivalent of a tensor core. &quot;On chip, there is a single photonic tensor core that is 1,000 by 1,000 [processing elements] in size,&quot; he said.

This is quite a bit bigger than what&#39;s typically seen in most AI accelerators and GPUs, which employ matrix multiplication engines that are at most 256x256 processing elements in size.

However, rather than having dozens or even hundreds of these tensor cores, like we see in Nvidia&#39;s GPUs, Neurophos only needs one. Bowen tells us the tensor core on its first-gen accelerator will occupy roughly 25 mm2.

The rest of the reticle-sized chip is &quot;the boondoggle of what it takes to support this insane tensor core,&quot; Bowen said.

Specifically, Neurophos needs a whack-ton of vector processing units and SRAM to keep the tensor core from starving for data. This is because the tensor core itself — and yes, again, there&#39;ll only be one of them on the entire reticle-sized die — is operating at around 56 gigahertz.

But because the matrix-matrix multiplication is done optically, Bowen notes that the only power consumed by the tensor core is what&#39;s needed to drive the opto-electrical conversion from digital to analog and back again.

Neurophos says its first OPU, codenamed the Tulkas T100, will feature a dual reticle design equipped with 768 GB of HBM that&#39;s capable of 470 petaOPS while consuming 1 to 2 kilowatts of power under load.

As impressive as all this sounds, it&#39;s important to remember that these figures are more like goal posts at this point. The chip is still in active development with full production not expected to begin until mid-2028. Even then, Bowen doesn&#39;t expect it to ship in large volumes. &quot;We&#39;re talking thousands of chips. Not tens of thousands of chips.&quot;

While Neurophos believes its optical tensor cores can address a broad array of AI inference workloads, it expects its first chip will be used primarily as a prefill processor.

As we&#39;ve previously discussed, LLM inference can be broken into two phases: a compute intensive prefill stage in which input tokens are processed, and a memory bandwidth bound stage in which output tokens are generated.

Over the past year or so, we&#39;ve seen chip designers like Nvidia disaggregate prefill and decode into separate pools of GPUs. For its latest generation of GPUs, Nvidia has developed a dedicated prefill accelerator that it calls Rubin CPX.

Bowen envisions the Tulkas T100 filling a similar role as Rubin CPX. &quot;The current vision, which is subject to change, is basically we would put one rack of ours, which is 256 of our chips, and that would be paired with something like an NVL576 rack,&quot; he said.

Long-term, Bowen aims to tackle the decode phase as well, but notes that a variety of technologies, including co-packaged optics, will need to be developed before the startup is ready to take on token generation.

While the Tulkas T100 won&#39;t ship until at least 2028, Bowen says the company is actively working on a proof of concept (PoC) chip to validate the compute and power densities it&#39;s claiming.

This week, Neurophos completed a $110 million Series-A funding round led by Gates Frontier, with participation from Microsoft&#39;s venture fund and other investors, which Bowen says will fund development of this PoC. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/24/home_office_small_boats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK Home Office is spending up to £100 million on intelligence tech in part to tackle the so-called &quot;small boats&quot; issue of refugees and irregular immigrants coming across the English Channel.

The Whitehall department&#39;s Border Security Command (BSC) is on the hunt for a &quot;maritime situational awareness system&quot; it says should &quot;autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range.&quot;

The official prior information notice marks engagement with vendors for a system set to fuse &quot;data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)&quot; drones with existing platforms.

The continued flow of refugees, asylum seekers, and irregular immigrants has become a major focus of UK politics in recent years, with successive governments keen to be seen to act in response to adverse publicity.

The Home Office notice said it had decided to combine its requirement for a real-time view from land-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) with the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) of the Maritime Domain Awareness service, which provides security and regulatory enforcement data and was already the subject of a separate procurement.

It now plans to merge the two into a single procurement: the Coastal Maritime ISR Service.

The Home Office said that under the deal, suppliers would &quot;strengthen the UK&#39;s response to clandestine entry and wider maritime security by delivering a scalable, managed service that provides enhanced domain awareness and supports operational decision-making.&quot;

&quot;The solution will autonomously detect, track, and identify small boats and non-cooperative vessels at range, fusing data from land-based and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) sources with existing platforms,&quot; it said. BVLOS is shorthand for piloting drones without being able to directly see them.

The winning bidder will be expected to integrate data from satellite-based automatic identification, radar, and drone-based sensors to create a &quot;Tracks as a Service&quot; in near real-time via an API to the Royal Navy Maritime Domain Awareness Programme (MDAP) and connect to the Home Office, a &quot;common operating picture accessible to key decision-makers and first responders.&quot;

&quot;A supplier portal will provide camera feeds, alternative track displays, and alerts, ensuring flexibility to meet short-notice operational requirements across the UK, Crown Dependencies, and British Overseas Territories,&quot; the notice said.

The contract is set to last between three and five years, including any extension periods, and could be worth £100 million for the full five-year term.

Research from campaign group Progressive International claims private companies won around £3.5 billion in contracts for UK border security since 2017, including &quot;contracts specifically related to the regulation of people moving across the English Channel in small boats.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency won&#39;t attend the annual RSA Conference in March, an agency spokesperson confirmed to The Register.

&quot;Since the beginning of this administration, CISA has made significant progress in returning to our statutory, core mission and focusing on President Trump&#39;s policies for maximum security for all Americans,&quot; CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told us. &quot;CISA has reviewed and determined that we will not participate in the RSA Conference since we regularly review all stakeholder engagements, to ensure maximum impact and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.&quot;

McCarthy declined to comment on whether the decision had anything to do with former CISA director Jen Easterly being named chief executive of RSAC last week.

Easterly, who was appointed to lead America&#39;s top cyber-defense agency under the Biden administration, joined her predecessor and CISA&#39;s first-ever director Chris Krebs in President Trump&#39;s line of fire back in July.

In a now-deleted LinkedIn post, the US Military Academy at West Point announced that Easterly - who graduated from West Point in 1990 - would return to the academy as a Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point&#39;s Department of Social Sciences, where she previously taught economics and national security.

Soon after, far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticized Easterly&#39;s appointment on X, and the next day, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed West Point to rescind Easterly&#39;s offer before she even began her new gig.

Last week, Easterly announced that she&#39;s joined RSAC as its new CEO, and almost immediately, rumors began swirling that Trump cybersecurity officials would boycott the industry&#39;s &quot;largest and most influential conference&quot; to protest Easterly&#39;s appointment.

NextGov reported that officials in the White House Office of the National Cyber Director, National Security Council, and CISA all discussed canceling their appearances at the annual conference in San Francisco.

The Register also reached out to the Office of the National Cyber Director and the National Security Council, and did not receive any response.

Federal cyber officials historically have active speaking roles at RSAC, with both Easterly and Krebs previously delivering keynotes, speaking on panels with other government network defenders, and talking to the press. In 2024, Easterly and co even wrangled nearly 70 tech providers into signing a Secure by Design pledge.

That all changed, however, last year, with the National Security Agency abruptly canceling its popular State of the Hack panel and CISA declining any press interviews or roundtable discussions.

In a last-minute addition to the 2025 agenda, however, Homeland Security boss Kristi Noem did appear on the keynote stage and said CISA had gone off the rails. She vowed to put the agency &quot;back on mission.&quot;

A year later, however, it appears that she&#39;s been sidetracked with ICE&#39;s militaristic occupation of major American cities. ®

            <div id="article-text">Ofcom is formally investigating whether Meta complied with legally binding information requests regarding WhatsApp&#39;s role in the UK business messaging ecosystem.

The case, published on Ofcom&#39;s own enforcement register on Friday, centers on two statutory &quot;section 135&quot; notices issued to Meta on July 31, 2024, and June 19, 2025, under the Communications Act 2003.

Those notices required Meta to hand over data on how WhatsApp Business competes in the application-to-person messaging market – the unglamorous stuff companies use to ping customers about parcels, appointments, and login codes.

Ofcom said the information it received so far may not have been complete or accurate. In statutory requests like these, accuracy isn&#39;t a suggestion: it&#39;s a legal requirement, and failure to comply can trigger enforcement action under section 138 of the Act.

&quot;The information gathered through statutory information requests is a key part of Ofcom&#39;s work and informs how it carries out its statutory functions as a regulator,&quot; the watchdog said. &quot;It is therefore crucial that stakeholders provide accurate and complete information in a timely fashion.&quot;

Ofcom declined to say what details provided by Meta may have been questionable when asked by The Register.

In a statement to The Register, Meta said: &quot;We take regulatory obligations seriously and devote significant resources to responding to requests for information in a timely and accurate manner. We will cooperate with Ofcom in its investigation.&quot;

The probe adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches for Meta in the UK and Europe – from child protection age-checks to gambling ad scrutiny – as competition authorities globally tighten oversight of Big Tech.

Ofcom will publish further updates on its enforcement page as the inquiry develops. ®

            <div id="article-text">You&#39;ve got to keep your software updated. Some unknown miscreants are exploiting a critical VMware vCenter Server bug more than a year after Broadcom patched the flaw.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-37079, is an out-of-bounds write flaw in vCenter Server&#39;s implementation of the DCERPC protocol that earned a 9.8 out of 10 CVSS rating. In other words: it&#39;s almost as bad as it gets.

DCERPC, which stands for Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls, allows software to invoke procedures and services on a remote system across a network. This bug can be abused by someone with network access to vCenter Server to send specially crafted network packets, potentially leading to remote code execution, and on Friday, both the vendor and the feds warned that this - or something along these lines - is happening.

&quot;Broadcom has information to suggest that exploitation of CVE-2024-37079 has occurred in the wild,&quot; the vendor warned in an update to its June 18, 2024 security advisory.

Also on Friday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added this critical security hole to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This means federal agencies must patch the flaw by February 13 - again, we must note that Broadcom issued a software update that fixes this CVE more than a year and a half ago, and June 2024 would have been the optimal time to deploy the patch.

CISA&#39;s KEV lists the bug&#39;s use in ransomware campaigns as &quot;unknown,&quot; and Broadcom didn&#39;t provide any details about the scope of exploitation, or respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries about CVE-2024-37079&#39;s abuse. We&#39;ll update this story as we learn more about who is abusing this flaw, and what they are doing with the illicit access to enterprises&#39; vCenter Servers.

VulnCheck VP of security research Caitlin Condon told The Register that virtualization infrastructure - including Broadcom&#39;s vCenter Server - is a favorite target for both government-backed hackers and financially motivated cybercriminals.

&quot;As an example, CVE-2023-34048, a prior vulnerability in vCenter Server&#39;s DCERPC protocol, was exploited by at least three known China-nexus threat actors (Fire Ant, Warp Panda, and UNC3886),&quot; Condon said.

Condon said she&#39;s not surprised to see the bug being exploited by attackers considering details about the vulnerability have been public for more than a year.

&quot;It&#39;s common to see threat actors - including state-sponsored groups - opportunistically leveraging even older public vulnerability information to conduct new attacks, so it&#39;s not terribly surprising that the vulnerability has seen exploitation in the wild,&quot; she said.

&quot;While there are no immediate details on threat actor attribution or attacker behavior, vCenter Server should never, ever be exposed to the public internet, so it&#39;s likely the adversary already had a foothold in the victim environment,&quot; Condon added. ®

            <div id="article-text">updated If you think using Microsoft&#39;s BitLocker encryption will keep your data 100 percent safe, think again. Last year, Redmond reportedly provided the FBI with encryption keys to unlock the laptops of Windows users charged in a fraud indictment.

The government case [PDF], which claims defendants in Guam fraudulently collected pandemic unemployment benefits, represents the first publicly known instance of Microsoft providing BitLocker keys, according to Forbes.

BitLocker is a Windows security system that can encrypt data on storage devices. It supports two modes: Device Encryption, a mode designed to simplify security, and BitLocker Drive Encryption, an advanced mode.

For either mode, Microsoft &quot;typically&quot; backs up BitLocker keys to its servers when the service gets set up from an active Microsoft account. &quot;If you use a Microsoft account, the BitLocker recovery key is typically attached to it, and you can access the recovery key online,&quot; the company explains in its documentation.

The situation is similar for managed devices. &quot;If you&#39;re using a device that&#39;s managed by your work or school, the BitLocker recovery key is typically backed up and managed by your organization&#39;s IT department,&quot; the company says.

Microsoft provides the option to store keys elsewhere. Instead of selecting &quot;Save to your Microsoft Account,&quot; customers can &quot;Save to a USB flash drive,&quot; &quot;Save to a file,&quot; or &quot;Print the recovery key.&quot;

But customers are encouraged to entrust keys to Microsoft because as long as they have access to the account online, they can recover the keys, effectively making Redmond their digital doorman. However, in such circumstances, customers no longer have total control over access to their data.

Apple offers a similar device encryption service called FileVault, complemented by its iCloud service. The iCloud service also offers an easy mode called &quot;Standard data protection&quot; and &quot;Advanced Data Protection for iCloud.&quot;

With Standard data protection, Apple holds the encryption keys for iCloud data, with some exceptions (e.g. Passwords and Keychain). With Advanced Data Protection, the company has the keys only to iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar.

Both Apple and Microsoft, like other companies, comply with government information demands they determine to be lawful. But they can&#39;t provide keys they don&#39;t control.

Apple says as much in its guidelines [PDF] for law enforcement: &quot;All iCloud content data stored by Apple is additionally encrypted at the location of the server. For data Apple can decrypt, Apple retains the encryption keys in its US data centers. Apple does not receive or retain encryption keys for [a] customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data.&quot;

That&#39;s not the case with BitLocker, where Microsoft may have access to encryption keys for a customer&#39;s end-to-end encrypted data if the customer allowed that during setup.

Microsoft explains that it does not provide governments with its own encryption keys. But it does not make that commitment with regard to its customers.

&quot;We do not provide any government with our encryption keys or the ability to break our encryption,&quot; the company says in its law enforcement guidance. &quot;In most cases, our default is for Microsoft to securely store our customers&#39; encryption keys. Even our largest enterprise customers usually prefer we keep their keys to prevent accidental loss or theft. However, in many circumstances we also offer the option for consumers or enterprises to keep their own keys, in which case Microsoft does not maintain copies.&quot;

It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.

According to Microsoft&#39;s most recent Government Requests for Customer Data Report, covering July 2024 through December 2024, the company received a total of 128 requests from law enforcement organizations around the world, 77 of which came from US authorities. Only four of the requests during that period, three in Brazil and one in Canada, led to the disclosure of content.

After this story was filed a Microsoft spokesperson said, “With BitLocker, customers can choose to store their encryption keys locally, in a location inaccessible to Microsoft, or in Microsoft’s cloud. We recognize that some customers prefer Microsoft’s cloud storage so we can help recover their encryption key if needed. While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide whether to use key escrow and how to manage their keys.”

&quot;Microsoft is making a tradeoff here between privacy and recoverability,&quot; said Erica Portnoy, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an email to The Register. &quot;At a guess, I&#39;d say that&#39;s because they&#39;re more focused on the business use case, where loss of data is much worse than Microsoft or governments getting access to that data. But by making that choice, they make their product less suitable for individuals and organizations with higher privacy needs. It&#39;s a clear message to activist organizations and law firms that Microsoft is not building their products for you.&quot; ®

Perfect Tides: Station to Station is a deft interactive exploration of being a young adult.

There’s a lot about Perfect Tides: Station to Station’s Mara that I find relatable. Like me, she’s recently moved to a place simply called “the City” from the middle of nowhere, and like me, she’s an avid writer. But these biographical details aren’t the important thing; it’s the way she’s painted by the game’s incredibly sharp writing where I start to feel uncomfortably seen. There are a lot of characters in media that are awkward or socially anxious, but few that are drawn with such piercing specificity.

The point-and-click game is minimalist in its mechanics. Consisting mostly of conversations, it’s broken up by a few puzzles, object interactions, and minigames. This is not a complaint: it’s in talking to people that the game shines, because it’s how we get to see most of Mara. And she’s such a realized and resonant portrait of a person that I found myself grasping at where we were different as a coping mechanism against spending the whole time introspecting. I pride myself, for example, on never having had an awful boyfriend. In this, surely, I could find some self-soothing superiority over this poor video game character.

The dynamics of Mara’s relationship with her controlling, older, long-distance partner are sketched with both narrative and mechanical thoughtfulness. In one conversation, a health bar suddenly appears, and you must navigate a particularly difficult conversation without losing all of your hearts, some of which you gain only if you’ve spent time nurturing other connections. It’s one of many neat metaphors, and combined with the clever moment-to-moment writing, led to a particularly notable moment, which wrenched an “oh, for fuck’s sake” out of my mouth in real life.

It was then that I had completely bought into Station to Station . I thought I had the shape of it. Dear relatable Mara and her messy relationships that I could hold as a simplifying buffer between us. But the game wouldn’t settle for simplicity.

Aside from conversation, the other important mechanic is Mara’s writing. These manifest in assignments for school, guest blog posts, and, in one real low moment for Mara, an overly involved forum post, and you’ll need to combine topics together to complete the piece in question. These topics include the city, music, and sex, and they level up as you talk to people and experience the world. It’s a pretty simple but effective representation of how writing works: you learn things through living and then combine ideas into, hopefully, something new and expressive.

There’s one piece that works differently. Mara writes a story that is clearly a thinly veiled allegory for her own life, and a tutor gives her some relatively harsh feedback. For the rest of the game, the story looms in the back of her mind. You can’t fix this just by combining a thought your friend had about movies and your own ruminations on death caused by your ailing grandmother. But each of those might help a little as you chip away at it bit by bit. Without getting too self-indulgent about my own recent writing experiences, suffice to say Station to Station had once again skewered me. I had Mara work on it whenever I could, every time reminded of my own festering project and the trust necessary to wait and address it slowly.

At this point in the game, it’s clear that the aforementioned partner is not Mara’s only problem. In fact, most of her interactions with other characters are marred in some way or another. I, for one, would simply not get involved with these people! But again, the game resists simplicity. Although it always presents harmful interpersonal dynamics honestly and without excusing bad behavior, it absolutely refuses the idea of shutting yourself away to avoid them. Because you would miss out on too much. Too much joy, too much connection, too much potential.

In one of the only conversations in the game that feels purely uncomplicated and productive, a character tells Mara “you just have to risk it with someone and see.” Station to Station argues, over and over again, that being open to others, despite the risk of awkwardness, and of not being treated well, is worth it. Mara is naive, and not very good at knowing what she wants, let alone asking for it. And she does get hurt. But she also lives a much more beautiful life when she doesn’t close herself off to experiences and people. She deals with the consequences, and through this she learns and grows and flourishes. My knee-jerk perceived superiority in being avoidant is suddenly the crack through which Station to Station has sunk its claws into me. I will be thinking about it for a very long time.

There’s a lot more I could talk about, like the multiple excellent musical interludes, or the hugely exaggerated animations that feel genuinely expressive while also being consistently comedic. I could even complain bitterly about some of the incidental environmental puzzles and the way they ground the story to a screeching halt if you happened to miss one small interaction point. But what kept me thinking about the game long after the credits rolled was its emotional honesty and the emotional honesty it demanded of me while playing it.

After playing the game, I stewed for a couple of days, thinking about Mara, myself, and one particularly memorable bit of karaoke. And then it hit me: I never finished Mara’s rewrite. No matter how important it felt in the moment, it turned out to be much less crucial than Mara and I opening ourselves up and accepting the consequences, good and bad.

Perfect Tides: Station to Station is out now on PC.

By lots of metrics, Gemini is winning. It has raced ahead of OpenAI, become scarily good at creating convincing imagery, and even won Apple’s business. So last week’s news that it was enabling something called Personal Intelligence felt like a victory lap. Personal Intelligence allows Gemini to reference past conversations and access your data in other Google services, including Gmail, Calendar, Photos, and search history, without you specifically prompting it to look in those sources. It’s entirely opt-in, and you choose which apps Gemini can access and which it can’t. It’s in beta and only available to people with AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions at the moment.

If that all sounds familiar, it’s because Gemini already offered the option to hook into your Workspace apps. But it required more work on the user’s part — I always found I needed to explicitly ask it to check something in my email or on my calendar if I wanted it to use those as sources. Now, if the prompt seems like it merits a trip to your inbox to look for an email about a concert ticket, it will do so of its own accord. That’s kind of huge. If you have to be specific with every single prompt and babysit the AI, then it’s no more useful than the timer-setting robot assistants we’ve been using for the past decade.

The titles it suggested to me were annoyingly spot-on

Gemini offers some suggested prompts to try once you enable Personal Intelligence, like having it recommend books you might like based on your interests. The titles it suggested to me were annoyingly spot-on. Another one of these conversation starters resulted in a lengthy chat with strategies for dealing with the lawn in my backyard, which I hate and the crows are picking apart anyway. Gemini offered some native plant options to consider, added reminders to my calendar based on the plan I settled on, and put together a shopping list in Keep that I could bring to the hardware store. Even a couple of months ago, Gemini would routinely fail when I asked it to complete tasks like “Add this to my calendar,” so that’s a significant leap forward.

The thing is, Gemini gets out over its skis in other ways. I had it brainstorm some new bike routes, asking it to incorporate a stop at a coffee shop. It obliged, and its high-level recommendations were good, though it struggled with the finer details. Trying to nail down specific routes was painful; it would give me a link to a route it claimed to have created in Google Maps, but clicking through to the map showed me a different set of directions. I’m also not convinced about its plan to send me through the woods on some unpaved trails, culminating into a left turn cutting across several lanes of traffic on a busy road, so I’ll probably stick to the routes I know.

That’s the problem. Gemini can analyze my interests and make some pretty good guesses about what I’d be interested in; it’s the details where AI gets lost. I asked it to look for some neighborhoods I might be less familiar with to recommend for an afternoon outing to take pictures and (naturally) get a coffee. It used my personal data to correctly work out that I’d previously lived in Ballard and shouldn’t include it as a recommendation. The overall list it came up with is solid; the specific locations it recommended weren’t always right.

It claimed a restaurant in South Park was in Georgetown, said I would find a Caffe Umbria in the Old Rainier Brewery building (none exists there), and heartily endorsed a T-shirt shop that is quite obviously closed based on its Google Maps listing. I had to do enough fact-checking and reprompting that it all started to feel like more work than it was worth.

It all started to feel like more work than it was worth

That might be Gemini’s biggest immediate challenge. A year ago, it needed a lot of babysitting to get to the personal information I needed, and it got stuff wrong regularly. Now, it can do the personal stuff reliably — but getting details wrong is a pretty big bug. You only need to show up once at a vacant storefront to decide you’re done using Gemini. That’s not even touching the privacy aspect of it all. Gemini referenced my husband and child by name in one of our conversations. It’s one thing to know that that information is trivially easy to find with access to my email and calendar; it’s another thing to hear their names out loud.

Misgivings aside, I think the inclusion of Personal Intelligence has increased the scope of what I’ll use Gemini for — but only slightly, and I wasn’t using it a whole lot in my day-to-day to begin with. I have a schedule for my yard work and a list to take to the neighborhood nursery, where I’ll ask an actual human if I’m on the right track. Maybe doing that initial planning with Gemini will be what helps me feel just confident enough to get started, even if I end up course-correcting down the line. That’s not a bad tool to have. But you can bet I’m going to be watching my step on whatever path it recommends for me.

Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 113, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, please send hot cocoa to my freezing-cold house, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)

This week, I’ve been reading about private garbage collectors and vintage watches and My Favorite Murder, watching The Running Man (which was not great) and Sinners (which was extremely great), giving my Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses another whirl, nostalgia-tripping my way through The Format’s new album, sitting in the audience for the first Star Search on Netflix, finally reading Dungeon Crawler Carl because roughly 40,000 of you recommended it, and spending way too many hours wrestling with plane Wi-Fi. Life is too short for plane Wi-Fi, my friends.

Bit of an abbreviated issue this week — it’s a short week, and has also been an unusually bananas one both personally and professionally. But too much good stuff to just take the week off! So consider this an Installer Lite. A Mini Installer. A “bug fixes and performance improvements” update, if you will. But we’ve got a smartphone you need to check out, a new soundtrack to work to, some smart thoughts on Hollywood, and more. Let’s do it.

(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / listening to / playing / buying / reading by the fire this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.

“A friend recently introduced us to Boomerang Fu. As adorable anthropomorphic foods, you hurl boomerangs to neatly slice each other in madcap local multiplayer chaos rounds. Remaining the last food standing as the various power-ups stack up becomes increasingly hilarious. Our whole family loves it.” — E.E.

“Clawdbot. It runs on your machine and you can message it using Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, or even iMessage, whichever is most accessible to you — and it can do anything you’d expect from something like Claude Code or ChatGPT Codex. It can also connect to a bunch of other tools, so it can interact with nearly every aspect of your digital identity. It can even rewrite its own code if you ask it to, which can get into some dangerous territory if you’re not careful.” — Drake

“Going on two weeks with Bazzite after switching from Windows on my main gaming PC!

“I’m convinced musicians have the best gadgets. Right now, I’m putting hours upon hours into the Dirtywave M8, which is the most compact, powerful music-making tool. It’s also made by a single person. It even comes with a hex key, welcoming you to repair and mod it yourself. I think more people should know about it. I’ve also had my share of fun with the OP-XY from Teenage Engineering, but it felt too restricted in an ‘Apple’ way, as opposed to the geeky freedom of the M8.” — Jakub

“Currently obsessed with The Iron Snail on YouTube. Best content on clothing I have seen in years.” — Nishant

“I held out for a while, but I eventually gave in and bought PowerWash Simulator 2. As a result, I’ve completely abandoned all real chores around the house.” — Nic

Life is busy right now. Life is busy all the time, for all of us, I suspect. In my endless quest to rethink my relationship with screens and technology, I’ve found that I constantly don’t do, or read, or watch things I want to, simply because they feel like too much commitment. I can just look at TikTok or Instagram for five minutes, but if I’m going to watch a movie or tuck into a book, it feels like a whole thing.

But friends, I have had an epiphany: You actually consume almost anything five minutes at a time. The last couple of weeks, I’ve watched a bunch of movies in 20-minute chunks while my baby napped on top of me. I’ve read multiple books a couple of pages at a time. I’m slowly training myself to read two pages instead of opening TikTok while I wait in line; I’m about to watch every James Bond movie ever, one nap at a time. I still love spending hours with a good movie or good book, but life doesn’t always allow it. Everything can be bite-sized! Bite-size all the things!

A dishwasher is a luxury item some people can’t live without. It’s one of the first major kitchen devices I bought just as soon as I could afford one, and the appliance I thought I’d miss most in my nomadic vanlife pursuits.

Loch sent me its $459.99 / €459.99 countertop Capsule dishwasher to review in a tiny home on a remote beach and inside a van on a two-month roadtrip. It’s an excellent product that washes and dries two place settings quickly at bacteria-killing temperatures up to 75 degrees Celsius (167F) in as little as 20 minutes. It’ll even kill bacteria and neutralize viruses on your gadgets with a waterless blast of UV-C light. Hoozah!

What I learned during this review has less to do with the device’s limitations, and more my own. Turns out that I’m willing to do a lot of dishes by hand when faced with resource scarcity, be that space, energy, water, time, or money; and I’m unwilling to become a germaphobe despite claims that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat.

Cleans and dries in about 20 minutesLooks good on a countertopFits some large pansSanitizes phones and washes fruitDoesn’t require plumbing

The Loch Capsule looks clean and minimalistic on a kitchen counter, in my opinion. And while the exterior is plastic, the tub is made of stainless steel, unlike most countertop dishwashers. This differentiator improves drying speed, durability, and hygiene, while helping to keep odors under control.

The unit is tall and deep enough to accommodate large dinner plates and pans that won’t typically fit inside a short and stout countertop machine. It measures 46.5 x 26.2 x 51.5cm (18.3 x 10.3 x 20.3 inches) giving it a narrow footprint and internal volume of about 30 liters. The integrated handle makes carrying the 12kg (26.4lb) dishwasher relatively easy.

If you’re making all your meals at home then you’ll probably only need to run it once per day for a single-person household, or twice for two persons based upon my experience. It comes with an external clean water tank so it can be used anywhere you have access to power and H2O. No plumbing’s required, but a hook-up is available should you tire of refilling the tank.

Setting it up is pretty straightforward. In most scenarios, you’ll plug into the wall for power, attach and fill the fresh water tank, and run a second hose from the dishwasher to the sink to dispose of the wastewater. In my van, where I had limited space for the Capsule, I had to install it in my “garage” connected to the optional waste water tank since the 1.2m/3.94ft hose was too short to reach my sink.

The glowing white display is covered in capacitive buttons that still respond to touches when my fingers are wet. The look is warm and friendly, but operation is loud, like most countertop dishwashers, something you’ll have to consider for a device meant to be used in small spaces. I measured about 56dB max from one meter. That’s much louder than my own built-in dishwasher, which operates at 38dB. The sound intensity also varies as the water whooshes and the pump vibrates. In other words, it won’t double as a white noise machine while you sleep, if that’s what you’re hoping for.

The Capsule can also wash gadgets and fruit. The basket fits about seven apples, which take eight minutes to wash, or 12 in total if you add UV cleaning. A waterless UV mode can be used to kill surface bacteria on baby bottles and personal devices like phones and earbuds using medical-grade UV-C light.

Loading dishes into the Capsule can feel like playing expert-level Tetris. The first time I tried, it took me about five minutes to load 18 items into that small cavity. Now it takes about a minute or two, while filling and emptying the clean and dirty water containers takes another few minutes. An optional $19 “dual tray” shelf can be placed at the bottom to make space for a large pot, or at the top where it can fill any available free space to wash silverware or other small, flat items.

Several cleaning modes are available, from a 15-minute Meal Wash all the way up to a 152-minute Intensive Clean. I found the 15-minute mode to work so well that I didn’t need to resort to the longer cycles, so long as I didn’t burn anything or wait until the next day to start a wash.

To test, I loaded the Capsule with all the mess produced at breakfast and lunch by two people, including two 10.5-inch plates covered in bacon grease, silverware covered in peanut butter, a milky yogurt bowl, espresso cups, a juice glass, a chef’s knife, tongs, and a sport bottle. And while the diameter of my 12-inch pan does fit inside the Capsule, its handle does not, contrary to Loch’s claim, so I had to handwash it. (My 10-inch pan with 8-inch handle just fits, but the angle doesn’t leave room for much else.)

Everything came out clean, hot to the touch, and mostly dry in the 15-minute Meal Wash mode, on par with my much larger built-in machine. I was impressed. The cycle used 2.5 liters (0.66 gallons) of water and consumed between 220Wh and 300Wh in my repeated tests, with power usage peaking at around 900W. The 15 minute wash cycle actually takes between 20 and 25 minutes to complete. The most intensive wash mode ran for 2 hours and 28 minutes, and consumed 420Wh and almost 4 liters of water.

A 33.3 percent increase on my average daily energy usage and 100 percent increase in water consumption. I can’t justify that.

For comparison, when applying my hippie-approved vanlife dishwashing technique to the same dishes with the same mess, I was able to wash and dry everything – including the 12-inch pan – in just six minutes from one liter of water and zero power consumed. This approach involves wiping everything off with a used paper towel or discarded food packaging, filling a bowl with unheated tap water, dipping in a soapy sponge and getting to work. Mind you, vanlife is less clean than regular life, but we haven’t died yet.

If I installed the Loch Capsule in my van I’d have to run the 15-minute mode twice each day to clean all the dishes my wife and I typically use. That’s about 500Wh and 5 liters of water a day — a 33.3 percent increase on my average daily energy usage and 100 percent increase in water consumption. I can’t justify that. This dishwasher is for rigs carrying a lot more water and battery power than I do, or anyone willing to frequently dock at serviced campsites.

Importantly, vanlifers don’t usually travel with full-sized dishes and pans. So, a more compact countertop dishwasher from companies like Comfee or Farberware that costs around $300 or below might be a better option. Loch does sell a Capsule Solo for $399.99 without the UV stuff and plumbing hookup. It’s otherwise the same dishwasher and currently on sale for $339.99.

Inside a tiny house I still find it hard to justify the $459.99 price tag of the Capsule, even at its sale price of $390.99, despite the surf shack’s ample supply of hot water and electricity. For one or two people, it’s just faster to wash the dishes myself and I don’t lose any precious space on top of the counter, or below it. And all that hand washing leaves me little use for a UV blaster to kill bacteria that doesn’t pose a real threat anyway.

To justify buying a Loch Capsule dishwasher you, and at most one other household member, must really hate washing dishes, have ready access to water and power, and have almost no space but still use large pans and dishes. That’s a niche, but one that the Loch Capsule dishwasher fills admirably.

The Loch Capsule is an excellent countertop dishwasher with minor flaws – it’s just not for me.

An internal presentation says nabbing users early ‘leads to brand trust and loyalty over their lifetime.’

Internal documents revealed as part of a child safety lawsuit hint at Google’s plan to “onboard kids” into its ecosystem by investing in schools. In this November 2020 presentation, Google writes that getting kids into its ecosystem “leads to brand trust and loyalty over their lifetime,” as reported earlier by NBC News.

The heavily-redacted documents, which surfaced earlier this week, are linked to a massive lawsuit filed by several school districts, families, and state attorneys general, accusing Google, Meta, ByteDance, and Snap of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that have harmed young users’ mental health. (Snap settled earlier this week).

Google has spent over a decade investing in products built for education, while establishing Chromebooks as a classroom staple. The 2020 document also includes a study on how the laptop brands used in schools have an “influence on purchase patterns.”

Another slide in the presentation highlights a 2017 story from The New York Times, bolding a quote that says Google is part of a battle to “hook students as future customers.” This quote appears multiple times in the presentation: “If you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life.” The document also suggests that YouTube in schools could create a “pipeline of future users” and creators.

At the same time, other slides discuss some of the challenges associated with bringing YouTube to schools, including how the platform is “often blocked” and how “efforts to make YouTube safe for schools have yet to work.” The documents also acknowledge the potential impact of YouTube on mental health, with one 2024 presentation showing a slide that says “many regret time lost when they unintentionally ‘go down the rabbit hole,’” or that YouTube “‘distracted’ them from work or even getting to bed on time.”’

In an emailed statement to The Verge, Google spokesperson Jack Malon says the documents “mischaracterize” the company’s work. “YouTube does not market directly to schools and we have responded to meet the strong demand from educators for high-quality, curriculum-aligned content,” Malon says. “Administrators maintain full control over platform usage and YouTube requires schools to obtain parental consent before granting access to YouTube for students under 18.”

Jury selection for the social media addiction trial will start on January 27th, 2026.

            <h2>Leak: Nvidia is about to challenge ‘Intel Inside’ with as many as eight Arm laptops</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel and AMD have split the Windows laptop market for years, but the x86 players may be getting outnumbered. It’s not just Apple MacBooks and MediaTek-based Chromebooks using Arm chips anymore. There are finally competent Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops running Windows, and — as soon as this spring — Nvidia will finally power Windows consumer laptops with Arm chips all by itself.

They won’t have an Nvidia graphics chip next to an Intel CPU, but rather an Nvidia N1 system-on-chip at the helm — and overnight, a Lenovo leak revealed that the company has built six laptops on the upcoming N1 and N1X processors, including a 15-inch gaming machine.

Dataminer Huang514613 posted the product names to X, which also include 14 and 16-inch models of the Ideapad Slim 5, two variants of the 15-inch Yoga Pro 7, and a Yoga 9 transforming 2-in-1.

You don’t need to take Huang’s word for it alone: this update page for the company’s Legion Space control software still shows the existence of a “Legion 7 15N1X11” gaming laptop, where the “N1X” refers to Nvidia’s gaming SoC.

And just by using Google, I found a publicly indexed web portal where Lenovo has listings for password-protected “Nvidia N1x Portal Prod” and Nvidia N1x Portal Test” websites, too:

Lenovo may be the world’s biggest laptop maker, but it isn’t the only one prepping such laptops. Dell was tipped to launch an Alienware gaming laptop by early 2026 as well, and it may have been prepping a Dell Premium laptop (now XPS) with Nvidia N1X as well. That’s already eight different Nvidia laptops that might be coming.

Three days ago, Digitimes reported that we should expect Nvidia to launch its N1 and N1X laptop platform this spring, with more devices available this summer, after a previous delay — and that the company already has N2 and N2X chips on the roadmap for late 2027.

While we don’t truly know how much power the N1 and N1X have, a Geekbench leak (which has to be taken with a grain of salt; fake specs have been planted there before) suggested the N1X variant may have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070 graphics card and 20 CPU cores, like Nvidia’s GB10 “Superchip” in the DGX Spark mini-PC. I’m comfortable sharing that because Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has all but confirmed the N1 and GB10 are two halves of the same coin.

Nvidia’s Arm PC chips have been a long time coming, but the company has powered consumer devices with Arm before. Every Nintendo Switch carries an Nvidia Tegra chip, and that Tegra line previously powered tablets up to and including the original Microsoft Surface RT, as well as Nvidia’s one-off Shield handheld and Shield TV set-top-boxes. These ones are built in collaboration with MediaTek, though.

AMD is also reportedly working on its own Arm chips for future Microsoft Surface devices.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

After falling steadily for decades, the prevalence of global hunger is now on the rise—nowhere more so than in sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s indigenous crops are often more nutritious and better suited to the hot and dry conditions that are becoming more prevalent, yet many have been neglected by science, which means they tend to be more vulnerable to diseases and pests and yield well below their theoretical potential.

Now the question is whether researchers, governments, and farmers can work together in a way that gets these crops onto plates and provides Africans from all walks of life with the energy and nutrition that they need to thrive, whatever climate change throws their way. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <h2>“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.
