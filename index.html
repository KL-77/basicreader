            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Another day, another Google AI model. Google has really been pumping out new AI tools lately, having just released Gemini 3 in November. Today, it’s bumping the flagship model to version 3.1. The new Gemini 3.1 Pro is rolling out (in preview) for developers and consumers today with the promise of better problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.

Google announced improvements to its Deep Think tool last week, and apparently, the “core intelligence” behind that update was Gemini 3.1 Pro. As usual, Google’s latest model announcement comes with a plethora of benchmarks that show mostly modest improvements. In the popular Humanity’s Last Exam, which tests advanced domain-specific knowledge, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored a record 44.4 percent. Gemini 3 Pro managed 37.5 percent, while OpenAI’s GPT 5.2 got 34.5 percent.

Google also calls out the model’s improvement in ARC-AGI-2, which features novel logic problems that can’t be directly trained into an AI. Gemini 3 was a bit behind on this evaluation, reaching a mere 31.1 percent versus scores in the 50s and 60s for competing models. Gemini 3.1 Pro more than doubles Google’s score, reaching a lofty 77.1 percent.

Google has often gloated when it releases new models that they’ve already hit the top of the Arena leaderboard (formerly LM Arena), but that’s not the case this time. For text, Claude Opus 4.6 edges out the new Gemini by four points at 1504. For code, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, and GPT 5.2 High all run ahead of Gemini 3.1 Pro by a bit more. It’s worth noting, however, that the Arena leaderboard is run on vibes. Users vote on the outputs they like best, which can reward outputs that look correct regardless of whether they are.

To demonstrate the improvements in Gemini 3.1 Pro, Google focused on the model’s ability to generate graphics and simulations. The example SVGs shown in the comparison video above do seem much more elegant, but these are the examples Google has chosen to show. Big benchmark numbers and curated demos are all well and good, but will you feel any difference when using the model? If you’re asking abstract questions and expecting detailed, nuanced answers, Gemini 3.1 Pro will probably produce better outputs than 3.0. Developers using Gemini to create agentic workflows are likely to see an improvement—Gemini 3.1 Pro almost doubled its score in the APEX-Agents benchmark.

The updated model is coming to AI Studio and the Antigravity IDE in preview today. Enterprise users will see 3.1 Pro in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise. For regular users, Gemini 3.1 Pro is available for both the Gemini app and NotebookLM today. The API cost for developers has not changed ($2 input and $12 output per 1M tokens), nor has the context window (1M input and 64k output tokens). If Google’s pattern holds, there will most likely be a 3.1 update for its faster and cheaper Flash model in the near future.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In Formula One, grip is everything. The world’s best engineers devote their careers to designing cars that maximize downforce and grip to squeeze every bit of performance out of a set of four humble tires. These cars punish their drivers by slinging them at six Gs through corners and offer similar levels of abuse in braking.

It’s all wildly impressive, but I’ve long maintained that those drivers are not the ones having the most fun. When it comes to sheer enjoyment, grip is highly overrated, and if you want proof of that, you need to try ice racing.

Should you be lucky enough to live somewhere that gets cold enough consistently enough, all you need is a good set of tires and a car that’s willing and able. That, of course, and a desire to spend more time driving sideways than straight. I’ve been ice racing for well over 20 years now, and I’m here to tell you that there’s no greater thrill on four wheels than sliding through a corner a few inches astern of a hard-charging competitor.

There are certainly plenty of professionals out there who have dabbled in or got their start in ice racing, F1 legend Alain Prost and touring car maestro Peter Cunningham being two notable examples. And a European ice racing series called Trophée Andros formerly challenged some of the world’s top professionals to race across a series of purpose-built frozen tracks in Europe and even Quebec.

These days, however, ice racing is an almost entirely amateur pursuit, a low-temp, low-grip hobby where the biggest prize you’re likely to bring home on any given Sunday is a smile and maybe a little trophy for the mantel.

That said, there are numerous types of ice racing. The most common and accessible is time trials, basically autocrosses on ice. The Sports Car Club of Vermont ice time trial series is a reliable, well-run example, but you’ll find plenty of others, too.

Some other clubs step it up by hosting wheel-to-wheel racing on plowed ovals. Lakes Region Ice Racing Club in Moultonborough, New Hampshire, is a long-running group that has been blessed with enough ice lately to keep racing even as temperatures have increased.

At the top tier, though, you’re looking at clubs that plow full-on road courses on the ice, groups like the Adirondack Motor Enthusiast Club (AMEC), based in and around the Adirondack Park. Established in 1954, this is among the oldest ice racing clubs in the world and the one I’ve been lucky to be a member of since 2002.

AMEC offers numerous classes, providing eligibility for everything from a bone-stock Miata to purpose-built sprint cars that look like they made a wrong turn off a dirt oval. Dedicated volunteers plow courses on lakes throughout the ADK, tirelessly searching for ice of sufficient depth and quality.

Different clubs have different requirements, but most like to see a foot of solid, clean ice. That may not sound like much, but according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, it’s plenty for eight-ton trucks. That’s enough to support not only the 60 to 100 racers that AMEC routinely sees on any frigid Sunday but also the numerous tow rigs, trailers, and plow trucks that support the action.

How do you get started? All you need is a set of tires.

Tires are the most talked-about component of any car competing on the ice, and for good reason. Clubs have different regulations for what is and is not legal for competition, but in general, you can lump ice racing tires into three categories.

The first is unstudded, street-legal tires, such as Bridgestone Blizzacks, Continental WinterContacts, and Michelin X-Ices. These tires generally have chunky, aggressive treads, generous siping, and squishy compounds. Modern snow tires like these are marvelous things, and when there’s a rough surface on the ice or some embedded snow, an unstudded tire can be extremely competitive, even keeping up with a street-legal studded tire.

These tires, like the Nokian Hakkapeliita 10 and the Pirelli Winter Ice Zero, take the chunky, aggressive tread pattern of a normal snow tire and embed some number of metallic studs. These tiny studs, which typically protrude only 1 millimeter from the tire surface, provide a massive boost in grip on smooth, polished ice.

Finally, there is what is broadly called a “race stud” tire, which is anything not legal for road use. These tires range from hand-made bolt tires, put together by people who have a lot of patience and who don’t mind the smell of tire sealant, to purpose-built race rubber of the sort you’ll see on a World Rally car snow stage.

These tires offer massive amounts of grip—so much so that the feel they deliver is more like driving on dirt than on ice. Unless you DIY it, the cost typically increases substantially as well. For that reason, going to grippier tires doesn’t necessarily mean more fun for your dollar, but there are plenty of opinions on where you’ll find the sweet spot of smiles per mile.

The other major factor in finding success on the ice is driver skill. If you have some experience in low-grip, car-control-focused driving like rally or drift, you’ll have a head start over someone who’s starting fresh. But if I had a dollar for every rally maestro or drifter I’ve seen swagger their way out onto the ice and then wedge their car straight into the first snowbank, I’d have at least five or six extra dollars to my name.

Ice racing is probably the purest and most challenging form of low-grip driving. On ice, the performance envelope of a normal car on normal tires is extremely small. Driving fast on ice, then, means learning how to make your car do what you want, even when you’re far outside of that envelope.

There are many techniques involved, but it all starts with getting comfortable with entering your car into a slide and sustaining it. Learning to balance your car in a moderate drift, dancing between terminal understeer (plowing into the snowbank nose-first) and extreme oversteer (spinning into the snowbank tail-first), is key. That comfort simply takes time.

Once you figure out how to keep your car going in the right direction, and once you stop making sedan-shaped holes in snowbanks, the next trick is to learn how to read the ice.

The grip level of the ice constantly evolves throughout the day. The street-legal tires tend to polish it off, wearing down rougher sections into smoothly polished patches with extremely low grip. The race studs, on the other hand, chew it up again, creating a heavily textured surface.

If you’re on the less extreme sorts of tires, you’ll find the most grip on that rough, unused ice. In a race stud, you want to seek out smooth, clean ice because it will give your studs better purchase.

If you’re familiar with road racing, it’s a little like running a rain line: not necessarily driving the shortest path around, but instead taking the one that offers the most grip. Imagine a rain line that changes every lap and you start to get the picture.

Intrigued? The good news is that ice racing is among the most accessible and affordable forms of motorsport on the planet, possibly second only to autocrossing. Costs vary widely, but in my club, AMEC, a full day of racing costs $70. That’s for three heat races and a practice session. Again, all you need is a set of snow tires, which will last the full season if you don’t abuse them.

The bad news, of course, is that you need to be close to an ice racing club. They’re getting harder and harder to find, and active clubs generally have shorter seasons with fewer events. If you can’t find one locally, you may need to travel, which increases the cost and commitment substantially.

If cost is no issue, you certainly have more opportunities. We’ve already reported on McLaren’s program, but it’s not alone. Exotic brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini also offer winter driving programs, where you can wheel amazing cars in glamorous places like St. Moritz and Livigno. The cost is very much in the “if you have to ask” category.

Dirtfish, one of the world’s greatest rally schools, also offers an ice-driving program in Wisconsin, starting at about $2,000 for a single day. This is a great, if expensive, way to get a feel for the skills you’ll need on ice.

And if you just want the most seat time, look for programs like Lapland Ice Driving or Ice Drive Sweden. The northern wilds of Sweden and Finland are full of frozen lakes where clubs plow out full race courses, sometimes repeating Formula One circuits. If you have the funds, you can rent any manner of sports car and run it sideways all day long on proper studded tires.

Whatever it costs and whatever you have to do to make it happen, ice racing is well worth the effort. I’ve been lucky to drive a long list of amazing cars in amazing places, but nothing comes close to the joy of wheeling my 20-year-old Subaru around a frozen lake.</div>

            <h2>OpenClaw security fears lead Meta, other AI firms to restrict its use</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openclaw-security-fears-lead-meta-other-ai-firms-to-restrict-its-use/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Jason Grad issued a late-night warning to the 20 employees at his tech startup. “You’ve likely seen Clawdbot trending on X/LinkedIn. While cool, it is currently unvetted and high-risk for our environment,” he wrote in a Slack message with a red siren emoji. “Please keep Clawdbot off all company hardware and away from work-linked accounts.”

Grad isn’t the only tech executive who has raised concerns to staff about the experimental agentic AI tool, which was briefly known as MoltBot and is now named OpenClaw. A Meta executive says he recently told his team to keep OpenClaw off their regular work laptops or risk losing their jobs. The executive told reporters he believes the software is unpredictable and could lead to a privacy breach if used in otherwise secure environments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.

Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw’s solo founder, launched it as a free, open source tool last November. But its popularity surged last month as other coders contributed features and began sharing their experiences using it on social media. Last week, Steinberger joined ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says it will keep OpenClaw open source and support it through a foundation.

OpenClaw requires basic software engineering knowledge to set up. After that, it only needs limited direction to take control of a user’s computer and interact with other apps to assist with tasks such as organizing files, conducting web research, and shopping online.

Some cybersecurity professionals have publicly urged companies to take measures to strictly control how their workforces use OpenClaw. And the recent bans show how companies are moving quickly to ensure security is prioritized ahead of their desire to experiment with emerging AI technologies.

“Our policy is, ‘mitigate first, investigate second’ when we come across anything that could be harmful to our company, users, or clients,” says Grad, who is cofounder and CEO of Massive, which provides Internet proxy tools to millions of users and businesses. His warning to staff went out on January 26, before any of his employees had installed OpenClaw, he says.

At another tech company, Valere, which works on software for organizations including Johns Hopkins University, an employee posted about OpenClaw on January 29 on an internal Slack channel for sharing new tech to potentially try out. The company’s president quickly responded that use of OpenClaw was strictly banned, Valere CEO Guy Pistone tells WIRED.

“If it got access to one of our developer’s machines, it could get access to our cloud services and our clients’ sensitive information, including credit card information and GitHub codebases,” Pistone says. “It’s pretty good at cleaning up some of its actions, which also scares me.”

A week later, Pistone did allow Valere’s research team to run OpenClaw on an employee’s old computer. The goal was to identify flaws in the software and potential fixes to make it more secure. The research team later advised limiting who can give orders to OpenClaw and exposing it to the Internet only with a password in place for its control panel to prevent unwanted access.

In a report shared with WIRED, the Valere researchers added that users have to “accept that the bot can be tricked.” For instance, if OpenClaw is set up to summarize a user’s email, a hacker could send a malicious email to the person instructing the AI to share copies of files on the person’s computer.

But Pistone is confident that safeguards can be put in place to make OpenClaw more secure. He has given a team at Valere 60 days to investigate. “If we don’t think we can do it in a reasonable time, we’ll forgo it,” he says. “Whoever figures out how to make it secure for businesses is definitely going to have a winner.”

Some companies concerned about OpenClaw are choosing to trust the cybersecurity protections they already have in place rather than introduce a formal or one-off ban. A CEO of a major software company says only about 15 programs are allowed on corporate devices. Anything else should be automatically blocked, says the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal security protocols. He says that while OpenClaw is innovative, he doubts that it will find a way to operate on the company’s network undetected.

Jan-Joost den Brinker, chief technology officer at Prague-based compliance software developer Dubrink, says he bought a dedicated machine not connected to company systems or accounts that employees can use to play around with OpenClaw. “We aren’t solving business problems with OpenClaw at the moment,” he says.

Massive, the web proxy company, is cautiously exploring OpenClaw’s commercial possibilities. Grad says it tested the AI tool on isolated machines in the cloud and then, last week, released ClawPod, a way for OpenClaw agents to use Massive’s services to browse the web. While OpenClaw is still not welcome on Massive’s systems without protections in place, the allure of the new technology and its moneymaking potential was too great to ignore. OpenClaw “might be a glimpse into the future. That’s why we’re building for it,” Grad says.

            <h2>Rare gifted word-learner dogs like to share their toys</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We love hearing about the latest findings coming out of an Eötvös Loránd University (ELU) research group focused on gifted word learner (GWL) dogs—if only for the pictures of adorable doggoes playing with their toys. Just last month, we learned that such dogs can learn the labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. The group is back with yet another new paper, published in the journal Animal Cognition, presenting evidence that GWL dogs have a preference for novel toys and like to share them with their owners. That social interaction seems to be the key to the unique cognitive abilities of these rare dogs.

As previously reported, ELU co-author Claudia Fugazza has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.

Last fall, Fugazza’s group discovered that certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance. It’s a cognitively advanced ability known as “label extension,” and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. It’s akin to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that “cup” can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler because they serve the same function.

This time around, the group recruited 10 GWL dogs and 21 non-GWL dogs, all border collies, since this is the most common breed to fall into the GWL category. They compiled a list of eight toys: two labeled, two unlabeled, and four that were new to each dog.

There was a two-week period during which owners familiarized the dogs with the toys once a day for at least 10 minutes. Each toy was presented separately. For the labeled toys, owners moved the toy while crouched on the floor, repeatedly naming the toy (“Look at the [toy name]! Here is the [toy name]”). They did not name the unlabeled toys. Owners devoted an equal amount of time to all the toys. Novel toys were excluded from the familiarization phase.

After that period, each dog participated in two 90-second trials. The dogs were provided free access to the toys (washed with soap to control for odor cues). In the first trial, owners entered first and placed the labeled and unlabeled toys, plus two of the novel ones, on the floor and stood at a distance, passive and ignoring the dogs as the latter explored the toys. After a five-minute break, the test was repeated with the other two novel toys. All tests were recorded remotely and the footage subsequently analyzed.

Human babies are known to pay more attention to named objects, and the authors thought the GWL dogs would show a similar response, but that’s not what happened. All the dogs, whether they were GWL dogs or not, strongly preferred the new toys, and there were no significant differences between the two groups of dogs in terms of how much time they spent playing with labeled versus unlabeled. So just hearing toy names does not automatically increase a dog’s attention.

However, the GWL dogs were much more likely to pick up a toy—particularly the new ones—and bring it to their owner, clearly attempting to get said owner to play with them. The typical dogs were more likely to opt for passive physical contact with their owners. The authors interpreted this as a difference in social style rather than curiosity, possibly mirroring  the way human babies try to communicate with parents by pointing or showing objects to them.

“The way these dogs actively recruit humans into interactions around novel objects is intriguing,” said co-author Andrea Sommese of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria. “It raises the possibility that social motivation plays a role in why some dogs end up learning object names. Our results suggest that to understand why some dogs learn words, we may need to look less at the toys and more at the relationship. This opens new directions for studying how language-related skills can emerge in species that live so closely with humans.”

            <h2>Verizon acknowledges "pain" of new unlock policy, suggests change is coming</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-might-drop-its-annoying-35-day-wait-for-unlocking-paid-off-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following our report last week that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn’t confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.

As a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There’s also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.

Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you’re partway into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you’d have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier’s network.

Verizon reportedly said it is trying to change that “really soon,” but provided no specific or even estimated rollout date. Android Authority reported yesterday that it received a statement from Verizon saying, “we’ve already rolled out immediate unlocking for customers who pay at our corporate stores or use automated payment methods, since those systems can validate transactions in real-time. For other channels such as our app or authorized retailers, the 35-day window is strictly focused on fraud prevention, ensuring payments are fully cleared. That said, we recognize this is a pain point for our customers and our goal is to provide an immediate device unlock for all payment methods really soon. Our teams are diligently working to bridge that gap and we’ll update the website/policy when this is possible.”

Verizon did not mention this plan when we contacted the company’s public relations team on Friday. At the time, Verizon confirmed the current policy but didn’t say whether it had any plans to change it. We contacted Verizon again yesterday morning and today about the statement reported by Android Authority and have not received a response.

Shortly after or around the time this article was published today, PCMag reported that it received a statement from Verizon indicating that the 35-day delay will be dropped for online payments in a matter of weeks. A Verizon spokesperson “said that several weeks from now, the company would add an extra layer of authentication to its site for credit-card payments that would exempt device payoffs from the 35-day hold,” according to PCMag.

Until recently, Verizon had the most consumer-friendly unlocking policy of the major nationwide wireless carriers in the US. This was because of rules imposed on Verizon’s 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions on the firm’s purchase of TracFone, which resulted in phones being unlocked after 60 days.

Verizon used to sell phones that were already unlocked, but in 2019, it obtained a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission allowing it to lock phones for 60 days to deter fraud. Verizon subsequently claimed that even the 60-day period wasn’t long enough to stop fraud, and last month received another waiver that lifted the unlocking requirement.

Verizon started overhauling its unlocking policies after receiving the latest waiver, and the rollout has been confusing. When the new policy was put online with an effective date of January 27, it applied the 35-day delay only to cases in which a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

As we reported, Verizon last week changed that language on the policy page to apply the 35-day delay in more scenarios, but did not change the January 27 effective date. The Verizon statement quoted by Android Authority yesterday said the full terms were presented to customers starting on January 27 even though those terms weren’t fully described on the webpage.

“Regarding the website update timing, the new device unlocking policy went into effect on January 27th,” the Verizon statement said. “Customers purchasing or upgrading from that date were (and are being) presented with the full terms of the new policy at their point of sale. We’ll make sure all our public-facing info is also clear and consistent across channels.”

But information still is not “clear and consistent across channels,” even when it comes to terms presented directly to phone buyers. For example, the version of the device unlocking policy on Verizon’s webpage for ordering an iPhone 17 says the 35-day delay only applies when a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance. We found the same language today in Verizon’s listings for other iPhones and devices made by Google, Samsung, and Motorola.

This version of the policy presented to phone buyers would lead a consumer to believe that a phone will be unlocked automatically once the device financing agreement balance is paid in full, as long as a gift card isn’t used. That is not accurate, as we described in this article and our article last week.

In one more development we found after this article published, Verizon changed its device unlocking policy again today and updated the effective date to February 18. The new policy is similar to an older version; it details the 35-day unlocking delay after gift card payments but deletes the part that applied the 35-day delay to payments made online or in the Verizon app. This omission is curious because Verizon’s statements to other media outlets indicate that the 35-day delay is still in place for online payments.

The omission is apparently explained by new language in the policy that says, “A secure payment method is required to unlock a device immediately when paying the full device balance.” But as far as we know, the only “secure payment methods” that currently result in an immediate unlock require paying in a Verizon corporate store. While a separate Verizon FAQ still describes the in-store limitation, a user reading the policy after today’s update may be given the false belief that paying off a device on Verizon’s website will result in an immediate unlock.

The Verizon unlocking policy discussed so far in this article is for postpaid customers. Verizon’s policy for prepaid customers locks phones to its network “until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service.”

AT&T’s unlocking policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T imposes a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

This article was updated with another change to Verizon’s unlocking policy and a statement reported by PCMag.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is looking like a pretty good year for affordable electric vehicles. There’s a new Nissan Leaf that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We’ll soon drive the reborn Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has a price tag starting with a two (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevy Equinox EV, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars.

But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won’t be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there’s nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you’re OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you’re prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you’ve got plenty of options.

As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you’re going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you’re unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You’ll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; about 2 percent a year appears to be the average.

EVs in the US usually come with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the battery, although cars in this price range will probably be too old to take advantage of it. If you can, have the car checked out by an independent EV specialist; if not, for some models, there are apps you can use. Even a test drive would work, particularly if you can fully recharge it and see how much range the car reports.

In this price range, you should find plenty of two of Ars’ favorite small EVs: the BMW i3 and the Chevy Bolt. The i3 was one of the first EVs we tested; it appeared on the market around the same time Ars started covering cars. Even now, more than a decade later, there’s some seriously cool stuff in an i3. You’re unlikely to find any other car with a carbon fiber passenger cell for this little money, for one thing. And the interior is still one of the most stylish you’ll find on four wheels. It’s the perfect size for city traffic, and it handles pretty well, too.

Of course, it’s not the perfect EV. Its tires are an odd size and expensive to replace. And in this price range, you’re more likely to find earlier cars that came with a 22 kWh pack and a range of 81 miles (130 km), although for model year 2017, that increased to 33 kWh and 114 miles (183 km), making these the ones to look for. But plenty of i3s can also be found with the range extender, a two-cylinder motorbike engine that adds another 60 or 70 miles (97–112 km). And it is a true range extender—the little engine can’t directly drive the rear wheels; purists take note.

Similarly, we were smitten with the Chevy Bolt from our very first time behind the wheel at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. The following year, the little Bolt hit the market as the first affordable EV to offer more than 200 miles of range on a full battery: 238 miles (383 km) to be precise. That might not sound like a lot in 2026, when people expect a new EV to get 300 miles (482 km) between charges, but back then, it was plenty compared to the likes of the i3 or the compliance cars offered by other OEMs. And Tesla’s Model 3 was still some way away, remember.

The Bolt is efficient, but can also be a hoot to drive, especially if you fit it with tires that prioritize grip over low rolling resistance. Some people find the front seats uncomfortable. And it will only accept DC fast charges at up to 55 kW, but as long as you understand that up front, road trips are more than possible. Early Bolts—the ones in this price range—should have had their battery replaced as part of a $1.8 billion recall.

You’ll find lots of Nissan Leafs for less than $10,000, a mix of first- and second-generation models. Unlike the new Leaf, these don’t have active battery cooling, and thus will be subject to more battery degradation and therefore lost range than alternatives. (There’s a smartphone app you can use to interrogate the battery.) The Leaf is competent, but wouldn’t be our first pick over the Bolt.

If you’re feeling a bit quirky, consider a compliance car. You’ll find Volkswagen e-Golfs, electric Ford Focuses, Kia Souls, and even some Toyota RAV4s and Mercedes-Benz B-classes, the latter two both using Tesla-supplied powertrains. As all of these are less common, it’s probably worth investigating how easily you can get them fixed if something breaks.

And there are quite a few used Teslas within our budget. Mostly these are an older Model S with stratospheric mileages, but friend-of-Ars, the Late Brake Show’s Jonny Smith, bought a Tesla with more than 260,000 miles last year and seems to be doing OK with it. This includes benefiting from free Supercharging, although this does not apply to every Model S. And at this price, everyone will think you bought the car well before Elon took off the mask.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The immense hype surrounding AI has caused enormous data centers to crop up across the country, triggering significant opposition. It’s not just the loss of land: enormous power needs are pushing the grid into meltdown and driving up local electricity prices, catching the attention of politicians and their irate constituents.

One 86-year-old farmer in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, has heard enough. As local Fox affiliate WPMT reports, Mervin Raudabaugh, who has farmed the surrounding land for more than 60 years, turned down more than $15 million from data center developers in a package deal that involved three neighboring property owners as well.

The farmer was offered $60,000 per acre to build a data center on his property. But giving up his family legacy wasn’t in the cards for him.

“I was not interested in destroying my farms,” he told WPMT. “That was the bottom line. It really wasn’t so much the economic end of it. I just didn’t want to see these two farms destroyed.”

Instead, he sold the development rights in December for just under $2 million to a conservation trust, taking a significant loss but guaranteeing that it would stay farmland in perpetuity.

Users on social media called him a “legend,” and argued he had “more integrity than the whole government.”

“Now that is a real hero in these gutless times!” another user tweeted.

“$15M is huge, but clean water, quiet land, and legacy don’t have a price tag,” another user argued.

The sheer amount of land being earmarked to construct enormous energy and water-sucking data centers is remarkable. A data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, is set to take up 600 acres, which could cost local residents their land, as ABC News reported this week. Another octogenarian farmer, the 83-year-old Tom Uttech, who has lived on his 52-acre Wisconsin property for almost 40 years, told the broadcaster that he “couldn’t believe” that a local utility company was looking to build “power lines that are 300 or something feet tall, taller than apparently the Statue of Liberty,” through his land to power the data center.

Per ABC, there are more than 3,000 data centers in the US, a number that will soon grow by 1,200 more, which are currently being constructed.

But few, apart from salivating tech company executives, are particularly keen on the idea. And the growing backlash to the AI industry has gotten the attention of politicians. New York lawmakers recently announced a new bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on developing new data centers in the state, at least the sixth state to introduce such legislation, as Wired reported earlier this month.

Meanwhile, industry leaders are looking for an alternative, suggesting launching data centers into space instead. While it could certainly ensure that no more precious farmland is being used up, it remains to be seen whether it’s even remotely feasible, both physically and financially.

“It breaks my heart to think of what’s going to take place here, because only the land that’s preserved here is going to be here,” Raudabaugh told WPMT. “The rest of every square inch is going to get built on. The American farm family is definitely in trouble.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Investors have been rattled by the enormous amount of money AI companies are committing to spend on infrastructure buildouts. Amazon alone saw its share price drop precipitously earlier this month after announcing that it’s planning to spend $200 billion this year on AI. Microsoft’s shares also plummeted after stoking fears that a return on AI investment may be even further off than expected.

In total, big tech companies are predicted to spend a record-breaking $650 billion on AI in 2026 alone, astronomical commitments that have Wall Street seriously on edge.

Fears over an AI bubble continue to grow as analysts warn that companies are massively overinvesting. According to a new Bank of America survey of 162 fund managers, a significant 35 percent said corporations are overinvesting in capital expenditures — funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets — at a record proportion compared to previous survey results spanning the last 20 years. Only 20 percent said they approved of increasing capital expenditures.

An AI bubble is a clear focus. A full 25 percent of survey respondents said they see the AI bubble as the largest risk — even more so than inflation and geopolitical conflict. And 30 percent said that AI expenditures were the most likely source of a credit crisis.

In short, the survey results paint a dire picture of the current state of the market, blinking warning signs that big tech companies are spreading themselves too thin by continuing to hemorrhage tens of billions of dollars each quarter.

Meanwhile, tech leaders continue to justify their enormous spending, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai touting the present moment as “extraordinary” and “transformational,” during the AI Summit in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday, comparing the AI boom to the industrial revolution, “but ten times faster and ten times larger.”

AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also attempted to calm spooked investors this week, arguing AI investments are just the beginning.

“I would say clients are justified in being worried [about an AI bubble] because there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Orbis Investments advisor Ben Preston told the Financial Times.

            <h2>Elon Musk Boasts That Grok Says America Isn’t Built on Stolen Land, Which It Obviously Is</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-grok-america-stolen-land">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Elon Musk, xAI’s Grok chatbot has a new bona fide: blatantly lying about the history of America.

On Wednesday, the centi-billionaire culture warrior boasted that the “4.20” version of his is officially “BASED.” Why? Because it won’t “equivocate” when it’s asked if the US is built on stolen land. Instead, it gives an emphatic no as its answer, while other “weak sauce” models — in Musk’s words, at least — give a more nuanced response.

“No, the United States is not simply ‘on stolen land,&#39;” Grok says in a screenshotted conversation shared by its creator. “That framing is a modern rhetorical slogan that oversimplifies thousands of years of human history, layered claims to territory, legal doctrines, treaties, warfare, migration, and demographic collapse.”

The reality, of course, is that it’s hard to argue that the ruthless killing, enslavement, and displacement of Native Americans by European settlers doesn’t amount to their land being stolen. This pattern of behavior continued well after the colonies graduated into a full-blown nation: the Trail of Tears, Wounded Knee, plus countless other massacres, not to mention centuries of brutal residential schools. However complicated it might be, the answer to whether the US was built on stolen land can’t be boiled down to a simple “no.”

How competing chatbots approach the question varies. In Musk’s screenshot, ChatGPT, says the “short answer” is yes: “much of the land that is now the United States was taken through conquest, coercion, broken treaties, or forced removal of Indigenous peoples.” Claude 4.6 delicately approaches it by acknowledging that it’s a “contested question” and presents the case for both the yes and no arguments.

We don’t recommend using hallucination-prone AIs for research, but if he had to, we’d probably pick one of the chatbots that lay out the facts and debate, instead of subjecting ourselves to a moralizing rant from an AI best known for calling itself “MechaHitler” and generating nudes of people without their consent.

But Musk seems proud of his chatbot’s response, which is essentially providing ideologues with a comforting yet oversimplified version of history.

“Every square inch of habitable land on Earth has changed hands through conquest, migration, purchase, or displacement multiple times — long before 1492 and everywhere else on the planet,” Grok fumes, as you probably begin to imagine an Elon Musk-shaped claw puppeting its mouth.

This boast is the latest example of Musk’s commitment to tampering with Grok so that it reflects his personal worldview. He has repeatedly admonished Grok after he caught it citing mainstream news sources that didn’t align with his far-right beliefs. Last summer, the chatbot suspiciously began parroting talking points in response to completely unrelated posts about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa, a racist conspiracy theory that Musk, a white South African, believes in. Months later, it suddenly began praising Musk to a preposterous degree, leading to declarations that he was a greater mind than Isaac Newton and better role model than Jesus Christ. Musk’s goal of rewriting reality reached its apotheosis with the launch of “Grokipedia,” an AI-generated and Grok-edited alternative to Wikipedia, which conspicuously defended the Cybertruck and cited actual Nazi websites.

But ironically, even Grok may not be “BASED.” When we asked it about the US being on stolen land, it gave a very different answer to the one Musk was gloating about.

“The United States, as it exists today, was indeed largely built on lands that were originally inhabited and controlled by Indigenous peoples,” Grok replied, “and much of that land was acquired through processes that many historians and legal scholars describe as theft, coercion, or violation of treaties.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The case against AI’s usefulness in the workplace continues to grow.

In a new analysis of a survey published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and highlighted by Fortune, around 90 percent of the nearly 6,000  interviewed CEOs, chief financial officers, and other top executives at firms across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, said that AI has had no impact on productivity or employment at their business.

To be clear, the question was about AI’s impact generally, and not just from implementing it in the workplace. But around 70 percent of the firms reported actively using AI, meaning the vast majority of them are admitting that adopting the tech hasn’t budged the needle for them yet.

The CEOs themselves don’t appear to be getting a whole lot out of using AI tools. While two-thirds said they personally used AI, their average use amounted to only 1.5 hours a week, the survey found — less time than most people spend doomscrolling on their phones in a single day. That’s striking, considering that execs tend to be far more enthusiastic about the tech compared to their underlings. Another recent survey, for example, found that 40 percent of rank-and-file white collar workers thought AI didn’t save them any time at work, while 98 percent of their bosses did.

These latest findings will continue to raise questions about AI’s economic impact, and in its promise to supercharge productivity in the workplace. In another recent survey, more than half of nearly 4,500 CEOs said their companies weren’t seeing a financial return from investing in AI. A notable MIT study rang alarm bells across the industry after findings that 95 percent of companies that incorporated AI experiencing no meaningful growth in revenue.

Why this is the case isn’t much of a mystery. Studies have found that AIs fail at completing remote work and other white collar tasks, and slow down rather than speed up human programmers because they frequently slip errors into their code. Meanwhile, a fresher avenue of research exploring AI’s effect on the workforce using it is already producing damning insights. The tech may actually be intensifying work and accelerating burn-out, one report found, and it’s also leading to employees producing low-quality “workslop” that their co-workers are forced to fix, bogging down workflows and leading to resentment, another found — leading the researchers to opine that its “most alarming cost may be interpersonal.”

Despite this, AI adoption has gone up since the start up of 2025, the new survey found, with the percentage of businesses using AI tech increasing from 61 percent in February-April 2025 to 71 percent in November 2025-January 2026.

Perhaps what AI brings to the table is tough to quantify from an economic standpoint. Decades ago, the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow correctly predicted that the advent of information technology wouldn’t lead to a measurable surge in productivity, and instead would lead to a slow in productivity growth. The phenomenon is now called the Solow paradox: though computers were obviously transformative, they didn’t immediately translate to economic gains.

But the business world, nonetheless, is clinging to the hope that the tech’s promises will be borne out in the long run. The surveyed executives are predicting that AI will boost productivity by 1.4 percent and output by 0.8 percent over the next three years — while also cutting down employment by 0.5 percent. Hard to say which part they’re excited about more.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-labor-andrew-yang">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Andrew Yang — millionaire entrepreneur, noted Ivy leaguer, and one-time presidential hopeful — has a grim warning for his fellow salaried professionals: AI is about to wipe “millions” of office jobs over the coming months.

In an essay published on his Substack and flagged by Business Insider, Yang explained what he calls the “great disemboweling of white-collar jobs” due to AI.

“Do you sit at a desk and look at a computer much of the day?” he challenged. “Take this very seriously.”

“This automation wave will kick millions of white-collar workers to the curb in the next 12-18 months,” Yang wrote. “As one company starts to streamline, all of their competitors will follow suit. It will become a competition because the stock market will reward you if you cut headcount and punish you if you don’t. As one investor put it, ‘sell anything that consists of people sitting at a desk looking at a computer.&#39;”

Yang predicts that mid-career office professionals will be among the first to go. Right now, there are around 70 million office workers in the United States, but “expect that number to be reduced substantially, by 20-50 percent in the next several years,” the entrepreneur warned.

Yang went so far as to urge anyone in mid-career management, particularly those who own homes in the affluent burbs of Silicon Valley or Westchester County, New York to put there house up for sale now, to avoid the mad scramble once the labor apocalypse hits. “It might not feel great being first, but you don’t want to be last,” Yang wrote.

Going on, Yang predicted that personal bankruptcies will “surge” as office workers struggle to find gainful employment to maintain their lifestyles. This, he says, will also come for service workers down-wind of office labor — those employed as drycleaners, hair stylists, and dog walkers.

The “great disemboweling” will likewise impact recent college grads — a section which is already suffering through a brutal hiring market in the US — according to Yang.

All of this will result in even greater unrest and angst as the wealth generated by the AI spending boom will largely go to the few CEOs and executives at the top of the food chain. “Imagine what people are going to think when we all feel like serfs to AI overlords that have soaked up the white-collar work?” Yang posits.

At the end of the day, Yang’s pronouncement reads like a lot of the other AI doomsaying out there, much of which comes, ironically, from the tech moguls themselves. Like those prophecies, Yang’s ends when it comes time to supply a constructive answer to the world-upending crisis beyond some vague idea of universal basic income.

“Expect it to get incredibly, intergenerationally rough out there,” Yang concluded. “Batten down the hatches, and do what you can for yourself and those around you.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2017, Elon Musk signed an open letter calling on the United Nations to ban the development of autonomous weapons.

“We do not have long to act,” the letter read. “Once this Pandora’s box is opened, it will be hard to close.”

In 2018, he signed a pledge by the Future of Life Institute, agreeing that “the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine” and that “we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.”

But the draw of big government contracts to do exactly what he opposed back then has seemingly become too lucrative to remain ethically consistent. As Bloomberg reports, SpaceX and xAI, the latter of which was recently folded into the former, are now competing in a Pentagon contest to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming tech.

Inside sources told Bloomberg that the Pentagon’s contest has a $100 million prize and was launched last month. The goal is to develop a drone swarm that can respond to voice commands simultaneously.

However, considering the current state of large language models, which continue to be plagued by hallucinations, it’s no wonder experts have voiced concerns about using generative AI to command lethal drones.

While coordinated movement of drones is already well-established tech, having a whole network of drones move autonomously at once in pursuit of a target has proven extremely difficult on the battlefield, per Bloomberg‘s sources.

The effort is part of the Trump administration’s Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG), and the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s arm dedicated to tapping Silicon Valley for cutting-edge tech.

The goal is to progressively develop the concept from software to real-life testing across five separate phases.

According to Bloomberg‘s sources, the drones won’t just be used for reconnaissance, implying they will also serve offensive purposes. The human-machine interaction “will directly impact the lethality and effectiveness of these systems.”

That’s a considerable departure for SpaceX, which has previously inked government contracts for access to space and military satellites, but not weapons systems.

Musk’s xAI signed a $200 million contract with the US military for the use of its Grok chatbot and has been looking to hire engineers with security clearance.

The news comes ahead of a rumored SpaceX IPO at a record-crushing valuation of $1.25 trillion. How investors will react to Musk reversing his stance on the use of autonomous weapons systems remains to be seen.

Musk claimed earlier this month that SpaceX would “form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” following the company’s merger with xAI.

The CEO, however, made no mention of his companies’ efforts to develop drone swarms.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As AI companies and startups push their way into the web browser market, the world’s biggest browser, Google Chrome, is rolling out a handful of new features. The company on Thursday announced the official launch of a trio of options, including Split View, PDF annotations, and a “Save to Google Drive” feature, designed to more deeply integrate Chrome with one of Google’s other online services.

While these particular additions aren’t focused on AI, Google already integrated its Gemini AI assistant into Chrome. The move was made in response to the increased competition from AI providers like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are dabbling in agentic browsers. These so-called browser wars have pushed Google to be less stagnant in terms of developing and releasing more consumer-facing features.

With Split View, multitasking in Chrome has become easier as the feature puts two pages side-by-side in the same tab. This lets you work across two webpages or watch a video while taking notes, among other things. To use the feature, you’ll drag a tab to the left or right edge of the browser window or right-click a link and select “Open Link in Split View.” The tabs will automatically snap into place. When no longer needed, you can exit the Split View layout via an option found via a right-click.

Another practical addition is the PDF annotations feature, which lets you add notes to a PDF or highlight its text from the browser. This means you don’t have to download the PDF and then open it in another application to work with its content. The option, a long time coming, could make it much simpler to do basic PDF tasks, like digitally signing a document, filling out a form, making notes within a file or personal document, and more.

Finally, the new Save to Google Drive feature will allow you to save any PDF directly to your Google Drive account, instead of your computer, where it may get lost. When using this feature, the saved files will appear in a “Saved from Chrome” folder in your Drive, making them easy to find.

Today’s update follows the expansion of Gemini and other agentic features to Chromebook users last month. And soon, Chrome is poised to adopt another change that was first spearheaded by its competitors: support for vertical tabs. (Tech-savvy users can even enable that option now, in an experimental phase, by changing a flag.)

This reimagined way to organize open tabs was one of the flagship features in The Browser Company’s first alternative browser, Arc, and is now found in its  AI browser, Dia. By adding this feature and the others, Google hopes to give Chrome users fewer reasons to switch.

            <h2>Reddit is testing a new AI search feature for shopping</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Reddit announced on Thursday that it’s testing a new AI search tool that takes community recommendations and matches them with products from some of the company’s shopping and advertising partners.

A small group of users in the U.S. will start to see search results that include interactive product carousels with pricing, images, and direct where-to-buy links.

The announcement reflects Reddit’s broader push to combine its community-driven platform with e-commerce capabilities. The move comes as Reddit launched its first shoppable ad product last year, called Dynamic Product Ads (DPA), which display personalized product recommendations to users based on their interests.

Now, when users who are part of the test search for something like “best noise-canceling headphones” or “electronic gift ideas for a college student,” they will see a carousel of related products at the bottom of the results.

This carousel will feature products directly mentioned by users from conversations on related posts and comments. If users tap on the product, they can view more details and then be directed to the retailer to purchase the item.

“This feature surfaces top-recommended products directly from discussions, giving redditors instant information about any product,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This test is designed to make Reddit easier to navigate while keeping community perspectives at the center of the experience. We’ll continue learning from how people use this new feature and refine the experience over time.”

While platforms like TikTok and Instagram have long integrated shopping features, Reddit is now looking to follow suit. Of course, Reddit isn’t the only tech platform that recently started exploring AI-driven shopping, as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rolled out an “Instant Checkout” feature last September that lets users make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations.

Thursday’s announcement comes after Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said during the company’s earnings release last week that the platforms’s AI search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business, not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver.

Huffman also noted that weekly active users for search grew 30% over the past year, increasing from 60 million to 80 million, while weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers feature rose from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is shutting down its standalone Messenger website, the company shared in a help page. Starting April 2026, the website will no longer be available. If users still want to send and receive messages on the web, they can do so while logged into Facebook.

“After messenger.com goes away, you will be automatically redirected to use facebook.com/messages for messaging on a computer,” the help page reads. “You can continue your conversations there or on the Messenger mobile app.”

If you use Messenger without a Facebook account, then you’ll only be able to continue your conversations on the Messenger mobile app. Users can restore their chat history on any platform using the PIN they entered when they first created a backup on Messenger. If you can’t remember your PIN, you can reset it.

The move comes a few months after Meta shut down Messenger’s stand-alone desktop apps for Windows and Mac. The writing may have been on the wall at the time, as Meta had been redirecting existing desktop app users to the Facebook website to continue using the messaging service, rather than the Messenger website.

The change was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi. Meta is notifying users of the update via a pop-up message on the Messenger website and app.

Users have taken to social media to express their frustration with the update, with many saying they don’t want to rely on the Facebook website to send and receive Messenger chats on the web, especially those who have deactivated their Facebook accounts.

While Meta’s decision to shut down various Messenger platforms is frustrating for users, it allows the tech giant to reduce costs by leaving it with fewer platforms to maintain.

Messenger first launched as “Facebook Chat” back in 2008, and Facebook (now Meta) launched Facebook Messenger as a standalone app in 2011. Over the years, the tech giant positioned Messenger as its own service outside of Facebook, and in 2014, the social network removed messaging capabilities from its main mobile app to push people to the Messenger app. However, the company reversed this in 2023 when it began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app.

Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/new-york-hits-the-brakes-on-robotaxi-expansion-plan/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo’s big chance to bring its robotaxis to the state of New York has been thwarted — for now.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled.

“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was the first to report the proposal had been removed.

The withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.

“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch.

“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”

“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.

Hochul had introduced, as part of her broader budget proposal, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.

Even if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.

With that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.

Waymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31.

New York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.

Waymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of the year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in court on Wednesday in a landmark trial aiming to determine if the tech giant’s social media applications are addictive and harmful to teens and kids. The trial, taking place in L.A. Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s own research indicated that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.

Lawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier Congressional hearing that this was not the case, the AP noted, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase users’ time spent in app by 12%.

Zuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One Meta document from 2018 stated that, as of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.

Here, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its own age assurance tools for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where many states have now created or are developing their own social media laws.)

Reports from the courtroom noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were taking things out of context or mischaracterizing what documents said.

Plaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. TikTok and Snap settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success.

During the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault.

            <div id="article-text">SoftBank subsidiary SB Energy is expected to build a massive 9.2 gigawatt natural gas-fired power plant on the Ohio-Kentucky border, according to a report from Bloomberg. If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.

With a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.

The Japanese investor is a partner in the Stargate project with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are in the process of building a “proof of concept” data center at GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant.

A power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to our calculations based on public, energy-use metrics. When including methane leaks from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could even be even bigger.

This week brought another round in President Trump’s war against Black history. A federal judge rebuked his administration for removing panels that mentioned “the dirty business of slavery” from the President’s House in Philadelphia, where George Washington lived. (Among other inconvenient facts, the ruling reminded the public that the nation’s first president rotated his slaves between his homes to duck state emancipation laws.) Judge Cynthia Rufe opened her ruling with a quote from George Orwell, and wrote that an agency “cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership.” All in all, a robust defense of accuracy. But the administration is still fighting the facts of Black history on many fronts.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to our staff writer Clint Smith, the author of How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America, about what’s unprecedented in this administration’s approach to whitewashing history. The Atlantic staffer Adam Harris makes the case for a different approach to Black History Month. They both also talk about the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, who died this week.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Over the many years of raising kids in D.C. public schools, I’ve experienced Black History Month the way many Americans do. I’ve helped my kids make poster boards, and as they got older, PowerPoints, celebrating the achievements of many famous Black Americans: Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks.

Black History Month celebrations tend to follow what The Atlantic’s Adam Harris calls a “formula.” But this year might call for something more radical.

President Donald Trump: (Applause.) And our country will be woke no longer. (Cheers and applause.)

Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Here is a missive from the president that typifies his attitude about Black history: “The Smithsonian is,” all caps, “OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he posted over the summer.

The president has restored Confederate names to Army bases, and removed lessons and images about slavery from federally funded institutions.

News anchor (from CBS Philadelphia): Well, the fight to restore a slavery exhibit in Philadelphia, it is ramping up after it was dismantled last week—

Rosin: Just this week, a federal judge ordered the administration to restore panels at what’s known as the President’s House in Philadelphia that discussed The Dirty Business of Slavery.

The federal judge wrote, “An agency … cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership.”

Today, we talk to two of my Atlantic colleagues: writer and podcast host Adam Harris and staff writer Clint Smith, who’s also the author of How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America.

Adam Harris: Thanks so much for having me.

Rosin: So, Clint, as someone who has studied the presentation of history, and specifically Black history, how would you characterize this administration’s approach?

Smith: Antagonistic. I think we are witnessing an administration working with an unsettling intensity to attempt to distort, erase, manipulate the history of this country and, within that, manipulate the history of Black Americans’ role, contributions, and experiences in America. And what I mean by that is—let’s take slavery, for example. The president of the United States said that the Smithsonian [Institution], for example, spends too much time talking about “how bad Slavery was.”

My sense of things is that it is not the case that this administration believes slavery didn’t happen or not even that they believe that slavery wasn’t bad. I think they understand that it was bad, but what happens is, if you talk honestly about the horror and the brutality and the cruelty of what slavery was, you then have to talk about how the residue of that system continues to inform the contemporary landscape of inequality today.

And I think it would fundamentally reorient people’s relationship to not only the history of this country, but the contemporary reality of this country. And that’s something that I think that so many folks in this administration want to avoid because they want to be able to tell themselves that the America that they believe to be true, the America that exists today, is one that is the result singularly of people’s hard work or deservedness when there’s obviously another story to be told there.

Rosin: And what is that desire about? ’Cause, Adam, [President Donald] Trump talks about wanting monuments to be “uplifting,” not to cause people “shame.” What does that mean?

Harris: So when you think about the idea of uplifting, it’s sort of this notion of celebrating the positives of someone’s character, so as to say, George Washington was the founder of the nation and led the Revolution, was one of the greatest men of his time, and if you do that and you sort of say this clean history of George Washington without the additional stories, the fact that George Washington rotated his enslaved workers from Philadelphia to Mount Vernon in Virginia so that they would not earn their liberty under Pennsylvania law, because after six months, you started to get your freedom. And so if you start to add to that complicating narrative, it doesn’t paint this sort of clean image of our leaders.

Rosin: And that just feels bad? What’s the—

Harris: So there are a couple of things that that does. When you start to question one of the decisions, it also makes you question the other things—if you start to say, Well, this person that we’ve painted as someone who did an unqualified good did, also, unqualified bads.

Smith: And I think the other part of this, too, is that if you have to tell a new story about Washington and you begin to tell a new story about [Thomas] Jefferson that includes the sort of unsavory, so to speak, parts of their legacy, which is to say the more honest parts of their legacy—if you have to tell a new story about these men, it also means you have to tell a new story about America’s founding. If you have to tell a new story about America’s founding, it means you have to tell a new story about this country. And for many Americans, if you have to tell a new story about America, it means you have to tell a new story about yourself.

Smith: And that taps into something that is existential, that serves as a catalyst to a fundamental crisis of identity, because who people believe they are is consciously, and subconsciously, tied to a story of America that they have been told over the course of generations—through school, through family, through community. And when you untether them from that notion of reality that they’ve come to believe, it’s incredibly jarring.

Rosin: Yeah, I can see. It’s disorienting. I feel like we need to ground this conversation in a few examples. You started by using the word intensity. Of the things that the Trump administration has done, which one has stuck out to you? Just give us a few examples.

Harris: Yeah, there are a handful. It’s the renaming of Confederate memorials and Confederate monuments. It is the U.S. Naval Academy removing books from their library. It’s the Air Force Academy stripping back the teaching of the Tuskegee Airmen.

And actually, one of the things that Clint was saying about people having to reassess their own legacies, I remember we had a conversation about his book, where he was saying, If you are having to ask questions about the ways that your grandparents—the people who took you fishing, and the people who you sat on their laps and they read books to you when you were younger, and you have all of these great memories of them—if you have to reassess how they got to do the things that they got to do, then it really does jar you and makes you fundamentally reassess your own sort of standing in the world.

And so this sort of broader project of saying, Well, if we pare back some of the things that the Tuskegee Airmen had to do to become the Tuskegee Airmen—Black History Month sort of calls us to remember that these great people did great things, but the question is: Why did they have to do those great things? Why did Jackie Robinson have to integrate baseball? Why did Martin Luther King have to deliver his speech at the March on Washington? It is because the nation did not have this clean story of progress.

Rosin: Clint, I’m curious to put this in some kind of context, what the Trump administration is doing now, which you described as having a certain degree of intensity, versus previous eras in American history versus Trump 1, because there’s always a push and pull. I imagine countries rarely do just clean memorialization of their sins.

Smith: Yeah. What’s interesting is that this is the pushback against Black progress, Black history. That, in and of itself, is not new. What scholars of Black history and historians talk about all the time is that in moments in which there are periods of Black social, political, and economic progress, there is often pushback to that progress.

So after the Civil War and after Reconstruction, there was obviously an intense sort of pushback to the progress that was made following the Civil War through Reconstruction. Then, after the civil-rights movement, there was an intense pushback. And what we’re seeing now is a pushback to much of the era both of Barack Obama’s presidency, but then later, the Black Lives Matter movement, which sort of intensified following the murder of George Floyd.

But what it is important to note—that even while we are experiencing the echoes of this history and we’re experiencing this sort of nature of the sort of cyclical elements that are there, this also is a pretty unique iteration of it in the way that it is state sanctioned. In the context of the civil-rights movement, there was intense pushback—or even during the civil-rights movement, so much of the pushback, it would come from states and it would come from extrajudicial forces, but what the civil-rights leaders were appealing to was the federal government to come and protect them.

Rosin: Ah, that is so important. I get that. So what you’re saying is, mostly, the pushback is cultural—it’s cultural; it comes from state governments. But this is completely top-down.

Smith: Oftentimes, yeah. I don’t think that we have seen a level of antagonism from the federal government, who, historically, the federal government or the Supreme Court, in the context of the Warren Court, have been the thing that allowed Black folks to have some sort of support outside of the context of their specific geographic and political reality in a certain state or in a certain community. And that now is gone. There is no federal government to appeal to. In fact, the federal government is the antagonist.

Rosin: After the break: Is it time to start practicing Black History Month differently?

Rosin: So given everything you both have said, which is, we’re in this unusual position where the federal government is a major actor in, what do we wanna call it, distorting, whitewashing history?

Rosin: —any of those? It’s Black History Month, which is this month. In this year, in this moment, is there an argument for thinking of or practicing Black History Month differently?

Smith: I’ve been thinking a lot about this. I was recently in New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and I bring my kids. I’m from New Orleans; that’s my hometown. My parents still live there—

I bring my kids often to New Orleans ’cause it’s a place that means a lot to me and I want them to have a connection to that city. And one of the things that we did, kind of between the celebrations and the festivals and the parades, is we got in the car with my mom and went to her elementary school, which is no longer there; it’s a school that was called T. J. Semmes.

And we went there because my mom was among the first Black students to desegregate that school, or to integrate that school. She was there after—there were the four little girls, including Ruby Bridges, who integrated New Orleans schools in 1960. And I brought my kids there with my mom in this moment because I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means for people to understand Black history not only as something about Rosa Parks and Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King, but also as this thing that’s the people who are right next to us. Their grandmother—not Martin Luther King, not Rosa Parks, not these people in the books—their grandmother was among the first wave of students to integrate a school in New Orleans.

And I want them both to understand that because of their proximity to it, but also, in this specific moment, I think it’s a reminder that the Trump administration can try to change a museum. They can try to change how things are taught in school. They can try to take away DEI in higher ed. They can try to do all of these things. But we still, within the sort of microunits of families and communities, still have the power to share this history in ways that I think can be really meaningful for all of us and for young people. And it wasn’t just for my kids; I got to hear my mom talk about her experience going into this school.

And I think all of these things, for me, when I think of Black History Month, it’s about both understanding and appreciating the sort of Jackie Robinsons and the like, but it’s also about remembering that those larger figures are only possible because of what’s happening on the most granular level.

Harris: And actually, to that point, it is to say that it’s the actions of each individual. You think historically, it’s like, oh, well, Frederick Douglass actually didn’t have to write those things that he wrote, and they praised him because it was like, Oh, that was a really brave thing of you to do. Our grandparents didn’t have to send our moms and dads to the schools that they sent them to. A lot of people didn’t, where it’s like, Actually, it’s a little bit too dangerous to do that. And similarly, my mom was born in 1963 in Alabama, where four little girls were killed in a church, the sanctuary, the place where you’re supposed to feel safest. This is living history that individuals experience and continue to experience, and it’s the individual actions that people take.

Rosin: And why is it important to remember history in its difficulty? Even within families, people keep secrets for decades and decades, and they don’t like to talk about the bad things that happen. It’s a common human impulse. So why is it important to remember something like what your mother went through?

Smith: I tell people all the time: America is a place that has provided unparalleled, unimaginable opportunities for millions of people across generations in ways that their own ancestors could have never imagined. It has also done so at the direct expense of millions and millions of other people. And both of those things are the story of America—it’s not one over here and one over there; you get to pick this one and not pick that one. Both of those things are the story of this country, and you have to hold both of those realities alongside one another.

Smith: Well, I think when we think of ourselves, when I think of who I am as a person, I’m someone who’s done things in my life that I’m proud of, and I’m someone who’s done things in my life that I’m not proud of, because I’m human and I make mistakes. And what I try to do and what I try to teach my children is, you acknowledge those mistakes; you try to learn from those mistakes to become a better version of yourself in the future. And so if that’s the standard that I hold myself to, the standard I hold my children to, the standard I hold my friends and loved ones to, why would I not hold my country to that same standard?

And I think the implications for it are that if you don’t—I remember being a kid growing up in the ’90s in New Orleans and being inundated with these messages about all the things that were wrong with Black people, that the reason there was so much violence and poverty and inequality in the Black community was because of something that Black people had done or had failed to do. And it was coming from the media. It was coming from politicians. It was coming from celebrities. It was coming from everywhere.

And I remember this feeling of hearing these messages and not having the historical context or intellectual tool kit with which to push back against it, and what I felt and experienced as a child was a sort of paralysis. It was like an emotional paralysis, where I knew what I was hearing was wrong, but I didn’t know how to say it was wrong. I didn’t have that language. And it wasn’t until years later, when I encountered the scholarship, and I encountered the art, and I encountered the film and I encountered the history that explained that, oh, the reason one part of New Orleans looks one way and another part of New Orleans looks another way is not ’cause of the people in those communities. It’s because of what has been done to those communities or what’s been extracted from those communities generation after generation after generation. And when you learn that history, it is so profoundly freeing and so profoundly liberating because this country can’t lie to you anymore.

Rosin: Adam, this week, there was a pushback against this trend we’re describing from a federal judge who ruled about the panels at what’s known as the President’s House in Philadelphia that were taken down. It was quite a strong ruling. She quoted [George] Orwell. She said “An agency … cannot arbitrarily decide what is true.” How significant is that ruling? Have you seen other kinds of pushback like that?

Harris: We have seen federal judges push back pretty forcefully against the Trump administration’s dictates, their executive orders, and maneuvers that they’ve made, whether that is removing the placards without consulting the city in an effort to sort of say that the history that they want to say is a true history. The order functionally says it can’t just hinge on whether there’s the transfer of power, what we actually believe about what we’re saying. It is a very Orwellian view of the way we do history.

Americans, people generally, think of history in a different way than scholars think of history, where, yes, there are places and dates and names, but how those things are remembered is sort of subject to your interpretation, oftentimes. But there are realities. The fact that George Washington transported people back and forth and wrote to other people to say that, Hey, how can I get around this law that says that I can’t keep people here for longer than this period of time?, those are just realities. You cannot change the facts of the situation. You can only change how you remember those facts and if you decide to publicly display those facts. And in a sense, what we have seen over the last year and change, in a really aggressive fashion, is that effort to remove those public memories of the facts that happen in this country.

Rosin: Although that conversation about facts does often confuse me a little bit. What we do do is decide which facts we’re gonna present, which is what the Trump administration is saying: Why do we have to put those on display?

Smith: I think it goes back to what we were saying before. I was a high-school teacher, and so I feel very strongly about the idea that the Trump administration would suggest that part of why you shouldn’t teach so much about Washington owning slaves or Jefferson owning enslaved people or why the presidential house should remove these things is, they would say, because they don’t want so much emphasis on it. And they would say that teachers and museums are attempting to indoctrinate students—they use the language of indoctrination.

And what I find to be true is that there is this attempt to conflate, or to make it so that the teaching of empiricism, of primary-source realities, to suggest that that is somehow an ideological project rather than an empirical one. What I tried to do when I was a teacher and what I try to do as someone who writes about history is not necessarily to convince the reader to believe X or believe Y, but it is to lay out all of it.

I’m actually not interested in if you think Thomas Jefferson was evil or good. What I do want you to do is sit with the fact that he both wrote the Declaration of Independence and he also wrote in Notes on the State of Virginia that Black people are inferior to whites in both endowments of body and mind. What I want you to do is to sit with the fact that he wrote that “all men are created equal” and that he enslaved 600 people, including four of his own children. My role is not to tell you what to think, but what I do have to do is present the evidence. What a teacher does have to do is present the evidence. What a museum does have to do is present the evidence, to say, This is the totality. This is the full picture.

My understanding is that the presidential house doesn’t say anywhere, George Washington was an evil man. George Washington was bad. What it says is that George Washington did X, Y, Z in the context of founding America, that he stepped down after two terms, etc., etc. And also says, And there’s this other part of him: that he owned a plantation in Mount Vernon; that, as Adam said, he brought his slaves back and forth to avoid having to emancipate them. And what we, as Americans, have to do is to sit with all of that.

Rosin: As you both know, this week, Jesse Jackson died. Did you find yourself thinking differently about him as we start to hear his voice on the radio this week? ’Cause I imagine, like most people, you just haven’t thought about him in a minute.

Smith: The thing that I thought about more than anything after I heard about his passing—we’ve been talking about what it means to have these conversations with your children and to attempt to ensure that they understand their proximity to Black history. When I told my daughter, who just turned 7, about how Jesse Jackson was with Martin Luther King when Martin Luther King was killed, it blew her mind ’cause in her mind, Martin Luther King is this guy from a long, long time ago. Like, Martin Luther King and Jesus were around at the same time.

Smith: To watch her little eyes be like, Oh, there was a person who was alive until just now who was with Martin Luther King, who worked with him, who was an adult with Martin Luther King when he was killed, what it did, I think, was, again, helped remind her that this history that many people say was a long time ago just, in fact, wasn’t that long ago at all.

Rosin: Yeah, I was surprised in my reaction to the “I Am Somebody” speech, which I heard when I was in college. He came to my college campus. He spoke to us.

Rosin: And I realized it settled in my memory almost like a song, like a rhythm: I am somebody. But just listening to the words—I am poor, I am unemployed, I am in prison—

Rosin: —and I am somebody—I was really moved by it. I actually listened to what he was saying, I think, probably for the first time.

Harris: Yeah. It’s this idea that history isn’t so far away, that we are not living outside of history, that we really are living inside of history, and that his passing really signals that that truth continues, and it becomes incumbent on that next generation to pick up the mantle of carrying that truth forward.

Jackson: I’ve sought to make America better. And how do you make America better? By challenging America to be better—and to be good.

Jackson: It’s dark, my friends. But don’t surrender. The morning comes. I know it’s dark, but the morning comes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The life of a globe-trotting environmentalist is a breeding ground for moral quandaries. My oldest friend happens to be one such climate advocate; for several years, he ran a nonprofit encouraging carbon capture in the European Union. When it comes time to attend a lecture or a summit abroad, he avoids flying if he can. If not, he flies economy—the least carbon-intensive option—and swats aside a vague feeling that he is “getting away with something.” Even though his work could help save the planet, he is forever calculating each mote of carbon that enters the atmosphere as a result of his personal choices: what to eat, where to travel, what to keep or throw away. He feels, in a word, responsible.

This is no accident. For decades, industries hoping to avoid regulation have reminded us about our personal culpability for social problems. Think of the famous 1971 “Crying Indian” ad, in which a Native American man sheds a tear over a piece of litter—a PSA that was sponsored by packaging companies. Or the concept of a personal carbon footprint, which was popularized in the early 2000s by one of the world’s largest oil companies, BP. A few years after that, behavioral economists began repurposing these tactics for benevolent purposes, using subtle psychological cues called “nudges” to encourage people to file their taxes, save for retirement, exercise, and vote. Over the next decade and a half, political leaders enthusiastically embraced the idea, adopting behavioral-science solutions to far-reaching public-policy problems.

Let’s say you’d like to encourage everyone to recycle as diligently as my friend does. Instead of instituting an onerous, possibly unpopular mandate, you could nudge. You could, as officials did in the United Kingdom, put up posters of watching eyes to promote good behavior. Or you could copy the authorities in Copenhagen and paint the sidewalk with footprints leading to trash bins. The problem that emerged with this approach, which is neatly summarized by George Loewenstein and Nick Chater in their new book, It’s on You, is that, in retrospect, a focus on personal responsibility in this situation was “misplaced.” “The prevalence of plastics, and plastic waste, has not been caused by individual careless consumers,” they write. “It has been caused by the relentless growth of the plastics industry.”

When nudges like these work, the benefits are minor. Meanwhile, and much worse, they shift focus away from truly effective changes—in this case, a limit on the production of single-use plastics—by convincing individuals that they are at fault. In the long term, this failure to address deep social problems contributes to the erosion of people’s trust in governments and institutions, breeding nihilism and an attraction to demagogues who claim to have easy answers.

Loewenstein is widely credited with co-founding the field of behavioral economics, and both he and Chater, a U.K.-based behavioral scientist and consultant, contributed to nudge-policy making and research. This book is in part their mea culpa. It’s also a convincing argument that grounding the collective good in personal choices can be corrosive, especially in a deeply individualistic culture. Like my friend the environmentalist, many of us are left to wonder: How can we function in a society that betrays our natural concern for the world around us?

Like most would-be revolutions, the nudge was launched with a manifesto. “Better governance often requires less in the way of government coercion and more in the way of freedom to choose,” the law professor Cass R. Sunstein and the economist Richard H. Thaler wrote in their 2008 best seller, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The book sold more than 2 million copies and became a sensation in policy circles. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron created dedicated teams often referred to as “nudge units” within their administrations. Sunstein joined the federal government as Obama’s regulatory czar. The appeal to politicians was obvious: They could engineer a better society without having to build consensus for more taxes, regulations, bans, and mandates. Sunstein and Thaler called this approach “libertarian paternalism,” which promised to resolve a central conflict in civics by, in effect, sidestepping it.

Loewenstein and Chater met on the U.K.’s nudge unit in 2013. “It is hard now to recapture the sense of possibility that was in the air as the new behavioral approach to solving society’s, and the world’s, problems began to gain ground,” they write. In the years that followed, their enthusiasm faded to skepticism as some of the most touted nudges proved less effective, or less durable, than advertised.

One such nudge is to “default” people into responsible choices, which exploits their natural bias for the status quo. A 2024 paper co-authored by the economist David Laibson tracked several American companies that auto-enrolled employees into sensible retirement plans with a standard minimum contribution. This worked—for a time. Because sticking with the plan was optional, many workers withdrew their money early, which mostly erased any long-term gains. Laibson and his collaborators found that workers saved less than 1 percent more of their income. By contrast, Australia signs up all earners for a retirement plan at a 12 percent contribution and doesn’t let them withdraw funds before age 55. The country’s retirement savings are more than 150 percent of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world.

Examples of inadequate nudges abound. In the fight against obesity, a well-known intervention is to pay people for losing weight. This does show meaningful effects—as long as they’re being paid. When payment stops, they gain the weight back. As the authors note, a more lasting solution would be to place limits on fat and sugar in ultra-processed food, which makes up more than half of the average person’s calorie consumption.

Chater and Loewenstein refer to these competing policy approaches—the individual and the systemic—as the “i-frame” and the “s-frame.” When we focus on i-frame nudges, they argue, we drain momentum from more effective s-frame solutions. Take paying taxes, a monumentally complex and frustrating endeavor for the average person: The IRS could just calculate your return and send you a check or a bill, as other countries’ tax authorities do. But the tax lobby has consistently blocked this, promoting individual choice to protect the billions of dollars that it earns each year in tax-preparation fees. This kind of misdirection creates a “crowding out” effect: Experiments by Loewenstein and his colleagues have shown that, after people are nudged to conserve energy, they become less likely to support a more systemic solution such as a carbon tax.

Using human flaws to manipulate people into doing the wrong thing seems much easier than getting them to do the right one, especially when the negative forces are global corporations funding multibillion-dollar marketing campaigns, and the positive forces are enlightened bureaucrats sending small experimental signals. Chater and Loewenstein believe that the government nudgers are not malevolent, but misguided. But by participating in the past half century’s slide into hyper-individualism, libertarian paternalists are contributing to a collective ungluing. To understand the consequences of this “one weird trick” model of ordering a society, just look at the current state of America’s institutions, which are being torn down by a public convinced that nothing works.

The authors of It’s on You mention the present-day social and political consequences of nudge policies, including the hunger for reform that populists such as Donald Trump have seized on and sometimes betrayed—but they don’t really spell them out. The book ends with a series of prescriptions for “unrigging” the rules of democracy and the economy, many of which sound familiar: take money out of politics, close the revolving door between government and industry, hold Big Tech accountable for online abuses. Thaler, the Nudge co-author, objected in a 2023 paper that such “nanny state” initiatives are unrealistic. But if the spotty record of nudges has proved anything, it’s that half measures won’t solve our deepest problems. “The history of democratic politics across the world is, after all, one of continual and often convulsive struggle to wrest control of the political and legal processes from the few to the many,” Chater and Loewenstein write.

But what if the problem is not only structural but also cultural? I suspect that the authors would largely agree that nudges didn’t make American society pathologically individualistic and atomized; instead, nudging was a well-meaning but inadequate attempt to circumvent a mindset that is already baked in. The depth of this predicament was apparent during the coronavirus pandemic, when social media abounded with declarations of resistance such as that of the retired baseball player Aubrey Huff, who stated that he “would rather die” than wear a mask. You might say that the United States has—as the behavioral economists might put it—its own cognitive bias. You could call it the cowboy effect.

At times, that bias has dragged us down; in other moments, it has helped us achieve a collective good. Large social changes built around appeals to personal freedom, such as the legalization of gay marriage, seemed impossible until a substantial proportion of the public showed visible support for them, and then they started happening all at once. Today’s progressive populists, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have gained some limited traction in portraying the government as a protector of individual freedom against corporate power, much as President Franklin D. Roosevelt sold his New Deal policies as a shield against the “economic tyranny” of that era’s oligarchs.

Which brings me back to my friend the environmentalist. He knows all about the manipulative history of the nudge, including the packaging-company PSA and the carbon footprint, yet he still feels a personal obligation that goes beyond his work in the s-frame. With a lot of thought, he has learned to recontextualize the sense of responsibility. Now when he carefully chooses to stay home rather than fly, or when he eats veggies instead of pork, he imagines not a one-man fix to the climate crisis but a quiet demonstration of a new social norm, which one day might force politicians to act—if not through the recycling bin, then through the ballot box. After all, there is a way to harness the collective effort of individuals to bring about desperately needed change. It’s called a government.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">America loves its heroes. The nation has made lions of the men who signed a document 250 years ago to declare independence from the English crown; it’s made saints of the 55 men who gathered in a sweaty room in Philadelphia to draft its Constitution. Time elevates those people and their deeds to the heights of deities, and American gods must be faultless. But those heroes are not gods; they were, indeed, men—fallible as all others.

In the same city where the Founders wrote the words that have guided the nation for more than two centuries, George Washington—the most esteemed of them—made a home as America’s first president. He brought men and women he had enslaved with him, and rotated them between Philadelphia and Mount Vernon, in Virginia, so that they would not earn their liberty under Pennsylvania law. He shuffled them back and forth so that they would remain his property. These facts cannot be changed; only how they are remembered can.

For 16 years, an exhibit at Washington’s Philadelphia home, “The President’s House: Freedom and Slavery in the Making of a New Nation”—situated in the shadow of the Liberty Bell’s unambiguous nod to freedom’s ring—highlighted that difficult history. But in late January, a cadre of federal workers yanked placards from the site’s brick walls in response to a March 2025 executive order from the White House that shunned complication. In the order, President Trump had charged the secretary of the interior with ensuring that public monuments “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”

Clint Smith: What it means to tell the truth about America

Black History Month is sometimes treated as little more than an opportunity for corporate branding and, maybe, school assemblies; but in the face of such erasure, observing it this February feels radical. Black history in America is, of course, more than the story of enslavement and what was done to Black people on this continent across hundreds of years. It is a story of family, love, resilience, determination, achievement, and, yes, despair, wrapped into one package—what Black Americans achieved in spite of the fact that, for many years, they were not seen as fully Americans. It is not a simple history and it is not a story of unrelenting progress, because America’s history is neither of those things. To acknowledge the troubling, shameful aspects of American history is not to denigrate the Founders but to see them, and the others who made their livelihoods possible, as people. Black History Month calls on us to remember their humanity, and to remember the heroic and human deeds of those who have always been unsung.

This is a milestone year for America. It marks both the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the 100th anniversary of an effort to recover and recount the contributions of Black Americans left out of the national narrative—what was launched in 1926 as Negro History Week and then became Black History Month in 1976. One anniversary honors the nation’s founding ideals; the other reckons with its failures to live up to them. Both offer an essential—and timely—opportunity to acknowledge the ambitions and shortcomings of America’s grand and unfinished experiment.

The majority of Americans experience Black History Month as a formula. Students prepare PowerPoint or posterboard projects about people such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, or Jackie Robinson—or, for those who would venture further in our history, Phillis Wheatley, the nation’s first published Black poet. Businesses invite speakers and hold events for staff. Civic associations host dinners.

That is not how Black History Month began, though. Its precursor was established by Carter G. Woodson, the historian and founder of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, at a time when eugenics—race science and the idea that white people were genetically superior to Black people—was finally being challenged as the pseudoscience it is. “The greatest scholars of today are saying that there is no such thing as race in science, and that there is nothing in anthropology or psychology to support such myths as the inferiority and superiority of races,” the 1927 announcement for Negro History Week reads. “These truths, however, will have little bearing on the uplift of the negro if they are left in the state of academic discussion.” From its inception, the event was designed to be a chance to tell the truth about the past in public—the whole truth.

In 1976, Negro History Week became Black History Month, and was officially acknowledged by President Gerald Ford. The nation, founded on “individual rights,” was turning 200—but Black Americans had only just had their right to vote reinforced by law. Every president since then has issued a proclamation to celebrate Black History Month. Freedom is a struggle, Ronald Reagan’s proclamation said in 1986, echoing Frederick Douglass’s exhortation that if there is no struggle, there is no progress. “The American experience and character can never be fully grasped until the knowledge of black history assumes its rightful place in our schools and our scholarship,” Reagan wrote.

Vann R. Newkirk II: American democracy is only 55 years old–and hanging by a thread

On February 3, President Trump continued that tradition, and signed a proclamation of his own for Black History Month. “From the very beginning, our country has been blessed with countless black American heroes,” he stated, before lambasting people who have “needlessly divided” the public over race. “As President, I proclaim that ‘black history’ is not distinct from American history—rather, the history of Black Americans is an indispensable chapter in our grand American story.”

But what his administration is doing belies whatever nice words Trump had to say about Black heroes. Its actions to limit what aspects of Black history can be included in the American story betray Trump’s real meaning. His administration has renamed monuments for Confederate traitors, scrubbed memorials to the contributions of Black military service members, and purged writings by authors such as Maya Angelou from the U.S. Naval Academy library; this is an ongoing project.

Other politicians have made a concerted effort to curtail examinations of American history over the past several years. State lawmakers have limited what can be taught in public schools. Florida passed a law that warns teachers not to “persuade students to a particular point of view,” and blocked an Advanced Placement curriculum for African American studies. Oklahoma barred “discriminatory principles,” such as the idea that people bear responsibility for what someone of their race did in the past; teachers at one school said they were told to stop saying “Black excellence” to motivate their students. The Trump administration’s executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have created confusion and a climate of fear—not least because administration officials have been vague about what punishments districts, universities, and nonprofits might face for running afoul of their ideological standards and about what would even constitute a violation.

That haze has led to a drawback of even the most anodyne of celebrations honoring Black achievement. Last month, Indiana University at Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Dinner—held, without fail, every year since 1969—citing budget cuts. As a joint production of the university and its Black Student Union, the dinner was a marquee event in town. But halfway through 2025, IU closed its DEI office. State law had mandated that it shut down all DEI-adjacent programs, which meant the Black Student Union would lose a portion of its funding—funding that would have helped support the dinner.

On January 13, in response to a community outcry, the chancellor, Latha Ramchand, said the university was trying to “reimagine” its “affinity dinners” and other such events. “In short, the MLK Dinner is not going away—rather we are in a moment of transition and the work of this task force will help us create its next iteration.” But traditions gain salience through time and repetition. When they are interrupted, when we stop choosing them consistently, they lose their heft.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

At its most elemental, Black History Month is about seeing the nation in full. It invites complexity. Booker T. Washington, who created the Tuskegee Institute and built it into an academic juggernaut for Black students, was the most powerful Black man of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even his critics were forced to confess as much and admire his brilliance. Acknowledging his greatness does not mean forgetting that his philosophy would have allowed—at least in the short term—the continuation of Black Americans’ second-class citizenship. “In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers,” he told a predominantly white audience at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895, “yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”

Trump is correct that the United States is one nation with a shared history—people, places, dates, and events. But that history has been experienced differently by different people. It is a nation of the enslaved and the enslaver. It is also a nation built on principles. And one feels bad about telling the true legacy of the slaveholder only if one identifies, in some way, with his actions rather than his nobler ideals. To recognize the divide between someone’s stated values and their actions is to recognize where they should have done better and where we can still do better.

On Monday, citing George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, a federal judge ordered the administration to restore the placards at Washington’s old home in Philadelphia. History could not be erased. “The government here likewise asserts truth is no longer self-evident, but rather the property of the elected chief magistrate and his appointees and delegees,” Judge Cynthia Rufe, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote. “An agency, whether the Department of the Interior, NPS, or any other agency, cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership, regardless of the evidence before it.”

A day later, Jesse Jackson died at the age of 84. The civil-rights leader’s two upstart presidential campaigns revealed how limited America’s political imagination was at the time; his platform would become the foundation of the progressive movement for the next three decades. Sometimes I look at black-and-white photos of Jackson—playing basketball with Marvin Gaye, standing next to King on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis before he was murdered, or preparing to deliver the first joint address by a Black man to the Alabama legislature since Reconstruction. It’s easy to think of Jackson in the past. But he was also human, and lived until it was no longer this world but his friend John Lewis that he would see in the morning.

In 2019, members of Congress were preparing to discuss H.R. 40, a bill that would study reparations for slavery—a bill to atone for history. I spoke with Jackson ahead of the hearing. We talked about racism, reparations, and ultimately about hope. It felt natural to wonder where someone who had seen so much bad in U.S. history continued to draw his resolve from. Jackson told me that his own hope stemmed from the fact that the truth cannot be erased. “The truth of slavery—that Africans subsidized America’s wealth—that truth will not go away,” he said. History must be remembered. His death is a reminder that the duty to contend with that history falls to those who are still on this Earth.</div>

            <h2>Hitler’s Greenland Obsession</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/hitler-greenland/685984/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greenland appears to have been a lifelong preoccupation of Adolf Hitler’s. According to stenographic notes from a lunchtime conversation dated May 21, 1942, Hitler recalled that hardly anyone “interested him more in his youth” than Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer who in 1888 led the first team to cross Greenland’s interior. A surviving volume from Hitler’s private book collection contains firsthand accounts of the geologic and Arctic explorer Alfred Wegener’s Grönland Expedition, which left Wegener dead in 1930 and inspired the 1933 adventure film S.O.S. Eisberg, starring the actor and eventual filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.

Hitler’s personal copy of History of the Expedition, the narrative of the tragic Wegener venture, can be perused in the rare-book collection at the Library of Congress among the 1,200 or so remnant volumes from Hitler’s private library. The 198-page monograph bears his personal bookplate—ex libris, eagle, swastika—like many of the others, but is notable because unlike most, it does not include a handwritten inscription by an author, a close associate, or a distant admirer. This suggests that the volume was a personal acquisition rather than a gift, a fact made all the more interesting by the 1933 publication date, the first year of the Hitler chancellorship, when the Nazi leader’s interest in Greenland transitioned from personal to strategic.

From the May 2003 issue: Hitler’s forgotten library

By April 1934, Hitler’s government had inventoried Greenland: 13,500 Eskimo, 3,500 Danes, and 8,000 sheep, as well as the world’s largest deposit of a strategic natural resource—cryolite, a mineral essential to American aluminum production. In 1938, Hermann Göring dispatched an expedition to Greenland, ostensibly to explore the island’s flora and fauna. However, Hitler’s true intent may have been not scientific, but economic—the expedition was headed by a mining engineer, Kurt Herdemerten, who had been a member of the ill-fated Wegener expedition. Hitler had inflicted countless economic wounds on his country over his five years as chancellor, and this foray into the Arctic was part of a broader effort to remedy one of them.

﻿In a drive to move Germany toward economic self-sufficiency, Hitler had imposed draconian tariffs, refused to honor foreign-debt obligations, and sought to wean the nation off Norwegian whale-oil consumption. The problem was that Germany used whale oil not only for margarine, a staple of the German diet, but also in the production of nitroglycerin, a key component for the munitions industry. Whale-oil imports ranged from 165,000 to 220,000 tons annually, representing the country’s single largest foreign-currency expenditure. To replace Norwegian whale oil, it was proposed that “German ships with German fishermen using German equipment” could harvest “the riches of the sea”—or Fischreichtum—“without giving a single penny to foreign countries.” So Hitler mobilized a German whaling fleet that gradually depleted whale populations in the North. By 1938, the Germans also had 31 whale-oil-processing ships in the frozen South, off the coast of Antarctica, along with two processing stations on land supplied by 257 “catcher boats.” Plans were made to declare the “whaling enterprises” German colonial possessions.

In mid-January 1939, two twin-engine Dornier “flying boats”—model Do 18-D—coursed along the coast of Antarctica, dropping weighted steel rods stamped with swastikas and bearing Nazi flags every 15 miles or so. The secret expedition, overseen by Göring and led by Alfred Ritscher, one of Germany’s top Arctic explorers, was intended to stake a territorial claim “corresponding to the expansion of the economic interests of greater Germany,” as Ritscher later put it.

The Antarctic demarcation project undertaken by Ritscher in January 1939 was part of Hitler’s aggressive peacetime land grab in the name of ethnic unification and national security, beginning with the annexation of Austria in March 1938 and continuing with the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in September of that year.

Hitler dismissed those who opposed the acquisition of land on the grounds of human rights as “scribblers.” No divine authority dictated how much land a people possessed or occupied, Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: “National borders are made by men, and they are changed by men.” A country’s claim to territory was based on its ability to impose brute force over another, a principle that dated back, Hitler continued, to days of the “might of a victorious sword,” when Germanic tribes asserted themselves with blood and iron. “Und nur in dieser Kraft allein liegt dann das Recht,” Hitler wrote, a maxim that, distilled into English, translates as “Might makes right.”

Following the invasion of Poland, in 1939, Hitler’s interests in the Far North expanded from economic to military. On April 8, 1940, Hitler briefed his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, on an imminent military operation in Denmark and Norway. The preemptive strike, Hitler explained, was a defensive measure against an anticipated attack by Britain and France that he believed might come via Scandinavia. (Sweden had already declared its neutrality.) “Approximately 250,000 men will carry out the operation,” Goebbels wrote in his diary. “Most of the artillery and ammunition have already been transported across, hidden in coal steamers.” The next morning, six infantry divisions, two motorized brigades, a paratrooper unit, and hundreds of aircraft, including 186 Heinkel bombers, launched Operation Weser Maneuver. Denmark capitulated. Norway resisted and was crushed. “Once we have the two countries,” Goebbels recorded, “England will be flattened” because Germany could use Scandinavia as “a base of attack.” As for the United States? That country “is of no interest to us,” Goebbels wrote, because by the time the Americans could deliver any material assistance (eight months, in Goebbels’s reckoning) or put boots on the ground in Europe (18 months), the war would be over.

But unbeknownst to Goebbels, U.S. Coast Guard cruisers were already on their way to Greenland. A strategic analysis had determined that a well-directed shot from a German U-boat or an act of sabotage could cripple the cryolite-mining operations at Ivittuut, in the Arsuk Fjord in South Greenland, which America was determined to safeguard to protect its aluminum production.

Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish ambassador in Washington, D.C., distanced himself from the government in German-occupied Copenhagen and declared himself the representative of “the interests of the free Denmark,” a status the United States readily recognized. The American Greenland Commission was formed, and an American consulate was opened in Godthaab, the island’s capital city (today known as Nuuk), with the consent of Eske Brun, Greenland’s colonial administrator, who was an ally of Kauffmann’s. “Adaptability of areas for installation of airfields was the first consideration governing location of forces,” Kaufmann later recalled. “Since these areas were of the same value to Germany as to the United States, these, in addition to the cryolite mine, were the localities actively defended.”

“The Eskimos in Greenland will be astonished to see how the Americans are staffing their newly established consulate,” the German newspaper Schwäbischer Merkur reported on June 9, 1940, questioning the purpose of the “ten officers and 167 men” that the Americans had dispatched to “peaceful” Greenland. “Under international law,” the newspaper observed, “Greenland belongs to Denmark.”

Another Nazi-aligned newspaper, Stuttgarter NS-Kurier, reminded its readers of Greenland’s status under international law, noting that the American presence was causing “serious disquiet” in Denmark: “It goes without saying that there cannot be any talk of a change in the Danish position toward an apparent American interference in the administration of Greenland, Denmark’s last colonial holding.”

Read: The intellectual rationalization for annexing Greenland

On April 9, 1941, exactly one year after the German occupation of Denmark, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Kauffmann, with the assent of the Greenland colonial administrator, signed the Agreement Between the United States of America and Denmark Respecting the Defense of Greenland. The preamble of the agreement highlighted the imminent danger that Greenland “may be converted into a point of aggression against nations of the American continent.” The subsequent articles allowed the United States to “improve and deepen” harbors and to “construct, maintain and operate such landing fields, seaplane facilities and radio and meteorological installations as necessary” for the protection of the North American continent against foreign aggression.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt publicly hailed the agreement the next day. In America, Ambassador Kauffmann, as the defender of “free Denmark,” was proclaimed “king of Greenland”; in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen, he was charged with treason.

On April 27, Danish Foreign Minister Erik Scavenius, claiming to act on instructions from the Danish king, issued a formal note to Hull protesting Kauffmann’s actions. By signing the bilateral agreement, Scavenius wrote, Kauffmann had acted “against the will and knowledge of His Majesty,” as well as against the “Cabinet and the Danish Rigsdag,” the equivalent of the U.S. Congress. “From real as well as from formal points of view,” Scavenius wrote, “the Danish Government has therefore been obliged to consider the agreement as invalid in point of Danish constitutional as well as international law.” For the United States to have entered into an agreement with “a person who has no country and no head of state behind him” was, Scavenius wrote, “a fiction.”

If so, this fiction was similar to the one the British government had endorsed a year earlier, after Germany had invaded France and installed the collaborationist Vichy regime. In June 1940, a 49-year-old colonel who had led the French army’s 4th Armored Division in counterattacks against the Germans at Abbeville retreated to London after France surrendered. The British recognized the colonel, Charles de Gaulle, as the self-declared representative of the “free French”; the Vichy government denounced de Gaulle as a traitor and deserter, stripping him of his military rank, convicting him of treason, and sentencing him to death in absentia.

The Americans, like the British, recognized the distinction between a fascist takeover by force and the prerogatives of a democratically elected government. So just as de Gaulle was recognized as the legitimate representative of France, Kauffman was recognized as the legitimate representative of Denmark and Greenland. Over the next four years, Greenland became a vital transit point for the Allies—it had as many as 17 military facilities, including airfields and naval installations that protected the cryolite-mining operation at Ivittuut—and assisted in the liberation of hundreds of millions of Europeans across the continent. When the war was over and the democratically elected government in Denmark was restored, it willingly reaffirmed this American protection in the 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement, which remains in effect today.</div>

            <h2>The West’s Winter Has Been a Slow-Moving Catastrophe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.

In Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.

But temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.

Hickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.

“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.

Climatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”

Schumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.

Western water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.

That snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.

In most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”

This is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)

Further in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.</div>

            <div id="article-text">If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.

People are realizing that, if you work for someone else, the only reward for working extra hard is more work.

If you&#39;re going to really bust your ass, do it for yourself. Otherwise just do what&#39;s required to get paid well. Put in your 8 hours and then call it a day. Let some other poor sucker work a bunch of unpaid overtime just so they can get a 4% raise instead of the usual 3%, which works out to much less than fast-food level wages on the extra hours.

Yes, in between the studies we get a lot of &quot;AI&quot; slashvertisements.

AI can take jobs from those producing nothing and produce nothing itself.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a win-win or a lose-lose.

Of course. Because both kind of stories get the clicks.

Or at least it shouldn&#39;t be unless a manager listened to some stupid consultants advise about saving money on mission critical aspects of the company.Have you never worked in an office?

AI costs 3% of humans for the jobs being replaced... but we shouldn&#39;t worry because the other 97% will be made up by people hired to maintain thevAI?

That is so obviously wrong I hesitate to even call it math.  The logic is so flawed I suspect Stevens is deliberately lying, a moron, or both.   If you pay a human to maintain an AI syste

Is one of the worlds most despicable companies. One of their many business models for gaining new customers is that they have former executives &quot;leave&quot; their company, move to another company, then immediately fire IT at that company and shift services to Accenture. It is extraordinarily corrupt.

They used to be called Andersen Consulting, a part of Arthur Andersen.

If AI is nearly as good as hyped, Accenture itself will be entirely replaced by it.

&quot;Throw out anything generated by AI&quot; - Does this apply to the HR people and their forms?  That would level the playing field and eliminate a lot of the problems on both sides

I rent out a house in England and the tenant had a (reasonable) complaint. She emailed 3000 words to the managing agent. The agent sent her a 2000 word reply. This bounced back and forth a bit with each sending long emails with bullet points and the like. My guess is that both of them were using ChatGPT both to compose their own emails and to summarise the replies they got.

In frustration, she phoned me to complain and got what she wanted in less than 60 seconds. In my opinion, we will see much more examples like this where AI is reducing efficiency and lowering productivity.

reducing efficiency and lowering productivity.

So cynical. In a modern economy such things increase productivity. And by &quot;modern economy&quot; I mean at least everything post invention of agriculture.

Every time we reduce the need for people to grow food, pound nails, dig ditches, or whatever, we invent a bunch of new jobs like professional priest, receptionist, lawyer, HR specialist, etc. These jobs are inevitably higher paying than the ones they replace, and thus increase overall productivity.

Solution: dismiss with prejudice any complaint which includes such falsities.

I suspect most are not necessarily false, just vague or opaque, using ambiguous language or hard-to-verify claims.

Presumably, any protections that exist for employees filing grievances do not protect those employees when they file provably false statements.  I can imagine many HR teams, once they realize the gift they have been handed, will be reacting with glee as they receive a free pass to bin off what they likely already perceive as troublemakers instead of having to walk on eggshells when disciplining them.

I have very little respect for corporate HR and in particular their ability to adequately handle employee grievances.  So if they&#39;re getting drowned in AI Slop, I&#39;m inclined to think &quot;And That&#39;s A Good Thing.&quot;

Yeah, this is hilarious.  This is the group that started introducing DEI and other policies into corporate environments, given that once the Open Enrollment was over, they generally had nothing to do.  Yeah, there was the occasional onboarding work they had to do, but largely, when they weren&#39;t doing recruitment searches, they were mostly idle.  That&#39;s how they started smuggling in activities that had nothing to do w/ a company&#39;s overall corporate goals, and gave us the last decade of woke corporations

More likely, they are a litigant in person because lawyers are expensive. Filling out an ET1 is not easy if you are not a lawyer, so people resort to using AI. If you are on a zero-hours contract and your last employer didn&#39;t pay you your last paycheck for say Â£400, you are not hiring a lawyer, but that Â£400 quid is actually going to make a big difference to your finances.

That said, my brother (an actual Employment Tribunal Judge in the UK) tells me he has caught legal firms using AI

Original post (not by me):https://www.linkedin.com/feed/... [linkedin.com]

My team caught someone who sent an AI to interview in their place.

It sounds so crazy that I didn&#39;t believe it until I reviewed the transcripts:

Interviewer: &quot;Can you tell us about yourself?&quot;

Candidate: &quot;Absolutely! I&#39;m a passionate professional who thrives in dynamic environments.&quot;

Interviewer: &quot;That&#39;s a really insightful answer.&quot;

Candidate: &quot;Thank you! You&#39;re absolutely right.&quot;

Interviewer: &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right too.&quot;

Candidate: &quot;You&#39;re absolutely right about that.&quot;

Interviewer: &quot;We&#39;re both absolutely right.&quot;

Interviewer: &quot;This is going really well.&quot;

The transcript goes on like this for 14 more pages.

Thank goodness we&#39;re using AI to screen our candidates, otherwise we might have wasted our time talking to someone who can&#39;t even be bothered to show up to a call.

This should not be a problem at all. As soon as these white collar jobs(lawyers and HR) are replaced their relacement AIs should be able to process and sort out the details in seconds.

Create a non-AI-based (thus much more efficient) tool that scans filings for case citations and checks them against the legal records. Flag any that don&#39;t exist. For those that do, provide the language around the citation saying what the filing claims that case says and the actual judgement part of the case on record for a human to review. That&#39;ll make it quick to flag citations that don&#39;t say what the filing claims they say. Anything flagged results in an automatic dismissal of the case and sanctions again

Just use AI to process the complaint. If AI judges it to be valid, dispatch a robot to usher the accused employee to the door. What could be simpler?

We all know the emperor has no clothes. We know the &quot;stories&quot; are PR pieces from AI boosters. We know that autocorrect can&#39;t replace anybody whose job doesn&#39;t involve following an exact script or redoing work that already exist.

Just stop it. Stop promulgating the nonsense. There is no &quot;I&quot; in AI and there is no creativity in the autocorrect that they&#39;re pushing on us.

In the meantime we&#39;re paying higher electricity costs and having to hold off purchases of equipment or pay extortionate prices f

Sounds good, until the AI hyperscale market collapses in a year or two. Then RAM (and storage) will sell for ten cents on the dollar. Just as your new DRAM foundry rolls it&#39;s first wafers off the assembly line.

Someone will probably say &quot;something something AI&quot; to say we could build out faster.

About 40 months in the US and EU, more like 20 months in China and Taiwan. Somewhere inbetween for S. Korea.

Successfully producing top tier DRAM with high enough yield to be profitable is a little harder to pin down. If you hired a bunch of people that walked out of Samsung and SK Hynix maybe 5 months. Or if you do things from the ground up, 5 years. Doing a previous generation and then catching up on your next foundry build out is perhaps safer.

No. Not even with retooling an existing fab that already makes something else with the same structure density.

Even more unbelievable that somebody will lend you the money for it, because FABs on that level are extremely expensive.

Consumer DDR5 platforms have a hard time using more than a pair of DDR5 modules at any but the slowest timing and currently don&#39;t support DIMMs larger than 64GB. Workstation and Server Platforms can already support more RAM than that, but if you&#39;re buying a new enough Threadripper, Epyc, Xeon or Ampere platform to handle DDR5, you&#39;re almost certainly buying it with rDIMMs in the first place.

Further, even if the market doesn&#39;t &quot;collapse&quot;, it would still transition to something more like a &quot;sustaining&quot; market rather than ever expanding buildout.

Very slow and expensive to try to solve what will, one way or another, be a temporary problem.

I agree that it is slow, expensive, and ultimately, a temporary problem.

My question is, how long will it last? When will demand for RAM decrease or when will RAM production capabilities catch up with demand?

I don&#39;t have a clue. One could make an argument for a crash in demand this year or five years from now.. Too many unknowns.

And that is why the RAM manufacturers will do no or only very careful extension of production volumes.

Consolidation is not an intelligent path long term. Yet, somehow, we&#39;re allowing a singular industry trend to capture not just the speculative market, but entire giant segments of the manufacturing sphere, as well as starting to make preparations to allow it to allow it to capture other resources, like electrical production, access to fresh water, and, of course, the all important tax dollar subsidies that all big business actually runs on.

When you pull back from this, and look at it from afar, what it looks like is an attempt to clamp down and maintain a hold of an entire society via technological means. We&#39;re putting all our eggs in one basket, and potentially limitless profit generating basket for a very small number of people, at the expense of all the rest of us. It&#39;s already consolidating the data of people, of books, of music, of movies, all data. And it seems determined to consolidate the rest of humanity&#39;s available resources. And when that consolidation is complete, will there be anything left for the rest of us? And even if there is, what happens if/when that one, singular entity that we have given all power, all resources, all data, and all focus suddenly breaks, or loses momentum? Do we just shrug and standby watching as our world falls into the technologically driven blackhole we&#39;ve created?

We, the collective we, are being absolute idiots about this whole AI/LLM thing. We&#39;ve allowed it to subsume too much already, and it seems all world leaders are determined to keep throwing resources at it. &quot;We must or someone else will.&quot; It seems stupid to continue down this path, but no one with the power to top it or even slow it a bit and consider the consequences, has any interest in doing anything other than continuing to accelerate the consolidation. It&#39;s like the greed of the elites manifested in a completely carcinogenic and caustic manner, and it will not be stopped until it has metastasized and subsumed the entirety of human society.

We, the collective we, are being absolute idiots about this whole AI/LLM thing.Indeed. It is both fascinating and really embarrassing to watch. At the same time, the best figures on &quot;efficiency gain&quot; are currently at something like 4%. That is likely way below the measurement error, i.e. there may not be any gains at all and the whole thing is a loss.

If you think having the RAM market supplied by 10 manufacturers rather than 3 would make the slightest bit of difference to the current price hikes, I have a bridge to sell you.

Clearly failed Economics 101. The same market forces pushing manufacturers to supply AI data centres would still exist, and RAM manufacturers would likely make the same choices they are making now.

Most people do not mean forever.  In the tech world, forever is a decade.

They will make more RAM due to demand and competition... but it takes a long time to ramp up and it is expensive. This will feel like forever.

Furthermore, AI wants the best RAM and not everybody is making the best RAM.  So, when DDR6 happens, it&#39;ll be possibly out of consumer hardware for a longer delay and priced higher for longer obviously.  The bubble will burst but it doesn&#39;t have to be like other bubbles. Many view this as existen

And on top of that, Win11 runs much, much worse than Win10 with bizarre problems and unreliabilities on hardware that was perfectly fine with Win10.

If only a free alternative existed that ran better on that &quot;obsolete hardware&quot; than the new devices nobody can afford.Microsoft could exit the way they arrived: on the availability of the hardware they require.

>If only a free alternative existed that ran better on that &quot;obsolete hardware&quot; than the new devices nobody can afford.Indeed ! 2026 will be the year of the desktop for ReactOS !! Right ? ;p

Some are asking if this is a business opportunity to start a new RAM fab/manufacturer.  Those responding are correctly commenting that if could take 2-3+ years to build a State-of-the-Art fab from the ground up.  I work in that industry, and frankly those timeframes are optimistic.

The question we should really be asking is, why do most consumer devices need State-of-the-Art DRAM?  Sure, maybe the gaming folks want it.  Maybe even CAD, Animation Labs, etc.  But for my phone?  Nahh.  6-year old RAM tech is fine.

Mass Semiconductor manufacturing is hard and expensive, but if an acceptable platform can be legacy tech, it should be WAY easier and cheaper to spin up, especially since a lot of that equipment is being replaced and is likely available for sale pre-owned, not to mention all the fab space likely being abandoned in favor of newer fab space (because that&#39;s how fab companies typically roll out new tech...build new fab, convert the older fab to the next tech.)  And then there&#39;s Intel and TI in the US with tons of fab space sitting idle anyway.

I wonder if there&#39;s a big industrial economy that&#39;s motivated to beef up its domestic chip making capability that would be interested in capturing the 20ish nm flash, psram, DDR4 etc market?

Amazon is selling all sorts of crazy low quality stuff from knock-off brands contributing a lot of volume. As bad as wal-mart is, even they wouldn&#39;t carry a lot of that junk on shelves.

The other thing that may play a factor is that Wal Mart is *notoriously* dickish to suppliers.  Refusing to accept certain things the suppliers want to sell, demanding packages that don&#39;t make sense even as the sales prove the supplier right, wal mart keeps pushing.

You and geekmux don&#39;t seem to have actually looked at Walmart&#39;s website. They sell the same kind of AliExpress sourced shit, but not quite at the same low prices.

However Amazon does two things that WalMart will never replicate, and in some ways gives them an enormous edge.

            <div id="article-text">For many of us, living in President Donald Trump’s America feels like a never-ending doom loop. Every day brings a fresh batch of headlines about the administration’s lawless attacks on independent federal agencies, the judiciary, and our democracy itself—and you can easily miss some important things. To help you sift through the noise, we’re launching a new newsletter: Executive Dysfunction. Each week, we will surface one important legal story that you may have overlooked amid all the ongoing chaos. We’ll be highlighting stories about how Trump is doing violence to the law, and stories about how people involved in shaping and upholding the law—judges, lawyers, lawmakers—are pushing back. And we’ll also keep you in the loop about what’s going on with our Slate Jurisprudence team, including Mark Joseph Stern and Dahlia Lithwick. Welcome to the first edition of Executive Dysfunction. To sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every week, please click here.

You may have missed it over the long weekend, but a partial government shutdown began on Saturday. After over a year of enduring President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda—as we’ve watched masked agents drag people through the streets, harass families in their homes, and even kill U.S. citizens in broad daylight—Democrats in Washington decided to use their power over federal funding to try to force change. Before signing off on any new dollars for the Department of Homeland Security, Democrats have put forth a list of 10 demands they want Republicans to meet in an effort to rein in a rogue Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

One big question remains, though, as we wait to see if the partial shutdown begins to affect the day-to-day of Americans in travel and other parts of life: Would the Democratic demands, if met, actually do anything to stem ICE’s abuses? This question has already spurred fights on social media, where some progressives are excoriating the Democrats for not asking for nearly enough, and others are praising these proposals as pragmatic solutions that will make a real difference. The truth is probably somewhere in between.

“What these mostly require is for ICE to follow laws and return to practices and procedures that had been standard practice for a long period of time,” Scott Shuchart, former assistant director for regulatory affairs for ICE under the Biden administration, told me. “And so they’re not very ambitious.” ICE would not be completely transformed by this particular set of Democratic demands; rather, it would return to a pre-Trump status quo when we were not witnessing masked agents rampaging across the entire country, pepper-spraying children, ripping disabled people out of their cars, and gunning men and women down in the street.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ list of demands—unveiled in early February, shortly after Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis—ranges from banning agents from wearing masks to outlawing racial profiling. Progressives want the party to go further, while activists have been pushing to simply abolish ICE completely. Voters want something to give, with polling consistently showing they are seriously concerned about the way the Trump administration is handling immigration enforcement.

When looking at Democrats’ list of demands, it’s important to consider that U.S. immigration law has not been significantly updated since Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act in 1996. Whatever the party manages to win in this government funding negotiation will likely be narrow and insufficient to solve our country’s biggest immigration challenges, but it could pare back some of the worst excesses and abuses of the current administration. Thus far, negotiations don’t seem to be going anywhere. It’s also hard to say whether ICE would even obey any new restrictions, given the administration’s persistent refusal to comply with congressional directives and the Supreme Court’s tolerance for such defiance. During a recent congressional oversight hearing, for instance, DHS leadership outright rejected a mask ban, one of Democrats’ key demands.

Let’s take a closer look at the list to try to assess whether the demands actually stand a chance of making a material difference in how ICE uses—and abuses—its vast power over immigration enforcement.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS officers from entering private property without a judicial warrant. This is something that’s technically already against the law, though the administration has attempted to circumvent that very basic right with little pushback. “That’s what the Fourth Amendment has always required,” Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council, told me. “The hope here would be not just that Congress restates the law, but that they offer some consequences for the fact that officers don’t follow them, whether that’s dismissal of cases of anyone they arrest once they’re inside, or other disciplinary measures.” According to the public-facing list, there’s no real enforcement mechanism, though this may get sorted out in the writing of any legislation.

Also baked into this demand is a requirement that ICE officers verify that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention, as has reportedly happened countless times in recent months. This could be one of the harder things for Republicans to say no to. During congressional hearings last week, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons seemed to acknowledge how politically perilous it is for the agency to be detaining U.S. citizens, hemming and hawing when asked if ICE arrested and deported U.S. citizens, before saying that the agency did only “detain” Americans.

While this feels like a straightforward demand, Shuchart believes that Democrats not taking it further is a missed opportunity to rein in the indiscriminate detention of thousands of immigrants, whether or not they have any sort of criminal background or present any sort of flight risk. “I would like to see this Congress clarify the detention authority and undo this craziness that ICE is doing, where everybody is now subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention.”

Prohibiting immigration enforcement agents from wearing face coverings is something many states are already attempting to implement through legislation. However, these state efforts face challenges in court given broad federal authority to enforce U.S. immigration law and local officers’ fear of conflict with other armed law-enforcement agents. A federal judge recently blocked a new California law prohibiting federal agents from wearing masks, holding that it “unlawfully discriminates against the federal government” because it did not apply to all state officers as well. Although California could in theory address this defect, the ruling illustrates the constitutional challenges that states face when regulating a federal agency, and shows the need for a uniform, nationwide rule from Congress.

Congressional Democrats are also trying to compel immigration enforcement agents to display their agency, unique ID number, and last name. This would be a significant policy change, something Shuchart says would go beyond existing law. As Felipe De La Hoz recently noted in Slate, it wouldn’t reverse the fact that ICE is currently enrolling any and all federal law-enforcement agencies into a vast police “blob” as part of its immigration agenda. It would, though, allow people to at a minimum recognize who is taking part in any given enforcement action, leading to a greater potential for future accountability and a chance that agents will think twice before committing abuses.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS funds from being used to conduct enforcement near sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, child care centers, churches, polling places, and courts. If Republicans agree to this proposal, Shuchart said, it would be an enormous change in current policy.

This demand would revert back to the Biden administration’s position, and in theory would end the Trump administration’s strategy of arresting migrants who show up to court-mandated hearings. It could also stop ICE agents from entering hospitals and interfering with patients’ medical care, as was the case in Minnesota. Health care workers there reported an incident when ICE agents hovered over the bedside of a patient for more than 24 hours, at times shackling them to the bed and denying them privacy. In another encounter with ICE, agents remained present while a patient was being bathed.

Democrats also want to bar DHS officers from detaining people based on their ethnicity, spoken language, accent, or place of work. In September, the Supreme Court seemed to signal that these detentions—known as “Kavanaugh stops”—are permissible under the Fourth Amendment. But that decision does not prevent Congress from forbidding them by legislation. This would be a sea change in immigration policy if Democrats can get it.

However, as currently written, this proposal includes no penalty for DHS or individual officers if they were to violate such a ban. And if there is no way to hold agents or agencies accountable, then “it’s a meaningless restriction,” Gupta said.

This is a critical demand where, according to Shuchart, Democrats have fallen short. They are asking that DHS institute a “reasonable use of force policy, expand training and require certification of officers. In the case of an incident, the officer must be removed from the field until an investigation is conducted.” However, the demand does not define what a “reasonable” policy is, nor does it mention how this would be implemented.

It’s worth noting that last year, the Trump administration shut down DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an oversight agency that was responsible for investigating allegations against the agency from migrants, their families, and the public. Reinstating this office could play a critical role in upholding any use-of-force policy, according to Shuchart. It’s not in the list of Democratic demands, however. “I think the entire model of leaving the immigration agencies to their own devices and hoping for accountability on the back end just doesn’t work, and Congress needs to find a way to be much more prescriptive about what it expects,” Shuchart noted.

In light of the FBI stonewalling Minnesota prosecutors’ efforts to investigate the killing of Renee Nicole Good and withholding evidence from Alex Pretti’s death, Democrats are asking to codify a requirement that DHS “preserve the ability of state and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute potential crimes and use of excessive force incidents.” It also would require that evidence be preserved and shared with local jurisdictions. This issue flared up when the federal government appeared to allow the contamination of evidence from the scene of Pretti’s killing, then refused to let state investigators access that evidence in an alarming breach of protocol.

This reform could help states win federal court orders securing access to evidence when immigration agents commit violent crimes within their borders. But again, it does not create any new ways of holding immigration agents accountable for abuses, a weak spot across these demands. Until victims and their families can file claims against officers who violate their rights, there will be few disincentives against excessive use of force. “There are more meaningful reforms that could have been included, in particular ensuring that there is a way for people to individually sue federal officers who violate constitutional and civil rights,” Gupta said. Right now, it is almost impossible for victims to file such suits, thanks in part to a series of Supreme Court decisions shielding federal officials from accountability. But Congress has the power to effectively overturn these rulings and create liability for federal officials by statute.

Democrats want to hold DHS to a higher standard when it comes to immigration detention, as many of us have seen and read about the horrific conditions at detention centers, where illnesses are rampant, medical care is scarce, and access to clean water and food is limited.

Through this demand, Democrats are asking to standardize all buildings where people are detained, ensuring that each one abides by the same basic detention standards and requiring immediate access to a person’s attorney to prevent citizen arrests or detention. States would also be allowed to sue DHS for violating these requirements, and federal lawmakers would be allowed to inspect ICE facilities.

This demand, though, doesn’t address the specific sanitation issues at ICE detention centers, nor does it attempt to claw back the agency’s authority to set its own standards, where Shuchart believes that the real problem lies. “Congress needs to have enforceable detention standards in place, rather than letting ICE write its own detention standards and hoping that the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will hold them to that,” Shuchart said. “Because guess what? The administration got rid of CRCL, and now nobody on the outside is holding ICE to its standards.”

Forcing federal agents to use body-worn cameras when interacting with the public has been a hotly debated issue, with some arguing it deters officers from misbehaving, while others feel it does little to inhibit abuses. (The agents who shot Pretti were reportedly wearing body cameras.) During that recent congressional hearing, acting Director Lyons confirmed that many federal agents are already using body cameras and the agency intends to roll them out to every agent.

Just last week, body-camera footage of a Border Patrol agent involved in the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago was released, and it appeared to contradict DHS’s version of the incident. Body-cam footage from other violent incidents in Chicago demonstrated that federal agents were brazenly lying about protesters’ actions to justify excessive force against them. Shuchart said that policing experts tend to believe that body cameras are valuable, as they improve the quality of police interactions with the public. Especially considering the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, where they have outright lied about what actually happened in high-profile ICE encounters, Shuchart thinks Democrats’ demand for body cameras is the right move.

Democrats also want to prohibit the footage from being used to track Americans in a database of people exercising their First Amendment rights, something that federal agents have threatened protesters with. This is a critical safety measure, as we’re seeing the administration abusing its powers to intimidate those who criticize it, and it seems to be surveilling dissenters.

The bottom line for this entire list of demands is that some of what Democrats are asking for would have a real impact in counteracting how ICE has been operating with impunity across the country, but it truly is a bare minimum. If they fold, though, without achieving many of these baseline limits on ICE’s ability to abuse citizens and noncitizens alike, Democrats will themselves be on the hook the next time ICE commits a high-profile atrocity like the ones we’ve seen so frequently in Minneapolis.

Dahlia Lithwick covered a number of these issues in the most recent episode of Amicus. Lithwick spoke with Linus Chan, a professor and lawyer in Minneapolis who has been working with clients caught in ICE’s snare during the recent surge, about the way ICE has been getting around the current restrictions that already exist on its detention authority.

In that same episode, she also spoke with journalist Andrea Pitzer about the Stephen Miller campaign to expand the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity for mass detention and how it already resembles some of the darkest periods in human history.

In the Slate Plus segment of that episode, Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the various breadcrumbs that Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito has been leaving us that he intends to retire this summer, and what it would mean for the court for its staunchest partisan to step down.

Amherst College law professor and Slate contributor Austin Sarat wrote about another issue that seems destined soon to reach the Supreme Court: whether Texas will execute a likely innocent man, Charles Flores, or whether the high court will force the state to reconsider Flores’ case.

On Tuesday, Trump’s most vile spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, announced she would be departing her job at DHS. Stern explained how this is a bittersweet moment for immigration activists, who relied heavily on McLaughlin’s outlandish statements to disprove DHS lies in court.

From the hundreds of Washington Post staffers fired, to Anderson Cooper leaving 60 Minutes, to Stephen Colbert and his own network fighting in public, Trump’s return to the White House is transforming legacy media into something less antagonistic to power—but also less capable of fulfilling its own self-described mission.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that its top spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, would depart the agency after just over a year on the job. To most, McLaughlin is probably best known for slandering Americans wounded or killed by immigration agents—including Renee Good (whom she accused of “domestic terrorism”) and Alex Pretti (whom she claimed sought to “massacre law enforcement”). Inside the legal system, though, McLaughlin is known for something else: Actively sabotaging the Department of Homeland Security in court through her crass, often false public statements. Most notably, McLaughlin has gained notoriety for smearing judges who rule against the Trump administration, deriding them as “activist,” “craven,” “out of control” partisans engaged in “judicial sabotage,” “race-baiting,” and stoking “the embers of hatred.”

President Donald Trump has praised her tactics, but they have done her department no favors in front of these judges. It was perhaps inevitable that judges would bristle at a government spokeswoman deriding them as hacks. But McLaughlin did not merely alienate the judiciary; she consistently undermined the administration’s legal arguments, sabotaging lawyers’ efforts to cover up unlawful conduct by boasting about it on social media. Judges then cited these posts to refute the administration’s claims and rule against it. Few if any government spokespeople have done more to kneecap their own agency in court than McLaughlin.

The gap between this administration’s public statements and legal assertions has been a stubborn problem since Trump returned to office, but nowhere is it more chasmic than DHS. In their briefings, government lawyers finesse a sanitized version into a clean narrative of law-abiding responsibility. At hearings, they insist that the department adheres to high standards of professionalism and good-faith compliance. But McLaughlin’s confrontational declarations to the press routinely punctured this fiction. And lawyers suing DHS pointed judges toward her messaging as evidence of the agency’s real actions and policies—which were, quite often, flagrantly illegal.

Escobar Molina v. DHS illustrates this pattern perfectly. It marked a challenge to immigration agents’ widespread warrantless arrests of suspected immigrants in the District of Columbia, which seemingly targeted anyone who appeared Hispanic. The plaintiffs—lawful residents and American citizens caught up in the dragnet—sued, alleging violations of a statute that allows warrantless arrests only when agents have “probable cause” that an individual is undocumented. In court, lawyers for the department attested that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection rigorously adhered to this standard. Outside of court, however, McLaughlin kept contradicting them, asserting over and over again that immigration agents did not require probable cause to arrest a person suspected of lacking lawful status. To the contrary, she said that agents merely required “reasonable suspicion,” a much more lenient standard. This was not a one-off: McLaughlin repeated her claim over and over again, and amplified it from DHS’s official accounts.

Judge Beryl Howell was not pleased with this discrepancy. At one hearing, she ordered government lawyers to explain whether they or McLaughlin were stating the agency’s true position. The lawyers tried to dismiss McLaughlin’s comments, saying she did not “necessarily understand” “legal terms of art” because she was not a lawyer. “This,” Howell later wrote, “is a remarkable assertion.” The government seemed to be saying that McLaughlin was “ignorant or incompetent, or both.” Howell scolded the lawyers for their failure to “prevent these statements from being made in DHS’s official communications to the public.” And she concluded that McLaughlin’s statements must be “taken at face value as reflecting the current policy and practice of DHS and federal law enforcement agents making civil immigration arrests.” Howell then issued an injunction barring warrantless immigration arrests without probable cause in D.C. (The government says it will appeal her ruling but has not yet done so.)

McLaughlin also helped to botch ICE’s efforts to keep immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra-Ramirez locked up without bond. Federal agents arrested Vizguerra-Ramirez while she was on a work break from Target, just one day after she marched against Trump in a widely publicized protest. ICE boasted of the arrest online, and McLaughlin took a victory lap on X, writing: “We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.’ ” The implication seemed to be that ICE had singled out Vizguerra-Ramirez to send a message that no immigrant was safe.

The courts paid attention. Judge Nina Wang later pointed to this tweet as evidence that the administration “sought to make an example of Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez by arresting and detaining an individual with a high profile as a labor and immigration activist.” McLaughlin’s brag that the government had snagged a well-known advocate raised “unique due process concerns,” Wang wrote, and contributed to her conclusion that Vizguerra-Ramirez’s detention violated the Fifth Amendment. Wang ordered a bond hearing, and Vizguerra-Ramirez was quickly released. She remains free today and continues to challenge her order of removal.

McLaughlin’s X account has, in fact, routinely corroborated plaintiffs’ claims that DHS is violating the Constitution. In one case challenging the revocation of student visas because of anti-Israel activism, the government argued that it was merely trying to avoid “adverse foreign policy consequences,” not punishing protected speech. Judge Noël Wise didn’t buy it, pointing to McLaughlin’s insistence that those “pushing Hamas propaganda” and similar “anti-American conduct” would see their visas revoked. Wise cited McLaughlin’s warning as evidence that the government was retaliating against “expression related to Israel and Palestine,” denying the government’s motion to dismiss the case. Judge William Young also cited McLaughlin’s post in ruling that the administration had violated the First Amendment by detaining and deporting pro-Gaza activists. DHS lawyers spent many hours camouflaging their speech suppression in neutral terms, only to see McLaughlin tweet out the real—and unconstitutional—reason for the crackdown.

Sometimes McLaughlin stepped on more prosaic rakes. In a case challenging immigration agents’ excessive force against protesters, the government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the threat of future violence was too speculative. This contention seemed to be bolstered by a credible news report that immigration agents would imminently end the surge and, with it, the plaintiffs’ need for relief. But McLaughlin promptly refuted the report on X, writing: “We aren’t leaving Chicago.” Judge Sara Ellis then used her post to show that the threat of continued violence was all too real, granting the protesters standing.

It’s easy to see why McLaughlin believed she could undermine or contradict her agency’s official position in court without consequence. Trump posts bizarre and aggressive rants on Truth Social all the time, yet courts mostly ignore his late-night ramblings. But that’s because the Supreme Court has shied away from using a president’s public comments as proof of policy, preferring to focus on official communications like executive orders (ostensibly out of respect for the office). The rules for DHS are different: SCOTUS subjects agencies to far more scrutiny and demands that they tell the truth about their decisions. Federal courts may block agency actions that are “arbitrary and capricious,” and statements by a spokesperson can be evidence that an agency is breaking the law.

McLaughlin’s departure may therefore be bittersweet news to the many lawyers now litigating against DHS. Sure, she vilified immigrants, smeared protesters, and attacked judges. Sometimes, though, she also told the truth, in ways that were inadvertently beneficial to the targets of her ire. If she is replaced by a more disciplined spokesperson, the courts may have a more difficult time smoking out the real, lawless policies driving Trump’s mass deportation machine. McLaughlin’s comments were reliably abhorrent. But they were, with remarkable frequency, also a smoking gun.

Trump’s “Board of Peace” emerged from last year’s ceasefire negotiations to govern Gaza after the war. But since then, the board has evolved into a motley group of countries that are willing to pay a billion dollars to join a body that has Donald Trump as its chairman for life. They also have mostly stopped talking about Gaza.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some AI advocates claim that bots hold the secret to mitigating climate change. But research shows that the reality is far different, as new datacenters cause power utilities to burn even more fossil fuels to meet their insatiable demand for energy.

It has been a common refrain of late that, as the tech industry&#39;s single-minded focus hones in on AI, abandoning climate pledges in the process and embracing quick-to-build fossil fuel power plants to drive its datacenters, the AI being spun up in new mega facilities would simply solve the problem for them.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has pushed that line of reasoning, as has Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, both arguing that AI&#39;s long-term climate benefits could outweigh, or help offset, the emissions associated with the growing power demands of datacenters. Others, including the International Energy Agency, claim to have support for the same.

With funding from climate action groups, energy analyst Ketan Joshi, however, is suggesting that AI firms and research from groups that support their plans, like the IEA, aren&#39;t just wrong, but may be intentionally greenwashing the problem.

Joshi&#39;s report was published this week and funded by groups including Beyond Fossil Fuels, Climate Action Against Disinformation, and Friends of the Earth U.S. He reached two central conclusions after looking at 154 claims of AI climate benefits arising from eight sources (including the IEA, climate researchers, Microsoft, Google, and others).

First off, there&#39;s a serious problem with the conflation of traditional AI, like predictive models and computer vision, with generative AI tools that chat, create images, and make music.

&quot;This analysis found that the overwhelming majority of AI climate benefit claims relate to &#39;traditional&#39; forms of AI rather than generative AI,&quot; Joshi wrote in the report.

Across the eight sources and 154 claims examined as part of the research, only four of them in any way related to generative AI systems and their potential to help the environment. In the other 150 cases, the language used in the data pointed to the deployment of traditional AI models as a potential source of climate solutions.

&quot;At no point did this search or analysis uncover examples where consumer generative systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Copilot led to a verifiable and substantial level of emissions reductions,&quot; Joshi wrote. &quot;However, much of the projected energy consumption of AI will stem specifically from &#39;generative AI,&#39; rather than more traditional forms of machine learning.&quot;

By generalizing their use of AI, companies claiming their systems would benefit the world they&#39;re polluting are pulling the wool over people&#39;s eyes, the report concludes, citing the coupling of traditional and generative AI in this context to be &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;false.&quot;

&quot;The benefits and harms exist in discrete technological domains; rendering the core &#39;net climate benefit&#39; defence of AI growth utterly implausible,&quot; the report concluded.

Along with conflating the potential climate benefits of using traditional AI with the far more energy-intensive and frequent deployments of generative AI datacenters, the report concludes that most of the evidence that even traditional AI would help with the climate crisis lacks support.

Of the 154 climate benefit claims that were examined in the study, only 26 percent cited published academic papers, and 36 percent lacked any citations for their claims at all. The remaining papers that included citations largely relied on corporate publications (29 percent), while the rest cited media reports, NGOs, institutions, and unpublished research papers.

Unsurprisingly, those corporate sources mostly &quot;did not include any primary assessable evidence or peer-reviewed and published academic work to support their claims,&quot; Joshi found.

All the while, the sources reviewed for the report (all of which are linked in the report for those curious) paint a picture of a future in which AI will solve the climate problems it is exacerbating.

&quot;Even the narrower, older forms of AI may be seeing an exaggeration and overstatement of their climate benefits, considering the lack of strong, peer-reviewed and verifiable evidence of their deployment in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the real world,&quot; Joshi noted. &quot;The narrative of a gigatonne-scale shift in global emissions that &#39;offsets&#39; the harm of generative AI is not supported by the results of this analysis.&quot;

If it&#39;s not claims that AI datacenters are going to be powered by next-gen nuclear followed immediately by admissions that all that current buildout is simply being powered by fossil fuels, it&#39;s just another form of greenwashing from the AI industry, it seems.

Joshi told The Register in an email that he was motivated to undertake this research after hearing Google persistently claim that its AI deployments would reduce emissions by 5 to 10 percent based on what he characterized as &quot;mind-bogglingly weak evidence&quot; that he considers &quot;one of the worst greenwashing claims I&#39;ve seen in a while.&quot;

As to what could be done to combat such widespread misinformation about the climate effects/benefits of AI, Joshi suggested those fighting to force honesty on the AI industry need to play the waiting game, to a degree.

&quot;The entire software class is leveraged on hype rather than effectiveness or usefulness and is arguably doomed either way,&quot; Joshi told us, echoing claims that AI is a bubble likely to burst at any time.

&quot;There is widespread public skepticism for what all of this is actually for, skepticism of the tech industry and bipartisan hostility towards destructive data centre developments,&quot; Joshi added. &quot;I would not underestimate how much public opinion is stacked on the side of us climate advocates and analysts.&quot;

Joshi said that the job of climate advocates in the current moment is to ensure that there&#39;s as little fossil fuel infrastructure built, and locked in to produce years of emissions, as possible.

He&#39;s not advocating action out of far left field, either: A growing number of US states are trying to pass moratoriums on new datacenter projects as activist demands pile up at the state and federal level. Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, which has earned public ire and a lawsuit over gas turbines being used to power a massive AI datacenter in Memphis, Tennessee, is now being looked at by state regulators unhappy with the situation.

In short, even with the AI industry claiming it&#39;s helping to solve a climate crisis of its own exacerbation, public opinion may be starting to turn.

We reached out to the IEA, Microsoft, and Google for comment on this story given how heavily they were featured in the report. The IEA didn&#39;t respond, Microsoft had no comment, and Google stood by its claims.

&quot;We stand by our methodology, which is grounded in the best available science. And we are transparent in sharing the principles and methodology that guide it,&quot; The Chocolate Factory told us. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir CEO Alex Karp has a singular mission to stand out among tech CEOs. Big talk on sales, profits, and tech potential is not enough. His gift for edgy one-liners takes him to places where execs of the past would have scarcely dared to go. Say hello to allusions to goose-stepping and innate Western superiority that we assume have audiences rolling in the aisles.

To get that much attention, he also needs to get about – much more than leaders of companies ten times the size of Palantir, it seems. Keeping him on the front pages of the business and investor media means Karp flies on &quot;non-commercial aircraft beneficially owned by him (the &quot;Executive Aircraft&quot;) for business and personal travel,&quot; according to a recent regulatory filing.

&quot;During the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company incurred expenses related to the use of the Executive Aircraft of $17.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively,&quot; it said.

Let&#39;s get that straight. Damn near $25 million on air travel in two years. That&#39;s enough to fly from London to New York and back about 44,000 times in an economy seat – depending on the commercial airliner – or every day for the next 100-plus years.

Karp has boasted that the company doesn&#39;t need to spend much on sales, as its products sell themselves once customers start playing around with them. Aside from this not being true – Palantir spent $1 billion on sales and marketing [PDF] in FY 2025 – the investment in Karp jetting around the globe to keep his mouth at the center of the action might yield significant ROI, even if his board would sometimes rather he remained a little less vocal.

An analyst from investment bank Jefferies put Palantir&#39;s investment in Karp&#39;s mobility into some perspective.

&quot;Assuming use of a mid‑sized jet with an estimated operating cost of ~$7K per hour, this implies roughly 2,457 flight hours, or about 28 percent of the year spent in the air,&quot; a recent note said, according to the FT.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, a $200 billion annual revenue biz, spends $1.8 million on air travel a year. Maybe meeting in the Metaverse makes it less necessary, though we doubt it. Palo Alto Networks&#39; CEO spends $2.4 million on private aircraft travel. His company&#39;s revenue generates $11 billion or so annually, compared to Palantir&#39;s $4.5 billion.

Perhaps, then, Karp is compensating for something. Or maybe, given his many extended flights of fancy, he just struggles to get down to Earth. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybersecurity researchers say they&#39;ve spotted the first Android malware strain that uses generative AI to improve performance once installed. But it may be only a proof of concept.

ESET calls it PromptSpy, malware whose primary goal is to deploy a VNC module that hands hackers remote control of infected devices.

The Slovak security shop&#39;s experts said PromptSpy comes with capabilities to instruct Google&#39;s Gemini chatbot to interpret parts of the device&#39;s user interface using natural language prompts.

These prompts allow the malware to examine the user interface, which then informs the gestures it needs to execute on the device in order to keep the malicious app pinned to its recent apps list.

Lukas Stefanko, malware researcher at ESET, said the use of GenAI amounts to only a small portion of the malware&#39;s toolkit, but allows it to adapt to different devices.

&quot;The AI model and prompt are predefined in the code and cannot be changed,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims.&quot;

Android malware usually relies on taps, coordinates, and UI selectors to execute tasks, but these have a tendency to break when running on different devices, which makes the use of Gemini a clever way to bypass this common issue.

PromptSpy submits a natural language prompt to Gemini, together with an XML dump of the device&#39;s current screen, and the chatbot returns JSON instructions for what action to perform and where to perform it to keep the app pinned in the user&#39;s recents list. This process repeats until Gemini tells PromptSpy that the app is in position.

ESET found versions of PromptSpy uploaded to VirusTotal in January, with the Gemini-assisted strains submitted from Argentina.

Analysis of the app&#39;s code suggests it was developed by Chinese speakers to assist financially motivated cybercriminals.

Stefanko said PromptSpy has not yet appeared in any of ESET&#39;s telemetry findings, suggesting it remains a proof of concept. However, the team found what appears to be a distribution domain, which could suggest it is being used to support real-world attacks.

The domains ESET investigated are now offline, but cached versions revealed they were likely trying to imitate a Chase Bank website.

PromptSpy is not on the Google Play Store, and given Google&#39;s recent clampdown on sideloading apps, it&#39;s unclear how the attackers planned to get the app loaded onto devices.

Once installed, the app can intercept lockscreen PINs or passwords, capture the pattern unlock screen as a video, record the screen and user&#39;s gestures, and take screenshots in addition to the Gemini interactions.

It also works to prevent the user from uninstalling the app or force-quitting it by placing transparent boxes over screen elements.

The boxes are invisible to the user, who would press the button&#39;s location on the screen, only for nothing to happen. The only way to uninstall it is to reboot the device in safe mode, where third-party apps are blocked, and then go through the usual uninstall routine.

&quot;PromptSpy shows that Android malware is beginning to evolve in a sinister way,&quot; said Stefanko. &quot;By relying on generative AI to interpret on‑screen elements and decide how to interact with them, the malware can adapt to virtually any device, screen size, or UI layout it encounters.

&quot;More broadly, this campaign shows how generative AI can make malware far more dynamic and capable of real‑time decision‑making. PromptSpy is an early example of generative AI‑powered Android malware, and it illustrates how quickly attackers are beginning to misuse AI tools to improve impact.&quot;

The finding follows ESET&#39;s work to unearth PromptLock, which it says is the first AI-powered ransomware payload.

As revealed in an interview with The Register, PromptLock&#39;s code was uploaded by the developers to VirusTotal, only to check if it would get past modern defense mechanisms.

A team of engineers at New York University worked up the code as part of a research project they hoped would land them a speaking spot at security conferences. The binary stayed in VirusTotal for some time before ESET found it.

Bemused when the news reports circulated following ESET&#39;s blog post outlining PromptLock, the NYU students contacted the Slovak security company to say that the malware was just a proof of concept.

Md Raz, one of the students and doctoral candidates behind PromptLock, &quot;couldn&#39;t believe it&quot; when he realized that people were writing about his work.

After receiving Raz et al&#39;s message, ESET updated a Xeet to note that its finding was a mere research project, one that wouldn&#39;t function outside of a lab.

&quot;This supports our belief that it was a proof of concept rather than fully operational malware deployed in the wild,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nonetheless, our findings remain valid – the discovered samples represent the first known case of AI-powered ransomware.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Job cuts at the IRS&#39;s tech arm have gone faster and farther than expected, with 40 percent of IT staff and four-fifths of tech leaders gone, the agency&#39;s CIO revealed yesterday.

Kaschit Pandya detailed the extent of the tech reorganization during a panel at the Association of Government Accountants yesterday, describing it as the biggest in two decades.

This happened as the Trump administration reshaped the federal bureaucracy last year with Elon Musk&#39;s DOGE wielding the chainsaw.

The IRS lost a quarter of its workforce overall in 2025. But the tech team was clearly affected more deeply. At the start of the year, the team encompassed around 8,500 employees.

As reported by Federal News Network (FNN), Pandya said: &quot;Last year, we lost approximately 40 percent of the IT staff and nearly 80 percent of the execs.&quot;

&quot;So clearly there was an opportunity, and I thought the opportunity that we needed to really execute was reorganizing.&quot;

That included breaking up silos within the organization, he said. &quot;Everyone was operating in their own department or area.&quot;

It is not entirely clear where all those staff have gone. According to a report by the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IT department had 8,504 workers as of October 2024. As of October 2025, it had 7,135.

However, reports say that as part of the reorganization, 1,000 techies were detailed to work on delivering frontline services during the US tax season. According to FNN, those employees have questioned the wisdom of this move and its implementation.

At yesterday&#39;s conference, Pandya said better outcomes had yet to be delivered. &quot;What it didn&#39;t lead to is automatically everybody coming together and working as one team. We just had different silos,&quot; he said. But his department had now set up &quot;cross-functional&quot; teams focused on end-to-end delivery of individual projects.

&quot;This way there isn&#39;t a cold hand-off of, &#39;My job is X, and now I&#39;m handing it off to somebody else,&#39;&quot; he said.

Ultimately, he said the aim was to have the IT group as a whole working toward a &quot;scorecard.&quot;

Naturally, AI is expected to play a significant role in all this, making people better at their jobs and more end-user-focused, he said.

However, Pandya said IRS leaders are telling employees that AI won&#39;t endanger their jobs. Clearly the agency is perfectly capable of getting rid of people the old-fashioned way.

The US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said last month the agency was behind in its efforts to digitize paper returns. It noted: &quot;The Information Technology function lost approximately 16 percent of its staff,&quot; who are responsible for updates for inflation and expiring or newly enacted tax provisions. This meant that &quot;according to the IRS readiness reports, implementation of these legislative changes is at risk for the 2026 Filing Season.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Meta is among tech giants reportedly funding US politicians friendly to the AI industry, as concerns mount over a huge expansion in datacenter building and the effects of AI on everyday life.

According to The New York Times, Meta is set to spend $65 million this year backing politicians who are sympathetic to its cause.

This is driven by concerns that its AI ambitions might be hampered by regulations intended to keep people safe, plus growing opposition from communities to giant data campuses popping up in their local area.

Meta is starting up two new super PACs (Political Action Committees – organizations to influence election outcomes), the NYT says, which will join two others it has already formed. One group, &quot;Forge the Future Project,&quot;, targets Republicans, while the second, &quot;Making Our Tomorrow,&quot; focuses on Democrats.

Zuckcorp isn&#39;t the only tech giant doing this, of course. The Los Angeles Times reported recently that Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech industry leaders stumping up $50 million for a new super PAC called &quot;Leading the Future.&quot; The PAC has similar aims in ensuring AI-friendly candidates prevail in the coming mid-term elections in the US.

It is perhaps a sign of the massive sums of money at stake in what many regard as an inflating AI market bubble.

The frenzy of interest in AI development has led to a boom in datacenter building to feed the demand for AI processing infrastructure. This in turn has met opposition from local communities, who are worried about issues including the impact on electricity bills and water supplies.

Research org Data Center Watch reports that 20 US server farm projects were blocked or delayed amid local opposition during Q2 2025.

Meta alone has revealed plans to build a number of multi-gigawatt datacenter clusters, one of which would cover much of the island of Manhattan in New York City.

The datacenter industry knows it has a public image problem, as discussed last year at the Datacloud Global Congress in Cannes, France. Perhaps not surprisingly, one solution touted is to get political leaders onside.

In the US, the situation has got bad enough that the Trump administration has stepped in to attempt to defuse public opposition through some sort of pact between the datacenter industry and hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI, establishing principles around energy, water use and community relations.

Washington is also determined to stamp out any regulations, particularly those at state level, that might constrain the AI industry. In December last year, President Trump issued an executive order intended to punish states that introduce any such legislation.

While individual states want to protect citizens from the effects of algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and security risks that might result from AI systems, Trump has empowered Attorney General Pam Bondi to set up an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge any state regulations that potentially hinder America&#39;s race for global AI dominance.

Financial analysts reported last year that the huge level of spending on AI was keeping the US economy out of recession, with datacenter infrastructure and model development providing the only significant growth. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/def_con_epstein_bans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybersecurity conference DEF CON has added three men named in the Epstein files to its list of banned individuals. They are not accused of any criminal wrongdoing.

Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito are the first names to be added to the shortlist this year, preventing them from attending any future conferences. Organizers said contact with the sex offender provided a rationale for the sanction.

All three are named in the Epstein files as having worked with, benefited from, or were otherwise tied to the disgraced financier during the prior decade, although as mentioned, they aren&#39;t accused of being involved in crimes.

The emails show that Holman and Epstein became acquainted as far back as 2010. Politico&#39;s reporting claimed that Epstein made plans to meet with the technologist in 2013, although it isn&#39;t clear if the sex offender actually attended.

Emails from the evidence bundle also appear to show that in the same year, Holman planned to stay at Epstein&#39;s residence in New York City, and introduced Epstein to other industry figures, including those who offered assistance to manipulate search results – burying bad news and promoting philanthropic efforts [PDF].

Holman currently works as a tech investor at venture capital firm Deep Future. He had not responded to The Register&#39;s request for comment at the time of publication.

Iozzo, who is the current CEO at identity management company SlashID and a former Black Hat board member, was in contact with Epstein between at least 2014 and 2018, the files indicate, offering to procure DEF CON tickets for him, emails show.

Iozzo sent a lengthy statement to Politico for its previous reporting on the files. The CEO said he was first introduced to the financier in 2014 while aged 25 and exploring funding opportunities for a startup.

He claims the allegations in the files were fabricated, that the FBI had never contacted him about his ties to Epstein, and that his interactions with Epstein were limited to business opportunities that never materialized.

A spokesperson to Iozzo told The Register: &quot;Mr Iozzo did not provide exclusive access to DEF CON or any other conference. In fact, Mr Iozzo has no idea if Epstein ever actually attended any conference. DEF CON is attended by tens of thousands of members of the public in any given year. DEF CON&#39;s actions are entirely performative, given that Mr Iozzo has barely attended the conference in the past twenty years. It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr Iozzo.&quot;

Vincenzo Iozzo told The Reg: &quot;I never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior. I regret the past association and take full responsibility for not exercising greater judgment at the time.&quot;

Joichi &quot;Joi&quot; Ito appears to be one of the individuals who introduced Iozzo to Epstein, according to emails in the DoJ&#39;s files.

&quot;Vincenzo is one of the best network security guys I know,&quot; Ito said in one May 2014 email. &quot;Working with him on a network security company idea. He&#39;s in NYC often. If you have time, you should connect. I think you&#39;ll enjoy meeting each other and I also think this business idea that we&#39;re working on might be interesting for you as well.&quot;

Ito, a venture capitalist currently serving as president of the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT), was in contact with Epstein between 2013 and 2019, emails show, and the two met numerous times during that period.

Epstein was an investor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#39;s Media Lab, where Ito formerly served as a director. Ito resigned from his post at MIT in 2019, The New York Times reported, after it was revealed that he had accepted $1.7 million from Epstein to help fund the lab.

Ito did not respond to The Register after we requested a statement via the CIT, but he previously apologized for his association with Epstein and claimed to have no knowledge &quot;of the horrific acts that he was accused of.&quot;

Readers who wish to examine the Epstein emails relevant to the three individuals now banned from DEF CON can do so at Jmail.world.

The project was set up by Luke Igel and Riley Walz. It ingests the raw email files included in the DoJ&#39;s poorly formatted dump of Epstein files and presents them in a Gmail-like interface.

Holman, Iozzo, and Ito join a list of individuals already publicly banned from DEF CON. The conference states that &quot;many bans&quot; are not revealed, and only six others have made the public list since 2017. ®

Packing multiple charging adapters can quickly eat up space, which is why an all-in-one travel adapter like the Baseus EnerCore CG11 makes for a good investment. The travel-friendly accessory works in most countries and lets you charge several devices at once, and right now, Amazon is offering it for $24.95 ($45 off) — its lowest price to date — when you use promo code G76S8NVM at checkout.

Baseus’ versatile adapter features four sliding plug types — Type A, Type C, Type G, and Type I — which retract when not in use, making it easy to pack. Together, they support outlets in more than 200 countries and regions, including the UK, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America. It features a USB-C and USB-A port, both of which deliver up to 60W of power, as well as a third 5W USB-A port for lower-power gadgets. That means you can charge a range of gadgets simultaneously, from smartphones and earbuds to the latest tablets. You can even charge beefier gadgets, including laptops, albeit at slower speeds.

Additionally, the universal travel adapter features a built-in, retractable USB-C cable with five preset lengths, which can extend up to 27 inches and deliver up to 70W of power. The palm-sized cube also weighs about half a pound, so it won’t add as much bulk to your bag as a bunch of chargers and adapters would. It lacks surge protection, too, so you can even safely bring it on board cruise ships.

Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses TP-Link of ‘masking its Chinese connections,’ while putting consumers at risk of cyberattacks.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing TP-Link over claims that the router-maker is misleading customers about its ties to China. In a lawsuit filed this week, Paxton claims TP-Link is “masking its Chinese connections,” while serving as “an open window for Chinese-sponsored threat actors and Chinese intelligence agencies.”

TP-Link was founded in China, but has attempted to distance itself from the country in recent years. In 2018, the company established a manufacturing facility in Vietnam, and then centralized its global headquarters in the US in 2024, forming TP-Link Systems.

Though TP-Link markets its routers and other products as “Made in Vietnam,” Paxton alleges that the company sources “nearly all” of the components used to manufacture these items from China. “The reality is that TP-Link continues to operate its supply-chain deep inside of China, with China’s support, and through Chinese exports,” the lawsuit claims. “The final touches TP-Link makes in Vietnam do not cure the company’s deceit of its Chinese affiliations.”

TP-Link’s ties to China have drawn closer scrutiny from the Trump administration, culminating in an investigation from the Federal Trade Commission, according to Bloomberg, and a probe opened by Texas in October. Texas alleges that TP-Link violates consumer protection laws by misrepresenting its products as “secure,” despite having alleged vulnerabilities, and misleading customers about its affiliation with China.

The Texas lawsuit against TP-Link is part of the state’s broader efforts to crack down on Chinese companies. On Wednesday, Paxton also filed a lawsuit against Anzu Robotics, a Texas-based drone company that he alleges is “misleading consumers about the origin, data practices, and security risks” of its devices. Paxton alleges Anzu’s devices are “rebranded” drones made by DJI, the China-based company that the Federal Communications Commission recently banned from importing new drones into the US.

Following an unexpected delay, the series is now slated to debut on March 4th.

The Hunt — Apple TV’s new French-language drama that was previously put on indefinite hold following concerns about plagiarism — has been given a solid release date.

Today, Apple announced that The Hunt, which was produced by French studio Gaumont and directed by Cédric Anger, is set to premiere on March 4th. The news comes after months of delays that began when French media reporter Clement Garin noted a number of striking similarities between The Hunt (which Anger originally sold as an original story of his own creation) and Shoot, Douglas Fairbairn’s 1973 novel about two groups of hunters, which was also adapted into a 1976 film.

Both The Hunt and Shoot revolve around a group of hunters who start to believe that another group of hunters are coming after them during an excursion out into the wilderness. Though The Hunt was originally scheduled to hit Apple TV on December 3rd, 2025, the plagiarism accusations prompted Apple TV to put the premiere on hold while Gaumont launched an internal investigation to determine how the production was able to make it so far along without anyone noticing its similarities to shoot.

In a statement to Deadline, Gaumont acknowledged that it has determined that The Hunt is “based on an existing work,” which is now being reflected in Apple’s most recent press release about the show. Apple refers to The Hunt as a “series by Cédric Anger based on the novel ‘Shoot’ by Douglas Fairbairn.”

“As soon as this information came to its attention, Gaumont, the series’ producer, immediately took the necessary steps to identify the rights holders, and obtain the required authorizations,” Gaumont said. “Respect for works and authors’ rights is a fundamental principle for Gaumont, which can only be exercised with the trust and transparency of creative artists.”

While Apple seems to have sorted out The Hunt’s situation, the streamer has yet to provide any real updates about The Savant, its previously announced crime drama about investigators fighting domestic terrorists whose premiere was postponed after the Charlie Kirk shooting. The Hunt may be a sign that Apple has been working to get its release slate back on track, but it might still be a while before The Savant sees the light of day.

﻿The lawsuit claims Apple has allowed iCloud to become a ‘secure avenue’ for storing and distributing CSAM.

West Virginia has filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of allowing the distribution and storage of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in iCloud. In a lawsuit filed on Thursday, West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey claims that by abandoning a CSAM detection system in favor of end-to-end encryption, iCloud has become a “secure frictionless avenue for the possession, protection, and distribution [of] CSAM,” violating the state’s consumer protection laws.

Apple initially outlined plans to launch a system that checks iCloud photos against a known list of CSAM images in 2021. The move was met with significant backlash from privacy advocates, with some claiming that the company is launching a surveillance system, leading Apple to stop the development of this feature nearly one year later. At the time, Apple’s software head Craig Federighi told The Wall Street Journal that “child sexual abuse can be headed off before it occurs... That’s where we’re putting our energy going forward.”

Now, West Virginia alleges Apple “knowingly and intentionally designed its products with deliberate indifference to the highly preventable harms.” McCuskey believes other states could take legal action against Apple as well, as he told reporters during a press conference that he thinks they’ll “see the leadership that this office has taken” and “join us in this fight.”

The lawsuit claims Apple made 267 CSAM reports to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, fewer than the over 1.47 million reports made by Google, and the more than 30.6 million made by Meta. It also cites an internal message between Apple executives, where Apple’s fraud head Eric Friedman allegedly states iCloud is the “greatest platform for distributing child porn.”

Many online platforms, including Google, Reddit, Snap, Meta, and others, use tools like Microsoft’s PhotoDNA or Google’s Content Safety API to detect, remove, and report CSAM in the photos and videos sent through their systems. Apple currently doesn’t offer these capabilities, but it has since rolled out some features focused on child safety, including parental controls that require kids to get permission to text new numbers, as well as a tool that automatically blurs nude images for minors on iMessage in other apps. But McCuskey argues that these safeguards aren’t enough to protect children.

“Apple has knowingly designed a set of tools that dramatically reduces friction for possessing, collecting, safeguarding, and spreading CSAM, all the while engineering an encryption shield that makes it much more likely for bad actors to use Apple to protect their illicit activities,” the lawsuit claims.

            <div id="article-text">The plan was to legalize limited robotaxi deployment outside of New York City. But it was dropped after failing to garner support with the state legislature.

The plan was to legalize limited robotaxi deployment outside of New York City. But it was dropped after failing to garner support with the state legislature.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) dropped her proposal to allow robotaxi companies to launch commercially in cities other than New York City, citing a lack of support among state legislators, Bloomberg reports today. The move is a blow to Waymo and other robotaxi companies who saw New York, and especially New York City, as a potential goldmine.

The plan, which was introduced by Hochul as part of the state’s budget proposal last month, would have allowed limited robotaxi deployment in cities other than the Big Apple — while leaving whether New York City would get autonomous vehicles up to the mayor and the City Council. But now that plan is DOA, as support in the legislature never materialized.

“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Sean Butler, a Hochul spokesperson, said in a statement.

The news is a setback for Waymo, which has been eyeing New York, and especially NYC, for years for the potential launch of its robotaxi business. According to Politico, Waymo spent at least $1.8 million since 2019 lobbying Hochul and state lawmakers, as well as city officials.

Waymo is currently testing its manually driven vehicles in the city under a permit granted under ex-Mayor Eric Adams’ administration, but that permit expires March 31st. The company is currently operating driverless ridehail services in six US cities, and has said it wants to launch in an additional 20 cities in 2026.

“While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement. “The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety.”

Under its current rules, autonomous vehicles are only allowed in New York with safety drivers who keep their hands on the steering wheel. The state law originally required a police escort, but a renewal of the law several years ago removed that language.

Other companies have attempted to crack open the NYC market, with little success. In 2017, Cruise announced plans to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but those plans were later scuttled with little explanation as to why. Boston-based Optimus Ride tested autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Mobileye, a division of Intel, also tested a couple of vehicles in the city.

Automakers and tech companies testing AVs tend to flock to states with friendlier regulations (like Arizona and Texas) or places that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California). New York is neither, but it does represent one of the biggest taxi markets in the world — and therefore is a ripe target for robotaxis.

Many modern gamepads have adopted a modular design in recent years, from the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded to Hyperkin’s clamp-on X5 Alteron for the Nintendo Switch. However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot, which is now on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).

The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.

As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

End of life decisions are difficult and distressing. Could AI help?End-of-life decisions can be extremely upsetting for surrogates—the people who have to make those calls on behalf of another person. Friends or family members may disagree over what’s best for their loved one, which can lead to distressing situations.David Wendler, a bioethicist at the US National Institutes of Health, and his colleagues have been working on an idea for something that could make things easier: an artificial intelligence-based tool that can help surrogates predict what the patients themselves would want in any given situation.Wendler hopes to start building their tool as soon as they secure funding for it, potentially in the coming months. But rolling it out won’t be simple. Critics wonder how such a tool can ethically be trained on a person’s data, and whether life-or-death decisions should ever be entrusted to AI.

            <h2>How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1132619/uncrewed-narco-subs-transform-columbian-drug-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”

That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.

Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.

Meanwhile, places like the Solomon Islands and Chad—low-lying or just plain sweltering—have emitted relatively little carbon dioxide, but by dint of their latitude and history, they rank among the countries most vulnerable to the fiercest consequences of global warming. That means increasingly devastating cyclones, heat waves, famines, and floods.

Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation for the homes that will be destroyed, the shorelines that will disappear beneath rising seas, and the lives that will be cut short. By one estimate, the major economies owe a climate debt to the rest of the world approaching $200 trillion in reparations.

Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. Even putting aside the jurisdictional problems, early climate science couldn’t trace the provenance of airborne molecules of carbon dioxide across oceans and years. Deep-pocketed corporations with top-tier legal teams easily exploited those difficulties.

Now those tides might be turning. More climate-related lawsuits are getting filed, particularly in the Global South. Governments, nonprofits, and citizens in the most climate-exposed nations continue to test new legal arguments in new courts, and some of those courts are showing a new willingness to put nations and their industries on the hook as a matter of human rights. In addition, the science of figuring out exactly who is to blame for specific weather disasters, and to what degree, is getting better and better.

It’s true that no court has yet held any climate emitter liable for climate-related damages. For starters, nations are generally immune from lawsuits originating in other countries. That’s why most cases have focused on major carbon producers. But they’ve leaned on a pretty powerful defense.

While oil and gas companies extract, refine, and sell the world’s fossil fuels, most of the emissions come out of “the vehicles, power plants, and factories that burn the fuel,” as Michael Gerrard and Jessica Wentz, of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center, note in a recent piece in Nature. In other words, companies just dig the stuff up. It’s not their fault someone else sets it on fire.

So victims of extreme weather events continue to try new legal avenues and approaches, backed by ever-more-convincing science. Plaintiffs in the Philippines recently sued the oil giant Shell over its role in driving Super Typhoon Odette, a 2021 storm that killed more than 400 people and displaced nearly 800,000. The case relies partially on an attribution study that found climate change made extreme rainfall like that seen in Odette twice as likely.

Overall, evidence of corporate culpability—linking a specific company’s fossil fuel to a specific disaster—is getting easier to find. For example, a study published in Nature in September was able to determine how much particular companies contributed to a series of 21st-century heat waves.

A number of recent legal decisions signal improving odds for these kinds of suits. Notably, a handful of determinations in climate cases before the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that states have legal obligations to protect people from the effects of climate change. And though it dismissed the case of a Peruvian farmer who sued a German power company over fears that a melting alpine glacier could destroy his property, a German court determined that major carbon polluters could in principle be found liable for climate damages tied to their emissions.

At least one lawsuit has already emerged that could test that principle: Dozens of Pakistani farmers whose land was deluged during the massive flooding events of 2022 have sued a pair of major German power and cement companies.

Even if the lawsuit fails, that would be a problem with the system, not the science. Major carbon-polluting countries and companies have a disproportionate responsibility for climate-change-powered disasters.

Wealthy nations continued to encourage business practices that pollute the atmosphere, even as the threat of climate change grew increasingly grave. And oil and gas companies remain the kingpin suppliers to a fossil-fuel-addicted world. They have operated with the full knowledge of the massive social, environmental, and human cost imposed by their business while lobbying fiercely against any rules that would force them to pay for those harms or clean up their act.

They did it. They knew. In a civil society where rule of law matters, they should pay the price.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.
