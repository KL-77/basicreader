            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Collecting fallen (or “shed”) elk antlers is a popular pastime in elk-heavy places like Montana, but it’s usually a pretty low-tech, on-the-ground affair. That’s why last year’s story about a US Black Hawk helicopter descending from the skies to harvest shed elk antlers on a ranch was such an odd one.

Was it really possible that US military personnel were using multimillion-dollar government aircraft to land on private property in the Crazy Mountains—yes, that’s their actual name—just to grab some antlers valued at a few hundred bucks?

In May 2025, Montana rancher Linda McMullen received a call from a neighbor. “He said, ‘Linda, there’s a green Army helicopter landed on your place, picking up elk antlers,’” McMullen told The New York Times last year. “I said, ‘Are you joking?’ He said, ‘I’m looking at them with binoculars.’”

The local sheriff, who said he was “still trying to figure all this out” at the time, added that this was “the first helicopter I’ve heard of” regarding shed antler collection.

The Adjutant General for the Montana National Guard, J. Peter Hronek, quickly issued a statement on Facebook “regarding unauthorized use of military aircraft.”

In it, Hronek said that he was “aware of an alleged incident involving a Montana Army National Guard helicopter landing on private property without authorization” and that “an internal investigation is underway, and appropriate adverse and/or administrative action will take place if the allegations are determined to be true.” The Black Hawk was apparently on a training flight at the time.

The three servicemen on the chopper were eventually charged in Sweet Grass County Court with trespassing. They all pleaded not guilty. This week, pilot Deni Draper changed his plea to “no contest,” allowing sentencing to go forward without a trial (but without actually admitting guilt).

According to local reporting, prosecutors had evidence that “no trespassing signs were posted on McMullen’s property” and that “Draper admitted to Montana game warden Austin Kassner that he piloted the helicopter and decided to land it.” In addition to the neighbor’s testimony, “helicopter tire indentations and exhaust marks in the grass” were present at the site of the alleged landing.

The judge has accepted the change of plea and hit Draper with a $500 fine—the maximum penalty. So long as Draper stays out of trouble for the next six months, he will avoid further fines and jail time.

As for the antlers themselves, they are currently held by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks but could go back to McMullen once cases against the other two servicemembers are resolved.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-chief-reviews-orion-heat-shield-expresses-full-confidence-in-it-for-artemis-ii/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WASHINGTON, DC—This week, NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, said he has “full confidence” in the space agency’s plans to use the existing heat shield to protect the Orion spacecraft during its upcoming lunar mission.

Isaacman made the determination after briefings with senior leaders at the agency and a half-day review of NASA’s findings with outside experts.

“We have full confidence in the Orion spacecraft and its heat shield, grounded in rigorous analysis and the work of exceptional engineers who followed the data throughout the process,” Isaacman said Thursday.

Isaacman has previously indicated that reviewing the heat shield issue early in his tenure, especially with the Artemis II mission due to launch in as few as four weeks, was a top priority. He met with senior agency officials about the matter within hours of being sworn in on December 18.

The private astronaut and billionaire entrepreneur has also said there should be more public transparency at NASA.

Following the Artemis I mission in November 2022, NASA was roundly criticized for its opaque handling of damage to Orion’s heat shield. The seriousness of the problem was not disclosed for nearly a year and a half after the Artemis I mission, when NASA’s Inspector General finally published close-up images of char loss—chunks of ablative material at Orion’s base that were intended to protect the spacecraft during its return but had fallen away.

To address these concerns, NASA tapped an “independent review team” in April 2024 to assess the agency’s investigation of the heat shield. This group’s findings were finalized in December 2024, at which time NASA formally decided to fly the Artemis II mission with the existing heat shield. Although NASA held a news conference to discuss its conclusions, a publicly released copy of the independent review team’s report was heavily redacted, creating further doubt about the integrity of the process. Some notable critics assailed NASA’s decision to fly on the heat shield as is and decried the ongoing lack of transparency.

That is more or less where the matter stood until a few days before Christmas, when Isaacman officially became NASA administrator.

After taking the job in Washington, DC, Isaacman asked the engineers who investigated the heat shield issue for NASA, as well as the chair of the independent review team and senior human spaceflight officials, to meet with a handful of outside experts. These included former NASA astronauts Charles Camarda and Danny Olivas, both of whom have expertise in heat shields and had expressed concerns about the agency’s decision-making.

For the sake of transparency, Isaacman also invited two reporters to sit in on the meeting, me and Micah Maidenberg of The Wall Street Journal. We were allowed to report on the discussions without directly quoting participants for the sake of a full and open discussion.

Convened in a ninth-floor conference room at NASA Headquarters known as the Program Review Center, the meeting lasted for more than three hours. Isaacman attended much of it, though he stepped out from time to time to handle an ongoing crisis involving an unwell astronaut on orbit. He was flanked by the agency’s associate administrator, Amit Kshatriya; the agency’s chief of staff, Jackie Jester; and Lori Glaze, the acting associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. The heat shield experts joined virtually from Houston, along with Orion Program Manager Howard Hu.

Isaacman made it clear at the outset that, after reviewing the data and discussing the matter with NASA engineers, he accepted the agency’s decision to fly Artemis II as planned. The team had his full confidence, and he hoped that by making the same experts available to Camarda and Olivas, it would ease some of their concerns.

What followed was a spirited discussion, with Camarda sparring regularly with the presenters and Olivas asking questions more infrequently. The engineering team in Houston, led by Luis Saucedo, went through dozens of charts and presented reams of data that had not been made public before.

“That level of openness and transparency is exactly what should be expected of NASA,” Isaacman said after the meeting.

Perhaps the most striking revelation was what the NASA engineers called “what if we’re wrong” testing.

At the base of Orion, there are 186 blocks of a material called Avcoat, individually attached to provide a protective layer that allows the spacecraft to survive the heating of atmospheric reentry. Returning from the Moon, Orion encounters temperatures of up to 5,000° Fahrenheit (2,760° Celsius). A char layer that builds up on the outer skin of the Avcoat material is supposed to ablate, or erode, in a predictable manner during reentry. Instead, during Artemis I, fragments fell off the heat shield and left cavities in the Avcoat material.

Work by Saucedo and others—including substantial testing in ground facilities, wind tunnels, and high-temperature arc jet chambers—allowed engineers to find the cause of gases becoming trapped in the heat shield, leading to cracking. This was due to the Avcoat material being “impermeable,” essentially meaning it could not breathe.

After considering several options, including swapping the heat shield out for a newer one with more permeable Avcoat, NASA decided instead to change Orion’s reentry profile. For Artemis II, it would return through Earth’s atmosphere at a steeper angle, spending fewer minutes in the environment where this outgassing occurred during Artemis I. Much of Thursday’s meeting involved details about how the agency reached this conclusion and why the engineers deemed the approach safe.

However, toward the end of the meeting, the NASA team agreed to discuss something that “no one really liked to talk about.” This was an analysis of what would happen to Orion if large sections of the heat shield failed completely during Artemis II. Formally, this is known as a “damage tolerance evaluation,” the engineers said. Informally, it’s known as “What if we’re wrong.”

The Avcoat blocks, which are about 1.5 inches thick, are laminated onto a thick composite base of the Orion spacecraft. Inside this is a titanium framework that carries the load of the vehicle. The NASA engineers wanted to understand what would happen if large chunks of the heat shield were stripped away entirely from the composite base of Orion. So they subjected this base material to high energies for periods of 10 seconds up to 10 minutes, which is longer than the period of heating Artemis II will experience during reentry.

What they found is that, in the event of such a failure, the structure of Orion would remain solid, the crew would be safe within, and the vehicle could still land in a water-tight manner in the Pacific Ocean.

“We have the data to say, on our worst day, we’re able to deal with that if we got to that point,” one of the NASA engineers said.

The composite layer beneath the heat shield is intended to withstand a maximum temperature of 500° F during reentry. During Artemis I, the maximum temperature recorded, despite the persistent cracking and char loss, was 160°. So any crew on board would have been safe. Even so, the heat shield damage was a serious concern because the agency’s modeling did not predict it.

After more than two years of testing and analysis of the char loss issue, the NASA engineers are convinced that, by increasing the angle of Orion’s descent during Artemis II, they can minimize damage to the heat shield. During Artemis I, as the vehicle descended from about 400,000 to 100,000 feet, it was under a “heat load” of various levels for 14 minutes. With Artemis II, this time will be reduced to eight minutes.

Orion’s entry profile will be similar for the first two and a half minutes, but afterward, the Artemis II entry will undertake a bit of a higher heat load than Artemis I for a couple of minutes. All of the agency’s modeling and extensive arc jet testing indicate this will produce significantly less cracking in the Avcoat material.

Much of the discussion Thursday delved into the technical minutiae of heat shields, tamp planes (the process of packing Avcoat into blocks), early char loss, spallation, and more. The discourse also revealed that one test in 2019, three years before Artemis I, indicated hints of the char loss later observed in flight. But this finding was not unequivocal, nor did it throw up a huge red flag at the time, the NASA officials said.

The message from Isaacman, Kshatriya, and other NASA officials at the meeting was clear. This heat shield was not perfect. If NASA knew several years ago what it knows now, the heat shield would be designed differently. It would be permeable to prevent the outgassing problems. Those changes are being incorporated into the Artemis III mission’s heat shield. There will be other tweaks to increase reliability.

Nevertheless, the agency is confident that flying the Artemis II heat shield on the revised profile is perfectly safe. In NASA jargon, such a rigorous justification that a space mission is safe to fly is known as flight rationale.

But why get to flight rationale at all? About 18 months ago, as the agency was narrowing in on the root cause of the heat shield issues, NASA’s leaders at the time, including Kshatriya, considered their options. They mulled the possibility of flying Artemis II in low-Earth orbit to test its life support equipment but not overly stress the heat shield. They thought about flying a second robotic mission around the Moon.

Perhaps most seriously, they considered moving forward with the Orion spacecraft (or at least its heat shield) that will be flown in Artemis III, which has permeable Avcoat, to be used for this mission. I asked Kshatriya on Thursday why they had not simply done this.

He gave a lengthy response, referring to CSM 2 (the crew service module, or Orion vehicle, for Artemis II) and CSM 3 (the Orion intended for Artemis III). The full audio is linked below.

“We had considered ‘let’s just pull forward CSM 3,’” he said, in part, “and essentially turn CSM 2 either into a test article or something else. Again, CSM 3 has unique capabilities, docking systems on it, right? We didn’t have a docking mode for that mission (Artemis II). CSM 2 could not be retrofitted with the docking system because of the uniqueness of the tunnel. Really, CSM 2 is kind of uniquely a free return vehicle because of the way it was designed initially. So the mods that would have had to be made for (Artemis) II and III to do that swap would have been too odious, and we wouldn’t have gotten the learnings. And, you know, we’re trying to get up hill as quickly as we can.”

Given all of this, how should we feel about this flight rationale, with Artemis II potentially launching in early February?

Over the last 18 months, I have had many discussions with experts about this, from mid-level engineers and current and former astronauts to senior leaders. I know definitively that the four Artemis II astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen, are comfortable with the decision. They did not feel that way at the beginning of the process. Wiseman, in particular, was quite skeptical. But they’ve been won over. Like almost everyone else who has reviewed NASA’s data at length, they accept the plan. Indeed, they are ready and eager to fly.

But what of the outside critics? That was the whole point of Thursday’s session. Could the NASA engineers convince Olivas and Camarda?

Olivas flew two Space Shuttle missions in 2007 and 2009 and has an advanced degree in materials science from Rice University. Before this week’s meeting, he had not gone public with his heat shield concerns. But he has been talking to me and another space reporter, Robert Pearlman, for about a month now.

Olivas is very credible on these issues. He was asked by the NASA leadership in late 2023, before the independent review team was formally named, to provide a second set of eyes on the space agency’s heat shield work. He saw all of the investigative data in real time. Although not formally a member, he sat in on the review team’s meetings through 2024 before that process ended. Afterward, he had some lingering questions he felt were unresolved by that process. A few weeks ago, he told Pearlman and me he would be reluctant to fly on Orion. It was a stunning admission.

Isaacman appeared to take these concerns seriously. In advance of Thursday’s meeting, he engaged with Olivas to hear him out and share information about what NASA’s engineers had done over the last 18 months to resolve some of the independent review team’s questions. These included char loss very early in Orion’s reentry.

After Thursday’s meeting, Olivas told me he had changed his mind, expressing appreciation and admiration for the in-depth engineering work done by the NASA team. He would now fly on Orion.

Camarda, another former shuttle astronaut, was less effusive. He has been very public with his criticism of NASA’s handling of the Orion heat shield. He told me in December 2024 that the space agency and its leadership team should be “ashamed.” Unlike Olivas, however, he has been on the outside the whole time. NASA had kept Camarda, 73, at arm’s length, and he felt disrespected. Given his credentials—the aerospace engineer spent two decades working on thermal protection for the space shuttle and hypersonic vehicles–Camarda could be a potent voice of skepticism leading up to the Artemis II launch.

After the meeting, I asked Camarda whether he felt any better about flying crew on the Artemis II heat shield.

“I would never be happy accepting a workaround and flying something that I know is the worst version of that heat shield we could possibly fly and hoping that the workaround is going to fix it,” Camarda said. “What I really hope he [Isaacman] gets is that if we don’t get back to doing research at NASA, we’re not going to be able to help Starship solve their problems. We’ve got to get back to doing research.”

But Camarda was no longer the firebrand he was at the outset of the meeting. Near its end, in fact, he even thanked the leadership team for being brought in, read in on the data, and allowed to have his say.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Poisoned arrows or darts have long been used by cultures all over the world for hunting or warfare. For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations.

Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene.

The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim’s respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest due to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.

According to the authors, up until now, the earliest direct evidence of poisoned arrows dates back to the mid-Holocene. For instance, scientists found traces of toxic glycoside residues on 4,000-year-old bone-tipped arrows recovered from an Egyptian tomb, as well as on bone arrow points from 6,700 years ago excavated from South Africa’s Kruger Cave. The only prior evidence of using poisons for hunting during the Pleistocene is a “poison applicator” found at Border Cave in South Africa, along with a lump of beeswax.

The authors sampled 10 quartz-backed arrowheads recovered from the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The results revealed that five of the 10 tested tips had traces of compounds found in Boophone disticha, aka gifbol (poisonous onion), sometimes called the century plant, which is common throughout South Africa. Various parts of the plant have been used as an analgesic (specifically a volatile oil called eugenol) as well as for poisonous hunting purposes. Its more toxic compounds include buphandrine, crinamidine, and buphanine; the latter is similar in effect to scopolamine and can cause hallucinations, coma, or death.

The new analysis specifically identified alkaloid residues of buphandrine and epibuphanisine. This cannot be a coincidence, per the authors. “If I speculate, Boophone poison was probably discovered by people eating the bulbs and then becoming sick or dying from it,” co-author Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg in South Africa told New Scientist. “The plant also has preservative, antibacterial, and hallucinatory properties, so that it is used in traditional medicine, and human deaths still occur as a result of accidental overdosing.”

The hunter-gatherers who made the arrow tips probably derived the poison from the milky bulb extract of a B. disticha plant. The thick liquid can be dried in the sun until it has a gum-like consistency, or reduced by heating it over a fire. Even small amounts of this substance have proven lethal to rodents within 30 minutes. In humans, it causes nausea, coma, flaccid muscles, rapid pulse rates, labored breathing, and edema of the lungs depending on the dosage. (Small doses can have medicinal effects.)

The authors note that poison arrows are not meant to kill instantly on impact. Rather, the intent is to pierce the skin just enough to introduce the poison into the bloodstream, with the arrowhead breaking off on impact and remaining under an animal’s skin. The wounded animal would then run for a day or more as the hunters continued to track it. This is evidence of complex cognition, per the authors, suggesting advanced planning, abstraction, and causal reasoning.

Historical 18th century records describe how the plant was used for hunting purposes, such as Carl Peter Thunberg’s account of native hunters using the root of B. disticha to poison arrows for hunting game like springbok. For comparison purposes, the authors also analyzed 250-year-old arrowheads found in collections in Sweden, brought back from South Africa by travelers. Those arrowheads also had traces of the same type of poison.

“Finding traces of the same poison on both prehistoric and historical arrowheads was crucial,” said co-author Sven Isaksson of Stockholm University. “By carefully studying the chemical structure of the substances and thus drawing conclusions about their properties, we were able to determine that these particular substances are stable enough to survive this long in the ground. It’s also fascinating that people had such a deep and long-standing understanding of the use of plants.”

            <h2>X’s half-assed attempt to paywall Grok doesn’t block free image editing</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/xs-half-assed-attempt-to-paywall-grok-doesnt-block-free-image-editing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Once again, people are taking Grok at its word, treating the chatbot as a company spokesperson without questioning what it says.

On Friday morning, many outlets reported that X had blocked universal access to Grok’s image-editing features after the chatbot began prompting some users to pay $8 to use them. The messages are seemingly in response to reporting that people are using Grok to generate thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children each hour.

“Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” Grok tells users, dropping a link and urging, “you can subscribe to unlock these features.”

However, as The Verge pointed out and Ars verified, unsubscribed X users can still use Grok to edit images. X seems to have limited users’ ability to request edits made by replying to Grok while still allowing image edits through the desktop site. App users can access the same feature by long-pressing on any image.

Using image-editing features without publicly prompting Grok keeps outputs out of the public feed. That means the only issue X has rushed to solve is stopping Grok from directly posting harmful images on the platform.

X declined to comment on whether it’s working to close those loopholes, but it has a history of pushing janky updates since Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter. Still, motivated X users can also continue using the standalone Grok app or website to make abusive content for free.

Like images X users can edit without publicly asking Grok, these images aren’t posted publicly to an official X account but are likely to be shared by bad actors—some of whom, according to the BBC, are already promoting allegedly Grok-generated child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) on the dark web. That’s especially concerning since Wired reported this week that users of the Grok app and website are generating far more graphic and disturbing images than what X users are creating.

It’s unclear how charging for Grok image editing will block controversial outputs, as Grok’s problematic safety guidelines remain intact. The chatbot is still instructed to assume that users have “good intent” when requesting images of “teenage” girls, which xAI says “does not necessarily imply underage.”

That could lead to Grok continuing to post harmful images of minors. xAI’s other priorities include Grok directives to avoid moralizing users and to place “no restrictions” on “fictional adult sexual content with dark or violent themes.” An AI safety expert told Ars that Grok could be tweaked to be safer, describing the chatbot’s safety guidelines as the kind of policy a platform would design if it “wanted to look safe while still allowing a lot under the hood.”

Updates to Grok’s X responses came after the platform risked fines and legal action from regulators around the world, including a potential ban in the United Kingdom.

X seems to hope that forcing users to share identification and credit card information as paying subscribers will make them less likely to use Grok to generate illegal content. But advocates who combat image-based sex abuse note that content like Grok’s “undressing” outputs can cause lasting psychological, financial, and reputational harm, even if the content is not illegal in some states.

That suggests that paying subscribers could continue using Grok to create harmful images that X may leave unchecked because they’re not technically illegal. In 2024, X agreed to voluntarily moderate all non-consensual intimate images, but Musk’s promotion of revealing bikini images of public and private figures suggests that’s no longer the case.

It seems likely that Grok will continue to be used to create non-consensual intimate images. So rather than solve the problem, X may at best succeed in limiting public exposure to Grok’s appalling outputs. The company may even profit from the feature, as Wired reported that Grok pushed “nudifying” or “undressing” apps into the mainstream.

So far, US regulators have been quiet about Grok’s outputs, with the Justice Department generally promising to take all forms of CSAM seriously. On Friday, Democratic senators started shifting those tides, demanding that Google and Apple remove X and Grok from app stores until it improves safeguards to block harmful outputs.

“There can be no mistake about X’s knowledge, and, at best, negligent response to these trends,” the senators wrote in a letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai. “Turning a blind eye to X’s egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”

A response to the letter is requested by January 23.

Whether the UK will accept X’s supposed solution is yet to be seen. If UK regulator Ofcom decides to move ahead with a probe into whether Musk’s chatbot violates the UK’s Online Safety Act, X could face a UK ban or fines of up to 10 percent of the company’s global turnover.

“It’s unlawful,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of Grok’s worst outputs. “We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all options to be on the table. It’s disgusting. X need to get their act together and get this material down. We will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”

At least one UK parliament member, Jess Asato, told The Guardian that even if X had put up an actual paywall, that isn’t enough to end the scrutiny.

“While it is a step forward to have removed the universal access to Grok’s disgusting nudifying features, this still means paying users can take images of women without their consent to sexualise and brutalise them,” Asato said. “Paying to put semen, bullet holes, or bikinis on women is still digital sexual assault, and xAI should disable the feature for good.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.24 of the Rocket Report! We’re back from a restorative holiday, and there’s a great deal Eric and I look forward to covering in 2026. You can get a taste of what we’re expecting this year in this feature. Other storylines are also worth watching this year that didn’t make the Top 20. Will SpaceX’s Starship begin launching Starlink satellites? Will United Launch Alliance finally get its Vulcan rocket flying at a higher cadence? Will Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket be certified by the US Space Force? I’m looking forward to learning the answers to these questions, and more. As for what has already happened in 2026, it has been a slow start on the world’s launch pads, with only a pair of SpaceX missions completed in the first week of the year. Only? Two launches in one week by any company would have been remarkable just a few years ago.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

New launch records set in 2025. The number of orbital launch attempts worldwide last year surpassed the record 2024 flight rate by 25 percent, with SpaceX and China accounting for the bulk of the launch activity, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Including near-orbital flight tests of SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy launch system, the number of orbital launch attempts worldwide reached 329 last year, an annual analysis of global launch and satellite activity by Jonathan’s Space Report shows. Of those 329 attempts, 321 reached orbit or marginal orbits. In addition to five Starship-Super Heavy launches, SpaceX launched 165 Falcon 9 rockets in 2025, surpassing its 2024 record of 134 Falcon 9 and two Falcon Heavy flights. No Falcon Heavy rockets flew in 2025. US providers, including Rocket Lab Electron orbital flights from its New Zealand spaceport, added another 30 orbital launches to the 2025 tally, solidifying the US as the world leader in space launch.

International launches… China, which attempted 92 orbital launches in 2025, is second, followed by Russia, with 17 launches last year, and Europe with eight. Rounding out the 2025 orbital launch manifest were five orbital launch attempts from India, four from Japan, two from South Korea, and one each from Israel, Iran, and Australia, the analysis shows. The global launch tally has been on an upward trend since 2019, but the numbers may plateau this year. SpaceX expects to launch about the same number of Falcon 9 rockets this year as it did last year as the company prepares to ramp up the pace of Starship flights.

South Korean startup suffers launch failure. The first commercial rocket launched at Brazil’s Alcantara Space Center crashed soon after liftoff on December 22, dealing a blow to Brazilian aerospace ambitions and the South Korean satellite launch company Innospace, Reuters reports. The rocket began its vertical trajectory as planned after liftoff but fell to the ground after something went wrong 30 seconds into its flight, according to Innospace, the South Korean startup that developed the launch vehicle. The craft crashed within a pre-designated safety zone and did not harm anyone, officials said.

An unsurprising result... This was the first flight of Innospace’s nano-launcher, named Hanbit-Nano. The rocket was loaded with eight small payloads, including five deployable satellites, heading for low-Earth orbit. But rocket debuts don’t have a good track record, and Innospace’s rocket made it a bit farther than some new launch vehicles do. The rocket is designed to place up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of payload mass into Sun-synchronous orbit. It has a unique design, with hybrid engines consuming a mix of paraffin as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Innospace said it intends to launch a second test flight in 2026. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Take two for Germany’s Isar Aerospace. Isar Aerospace is gearing up for a second launch attempt of its light-class Spectrum rocket after completing 30-second integrated static test firings for both stages late last year, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. The endeavor would be the first orbital launch for Spectrum and an effort at a clean mission after a March 30 flight ended in failure because a vent valve inadvertently opened soon after liftoff, causing a loss of control. “Rapid iteration is how you win in this domain. Being back on the pad less than nine months after our first test flight is proof that we can operate at the speed the world now demands,” said Daniel Metzler, co-founder and CEO of Isar Aerospace.

No earlier than… Airspace and maritime warning notices around the Spectrum rocket’s launch site in northern Norway suggest Isar Aerospace is targeting launch no earlier than January 17. Based near Munich, Isar Aerospace is Europe’s leading launch startup. Not only has Isar beat its competitors to the launch pad, the company has raised far more money than other European rocket firms. After its most recent fundraising round in June, Isar has raised more than 550 million euros ($640 million) from venture capital investors and government-backed funds. Now, Isar just needs to reach orbit.

A step forward for Canada’s launch ambitions. The Atlantic Spaceport Complex—a new launch facility being developed by the aerospace company NordSpace on the southern coast of Newfoundland—has won an important regulatory approval, NASASpaceflight.com reports. The provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador “released” the spaceport from the environmental assessment process. “At this stage, the spaceport no longer requires further environmental assessment,” NordSpace said in a statement. “This release represents the single most significant regulatory milestone for NordSpace’s spaceport development to date, clearing the path for rapid execution of Canada’s first purpose-built, sovereign orbital launch complex designed and operated by an end-to-end launch services provider.”

Now, about that rocket... NordSpace began construction of the Atlantic Spaceport Complex last year and planned to launch its first suborbital rocket from the spaceport last August. But bad weather and technical problems kept NordSpace’s Taiga rocket grounded, and then the company had to wait for the Canadian government to reissue a launch license. NordSpace said it most recently delayed the suborbital launch until March in order to “continue our focus on advancing our orbital-scale technologies.” NordSpace is one of the companies likely to participate in a challenge sponsored by the Canadian government, which is committing 105 million Canadian dollars ($75 million) to develop a sovereign orbital launch capability.

H3 rocket falters on the way to orbit. A faulty payload fairing may have doomed Japan’s latest H3 rocket mission, with the Japanese space agency now investigating if the shield separated abnormally and crippled the vehicle in flight after lifting off on December 21, the Asahi Shimbun reports. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency officials told a science ministry panel on December 23 they suspect an abnormal separation of the rocket’s payload fairing—a protective nose cone shield—caused a critical drop in pressure in the second-stage engine’s hydrogen tank. The second-stage engine lost thrust as it climbed into space, then failed to restart for a critical burn to boost Japan’s Michibiki 5 navigation satellite into a high-altitude orbit.

Growing pains… The H3 rocket is Japan’s flagship launch vehicle, having replaced the country’s H-IIA rocket after its retirement last year. The December launch was the seventh flight of an H3 rocket, and its second failure. While engineers home in on the rocket’s suspect payload fairing, several H3 launches planned for this year now face delays. Japanese officials already announced that the next H3 flight will be delayed from February. Japan’s space agency plans to launch a robotic mission to Mars on an H3 rocket in October. While there’s still time for officials to investigate and fix the issues that caused last month’s launch failure, the incident adds a question mark to the schedule for the Mars launch.

SpaceX opens 2026 with launch for Italy. SpaceX rang in the new year with a Falcon 9 rocket launch on January 2 from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Spaceflight Now reports. The payload was Italy’s Cosmo-SkyMed Second Generation Flight Model 3 (CSG-FM3) satellite, a radar surveillance satellite for dual civilian and military use. The Cosmo-SkyMed mission was the first Falcon 9 rocket flight in 16 days, the longest stretch without a SpaceX orbital launch in four years.

Poached from Europe… The CSG-FM3 satellite is the third of four second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed radar satellites ordered by the Italian government. The second and third satellites have now launched on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets instead of their initial ride: Europe’s Vega C launcher. Italy switched the satellites to SpaceX after delays in making the Vega C rocket operational and Europe’s loss of access to Russian Soyuz rockets in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. The rocket swap became a regular occurrence for European satellites in the last few years as Europe’s indigenous launch program encountered repeated delays.

Rocket deploys heaviest satellite ever launched from India. An Indian LVM3 rocket launched AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation direct-to-device BlueBird satellite December 23, kicking off the rollout of dozens of spacecraft built around the largest commercial communications antenna ever deployed in low-Earth orbit, Space News reports. At 13,450 pounds (6.1 metric tons), the BlueBird 6 satellite was the heaviest spacecraft ever launched on an Indian rocket. The LVM3 rocket released BlueBird 6 into an orbit approximately 323 miles (520 kilometers) above the Earth.

The pressure is on… BlueBird 6 is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s Block 2 satellites designed to beam Internet signals directly to smartphones. The Texas-based company is competing with SpaceX’s Starlink network in the same direct-to-cell market. Starlink has an early lead in the direct-to-device business, but AST SpaceMobile says it plans to launch between 45 and 60 satellites by the end of this year. AST’s BlueBird satellites are significantly larger than SpaceX’s Starlink platforms, with antennas unfurling in space to cover an area of 2,400 square feet (223 square meters). The competition between SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile has led to a race for spectrum access and partnerships with cell service providers.

Ars’ annual power rankings of US rocket companies. There’s been some movement near the top of our annual power rankings. It was not difficult to select the first-place company on this list. As it has every year in our rankings, SpaceX holds the top spot. Blue Origin was the biggest mover on the list, leaping from No. 4 on the list to No. 2. It was a breakthrough year for Jeff Bezos’ space company, finally shaking the notion that it was a company full of promise that could not quite deliver. Blue Origin delivered big time in 2025. On the very first launch of the massive New Glenn rocket in January, Blue Origin successfully sent a test payload into orbit. Although a landing attempt failed after New Glenn’s engines failed to re-light, it was a remarkable success. Then, in November, New Glenn sent a pair of small spacecraft on their way to Mars. This successful launch was followed by a breathtaking and inspiring landing of the rocket’s first stage on a barge.

Where’s ULA?… Rocket Lab came in at No. 3. The company had an excellent year, garnering its highest total of Electron launches and having complete mission success. Rocket Lab has now gone more than three dozen launches without a failure. Rocket Lab also continued to make progress on its medium-lift Neutron vehicle, although its debut was ultimately delayed to mid-2026, at least. United Launch Alliance slipped from No. 2 to No. 4 after launching its new Vulcan rocket just once last year, well short of the company’s goal of flying up to 10 Vulcan missions.

Rocketdyne changes hands again. If you are a student of space history or tracked the space industry before billionaires and venture capital changed it forever, you probably know the name Rocketdyne. A half-century ago, Rocketdyne manufactured almost all of the large liquid-fueled rocket engines in the United States. The Saturn V rocket that boosted astronauts toward the Moon relied on powerful engines developed by Rocketdyne, as did the Space Shuttle, the Atlas, Thor, and Delta rockets, and the US military’s earliest ballistic missiles. But Rocketdyne has lost its luster in the 21st century as it struggled to stay relevant in the emerging commercial launch industry. Now, the engine-builder is undergoing its fourth ownership change in 20 years. AE Industrial Partners, a private equity firm, announced it will purchase a controlling stake in Rocketdyne from L3Harris after less than three years of ownership, Ars reports.

Splitting up… Rocketdyne’s RS-25 engine, used on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket, is not part of the deal with AE Industrial. It will remain under the exclusive ownership of L3Harris. Rocketdyne’s work on solid-fueled propulsion, ballistic missile interceptors, tactical missiles, and other military munitions will also remain under L3Harris control. The split of the company’s space and defense segments will allow L3Harris to concentrate on Pentagon programs, the company said. So, what is AE Industrial getting in its deal with L3Harris? Aside from the Rocketdyne name, the private equity firm will have a majority stake in the production of the liquid-fueled RL10 upper-stage engine used on United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. AE Industrial’s Rocketdyne will also continue the legacy company’s work in nuclear propulsion, electric propulsion, and smaller in-space maneuvering thrusters used on satellites.

Tory Bruno has a new employer. Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin said on December 26 that it has hired Tory Bruno, the longtime CEO of United Launch Alliance, as president of its newly formed national security-focused unit, Reuters reports. Bruno will head the National Security Group and report to Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp, the company said in a social media post, underscoring its push to expand in US defense and intelligence launch markets. The hire brings one of the US launch industry’s most experienced executives to Blue Origin as the company works to challenge the dominance of SpaceX and win a larger share of lucrative US military and intelligence launch contracts.

11 years at ULA… The move comes days after Bruno stepped down as CEO of ULA, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture that has long dominated US national security space launches alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX. In 11 years at ULA, Bruno oversaw the development of the Vulcan rocket, the company’s next-generation launch vehicle designed to replace its Atlas V and Delta IV rockets and secure future Pentagon contracts.

A California spaceport has room to grow. A new orbital launch site is up for grabs at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Spaceflight Now reports. The Department of the Air Force published a request for information from launch providers to determine the level of interest in what would become the southernmost launch complex on the Western Range. The location, which will be designated as Space Launch Complex-14 or SLC-14, is being set aside for orbital rockets in a heavy or super-heavy vertical launch class. One of the requirements listed in the RFI includes what the government calls the “highest technical maturity.” It states that for the bid from a launch provider to be taken seriously, it needs to prove that it can begin operations within approximately five years of receiving a lease for the property.

Who’s in contention?… Multiple US launch providers have rockets in the heavy to super-heavy classification either currently launching or in development. Given all the requirements and the state of play on the orbital launch front, one of the contenders would likely be SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy rocket. The company is slated to launch the latest iteration of the rocket, dubbed Version 3, sometime in early 2026. Blue Origin is another likely contender for the prospective launch site. Blue Origin currently has an undeveloped space at Vandenberg’s SLC-9 for its New Glenn rocket. But the company unveiled plans in November for a new super-heavy lift version called New Glenn 9×4.

            <h2>“Ungentrified” Craigslist may be the last real place on the Internet</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/ungentrified-craigslist-may-be-the-last-real-place-on-the-internet/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing Internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company.

“There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.”

Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest Internet.

“The real freaks come out on Craigslist,” says Koester. “There’s a purity to it.” Even still, the site is a little tamer than it used to be: Craigslist shut down its “casual encounters” ads and took its personals section offline in 2018, after Congress passed legislation that would’ve put the company on the hook for listings from potential sex traffickers. The “missed connections” section, however, remains active.

The site is what Jessa Lingel, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has called the “ungentrified” Internet. If that’s the case, then online gentrification has only accelerated in recent years, thanks in part to the proliferation of AI. Even Wikipedia and Reddit, visually basic sites created in the early aughts and with an emphasis similar to Craigslist’s on fostering communities, have both incorporated their own versions of AI tools.

Some might argue that Craigslist, by contrast, is outdated; an article published in this magazine more than 15 years ago called it “underdeveloped” and “unpredictable.” But to the site’s most devoted adherents, that’s precisely its appeal.

“ I think Craigslist is having a revival,” says Kat Toledo, an actor and comedian who regularly uses the site to hire cohosts for her LA-based stand-up show, Besitos. “When something is structured so simply and really does serve the community, and it doesn’t ask for much? That’s what survives.”

Toledo started using Craigslist in the 2000s and never stopped. Over the years, she has turned to the site to find romance, housing, and even her current job as an assistant to a forensic psychologist. She’s worked there full-time for nearly two years, defying Craigslist’s reputation as a supplier of potentially sketchy one-off gigs. The stigma of the website, sometimes synonymous with scammers and, in more than one instance, murderers, can be hard to shake. “If I’m not doing a good job,” Toledo says she jokes to her employer, “just remember you found me on Craigslist.”

But for Toledo, the site’s “random factor”—the way it facilitates connection with all kinds of people she might not otherwise interact with—is also what makes it so exciting. Respondents to her ads seeking paid cohosts tend to be “people who almost have nothing to lose, but in a good way, and everything to gain,” she says. There was the born-again Christian who performed a reenactment of her religious awakening and the poet who insisted on doing Toledo’s makeup; others, like the commercial actor who started crying on the phone beforehand, never made it to the stage.

It’s difficult to quantify just how many people actively use Craigslist and how often they click through its listings. The for-profit company is privately owned and doesn’t share data about its users. (Craigslist also didn’t respond to a request for comment.) But according to the Internet data company similarweb, Craigslist draws more than 105 million monthly users, making it the 40th most popular website in the United States—not too shabby for a company that doesn’t spend any money on advertising or marketing. And though Craigslist’s revenue has reportedly plummeted over the past half-dozen years, based on an estimate from an industry analytics firm, it remains enormously profitable. (The company generates revenue by charging a modest fee to publish ads for gigs, certain types of goods, and in some cities, apartments.)

“It’s not a perfect platform by any means, but it does show that you can make a lot of money through an online endeavor that just treats users like they have some autonomy and grants everybody a degree of privacy,” says Lingel. A longtime Craigslist user, she began researching the site after wondering, “Why do all these web 2.0 companies insist that the only way for them to succeed and make money is off the back of user data? There must be other examples out there.”

In her book, Lingel traces the history of the site, which began in 1995 as an email list for a couple hundred San Francisco Bay Area locals to share events, tech news, and job openings. By the end of the decade, engineer Craig Newmark’s humble experiment had evolved into a full-fledged company with an office, a domain name, and a handful of hires. In true Craigslist fashion, Newmark even recruited the company’s CEO, Jim Buckmaster, from an ad he posted to the site, initially seeking a programmer.

The two have gone to great lengths to wrest the company away from corporate interests. When they suspected a looming takeover attempt from eBay, which had purchased a minority stake in Craigslist from a former employee in 2004, Newmark and Buckmaster spent roughly a decade battling the tech behemoth in court. The litigation ended in 2015, with Craigslist buying back its shares and regaining control.

“ They are in lockstep about their early ’90s Internet values,” says Lingel, who credits Newmark and Buckmaster with Craigslist’s long-held aesthetic and ethos: simplicity, privacy, and accessibility. “As long as they’re the major shareholders, that will stay that way.”

Craigslist’s refusal to “sell out,” as Koester puts it, is all the more reason to use it. “Not only is there a purity to the fan base or the user base, there’s a purity to the leadership that they’re uncorruptible basically,” says Koester. “I’m gonna keep looking at Craigslist until I die.” She pauses, then shudders: “Or, until Craig dies, I guess.”

            <div id="article-text">Thinking about dropping those flavorful white sachets of nicotine this resolution season? You might want to reconsider how fast you hit the off ramp.

Zyns — those tiny nicotine pouches that seem to nowinfest every urinal, bar-top, and sidewalk — have captured the hearts and mouths of many who would never consider smoking a cigarette, let alone packing ‘chaw. Since tobacco giant Philip Morris International acquired the Swedish brand for $16 billion in 2022, Zyn consumption among teens and young adults has nearly quadrupled, according to a November study by the CDC Foundation.

As it turns out, it’s much easier to start on the packs than it is to quit, especially if you go cold turkey. A horrifying profile by GQ details writer Rosecrans Baldwin’s effort to go from one 15-pouch can per day to none, virtually overnight. His experience was agonizing.

About four hours after deciding to lay off the nicotine lodes for good, Baldwin wrote that he began to experience dizziness, headaches, intense sweating, a rapid heart rate, clenching jaw, and even rolling hallucinations.

“For several hours, I’d been haunted by yellow-tinted hallucinations, sweeping in and out of my mind like searchlights, which told me I might’ve slipped between worlds,” he explained of his withdrawal experience. “The street was quiet and empty. I knew I shouldn’t stand, let alone go anywhere, in case the situation got worse.”

Little did he know at the time, Baldwin was in the throes of a panic attack, very likely brought about by acute nicotine withdrawal. “I was afraid I’d lost my mind,” he recalled.

In the US, Zyn sells its pouches in strengths varying from 3mg to 6mg. Though cigarettes contain anywhere from 10 to 12mg of nicotine, less than 2mg typically enters the body for each cigarette smoked, since a lot of the smoke drifts away. The absorption rate on nicotine pouches is much higher, as nicotine is delivered straight through the mouth’s mucous membranes and into the blood vessels.

Though Baldwin admits he’s long held a casual relationship with nicotine, he says Zyns took the habit to another level.

“Years went by when I didn’t smoke at all, and there were a few years when I smoked maybe a couple cigarettes a week,” he said. “My Zyn use turbocharged all of that, fostering a dependence I fed unwittingly, with a sachet secreting nicotine into every waking moment for more than a year.”

Baldwin’s first quitting attempt wasn’t successful, as he soon bought a pack of cigarettes and fell back into “nicotine’s grasp.” A while later, though, he decided to try again, this time by winding down his intake steadily over a few months — an effort which he says has finally freed him from the substance once and for all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chatbots may be explosively popular, but they’re known to dispense some seriously wacky— and potentially dangerous — health advice, in a flood of easily accessible misinformation that has alarmed experts.

Their advent has turned countless users into armchair experts, who often end up relying on obsolete, misattributed, or completely made-up advice.

A recent investigation by The Guardian, for instance, found that Google’s AI Overviews, which accompany most search results pages, doled out plenty of inaccurate health information that could lead to grave health risks if followed.

But seemingly unperturbed by experts’ repeated warnings that AI’s health advice shouldn’t be trusted, OpenAI is doubling down by launching a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which will ingest your medical records to generate responses “more relevant and useful to you.”

Yet despite being “designed in close collaboration with physicians” and built on “strong privacy, security, and data controls,” the feature is “designed to support, not replace, medical care.” In fact, it’s shipping with a ludicrously self-defeating caveat: that the bespoke health feature is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment.”

“ChatGPT Health helps people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness — while supporting, not replacing, care from clinicians,” the company’s website reads.

In reality, users are certain to use it for exactly the type of health advice that OpenAI is warning against in the fine print, which is likely to bring fresh new embarrassments for the company.

It’ll only be heightening existing problems for the company. As Business Insider reports, ChatGPT is “making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone,” to the dismay of legal and medical professionals.

Miami-based medical malpractice attorney Jonathan Freidin told the publication that people will use chatbots like ChatGPT to fill out his firm’s client contact sheet.

“We’re seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,” he said. “While that may be true, it doesn’t necessarily translate into a viable case.”

Then there’s the fact that users are willing to surrender medical histories, including highly sensitive and personal information — a decision that OpenAI is now encouraging with ChatGPT Health — despite federal law, like HIPAA, not applying to consumer AI products.

Case in point, billionaire Elon Musk encouraged people last year to upload their medical data to his ChatGPT competitor Grok, leading to a flood of confusion as users received hallucinated diagnoses after sharing their X-rays and PET scans.

Given the AI industry’s track record when it comes to privacy protection and struggles with significant data leaks, all these risks are as pertinent as ever.

“New AI health tools offer the promise of empowering patients and promoting better health outcomes, but health data is some of the most sensitive information people can share and it must be protected,” Center for Democracy and Technology senior counsel Andrew Crawford told the BBC.

“Especially as OpenAI moves to explore advertising as a business model, it’s crucial that separation between this sort of health data and memories that ChatGPT captures from other conversations is airtight,” he added. “Since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

“ChatGPT is only bound by its own disclosures and promises, so without any meaningful limitation on that, like regulation or a law, ChatGPT can change the terms of its service at any time,” Electronic Privacy Information Center senior counsel Sara Geoghegan told The Record.

Then there are concerns over highly sensitive data, like reproductive health information, being passed on to the police against the user’s wishes.

“How does OpenAI handle [law enforcement] requests?” Crawford told The Record. “Do they just turn over the information? Is the user in any way informed?”

“There’s lots of questions there that I still don’t have great answers to,” he added.

            <div id="article-text">Watch out, bartenders: your jobs might be next on the AI chopping block — at least if tech startup Breakreal has anything to say about it.

With CES 2026 in full-swing, tech insiders and industry journalists are getting a first-hand look at the madcap gadgets that research and development teams are forcing into the world. One of those devices is the Breakreal R1, a cocktail dispenser that its creators say is imbued with the power of a large language model.

A first-hand look at the device from Gizmodo‘s James Pero reveals what we can probably all intuit: the device is no match for a human bartender.

For starters, the liquid possibilities are pretty limited. Though the Breakreal website brags that R1’s “LLM-powered intelligence… distills your cravings into bespoke generative recipes” via “unlimited AI generated recipes,” the device can only hold eight cocktail ingredients at a time.

Consider a scenario where you load up ingredients to pump out a Manhattan — rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters — as well as a Vesper, which calls for gin, vodka, and Lillet Blanc. You only have two extra chambers left for auxiliary ingredients, and those first six don’t exactly blend well with each other.

The R1 is also “a bit slow,” Pero reports, taking 20 to 40 seconds to spit out a cocktail, some of which was leaking “out of the arm of the machine and not the nozzle.”

On top of all that, it’s incredibly expensive. According to Breakreal’s website, the R1 will retail for a mind-blowing $1,299 when it launches on Kickstarter at some point in the future. (At the moment, prospective buyers can currently get an early-access coupon to shave $300 off that price, bringing it down to $999.)

Compare this to the non-AI powered Bartesian cocktail machine, a similarly frivolous though much cheaper gadget currently going for just $349, and it’s difficult to imagine a world where R1 lasts very long.

Still, for $999, R1 buyers will get a cocktail maker with “LLM-powered interactive conversation” and “mood-sensing flavor adaptation” — which sound like word soup at best, and a sycophantic alcoholism machine at worst.

Luckily for those who do crave a connection with the entity making their cocktail, you can always trek over to a magical place: your local bar.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time ever, NASA has been forced to cut a mission to the International Space Station short due to a “serious medical condition” affecting a crew member.

The four Crew-11 astronauts, who arrived at the station in early August, will now be returning a month early on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. All four crew members must return together, since they all rely on the same spacecraft for transportation and a place to hide out in case of an emergency.

There’s a lot we still don’t know about what occurred. On Thursday, NASA held a news conference to discuss the situation, insisting that the crew member was “stable” and that “due to medical privacy,” it wouldn’t be “appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.”

The agency, however, revealed that the unidentified crew member did not sustain an injury and was “totally unrelated” to any space operations, including a Wednesday spacewalk that was unexpectedly cancelled.

Recently sworn-in NASA administrator Jared Isaacman made the announcement that the Crew-11 mission would be cutting their time on board the aging orbital outpost short. It’s likely the biggest decision he’s had to make during his extremely short tenure as the agency’s head.

More information about a more detailed timeline will be released within the next 48 hours.

“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” he said.

Polk also insisted that “because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergency evacuation.”

“We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down,” he added.

It’s a historic moment for the space station. Despite having been continuously inhabited since the year 2000, there has never been an early evacuation, as the BBC points out. According to Polk, early predictive models concluded a medical evacuation would happen once every three years — not 25.

“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said during Thursday’s conference. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”

Getting medical treatment in the cramped and microgravity environment of the ISS isn’t easy. Astronauts are highly trained for medical emergencies, but beyond being able to provide EMT-like treatment, options are limited, Ars Technica reports, options are limited.

“We have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don’t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete the workup of a patient,” Polk told reporters.

The ISS will have to continue operations with a much smaller crew of three after the departure of the Crew-11 crew. According to Isaacman, the subsequent Crew-12 mission may be moved up from its current February 15 date.

            <h2>NASA’s Library Shutdown Scandal Is Ballooning</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By March of this year, the Trump administration is hoping to shutter over a dozen buildings and more than 100 labs at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) in Maryland, the space agency’s first and oldest space center and a keystone for space research since around the time NASA was established in the late 1950s.

As part of its plans to gut the center, it shut NASA’s largest library at the GFSC last month, threatening to trash important documents in the process.

The news was met with outrage by NASA insiders, who pointed out that many of these historical documents remain undigitized, a scandal that has metastasized into the first major PR challenge for recently sworn-in NASA administrator and billionaire space tourist Jared Isaacman.

While agency officials have maintained that the move was part of a 2022 master plan — a “consolidation, not a closure” per NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens — and that researchers would continue to have access to the library’s archives as NASA teams conduct a 60-day review of all materials, GFSC staffers were taken aback at the abrupt and careless nature of the Trump administration’s actions.

“I feel like crying,” planetary scientist David Williams, who has curated space mission data for NASA’s archives, told NPR this week. “I mean, it’s horrible. I’m so frustrated. I’m so mad, and I’m just so upset.”

According to staffers interviewed by the broadcaster, the closures of buildings at Goddard were “rushed and disorganized, with no clear blueprint to replace important spaces.”

The approach has been reminiscent of the Trump administration’s vindictive approach to slashing agency budgets, as exemplified by Elon Musk’s bull-in-a-china-shop approach with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency last year.

NASA’s budget, in particular, has become a major target of the administration, with a proposed 2026 fiscal budget potentially cutting the agency’s science directorate budget by more than half, an “extinction-level event,” as characterized by critics. (Congress has since rejected Trump’s proposed cuts outright as NASA’s budget continues to be hotly debated.)

“The way that they’ve gone about it has just been extraordinarily haphazard and chaotic, and really to the point of being cruel to the people who work in these buildings,” Goddard operations research analyst Monica Gorman told NPR.

The library’s closure is only the latest in a string of what appear to be tumultuously implemented consolidation efforts. Gorman recalls “chaotic disruptions” and lab equipment being “treated carelessly.”

The agency has since attempted to pour water on the flames, with Isaacman accusing the New York Times of sensationalizing its reporting and mischaracterizing NASA’s plans to throw out undesirable documents currently being stored at the GSFC library.

“The [NYT] story does not fully reflect the context NASA shared,” he tweeted on January 2. “At no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

But NASA veterans and advisors say the Trump administration’s approach lead lead to  important documents being lost.

“Libraries and archives around the world are being ‘consolidated’ out of existence,” spaceflight engineering expert Dennis Wingo, who has advised NASA as a subject matter expert for decades, wrote in a reply to Isaacman. “I can tell you for an absolute fact that many of the people making the determinations on what is historically valuable or not are not qualified to do so.”

Lawmakers are equally taken aback by the gutting of the GSFC.

“NASA Goddard really is the crown jewel of the NASA facilities when it comes to space science,” senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MA) told NPR. “This administration is essentially doing things without letting the team at NASA Goddard know what their intentions are.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid a riotous AI hype cycle, companies are promising that their agentic AIs will —eventually, at least — do everything from your grocery shopping to booking your travel plans.

And what’ll you do with all that extra leisure time? Kick back and play some video games? Or will you deploy yet another AI to play the games for you, while you passively watch like the slack-jawed humans in “WALL-E”?

It might sound like parody, but Japanese tech giant Sony is looking to do exactly that: let an AI navigate PlayStation games on the human player’s behalf. According to a patent filed in September 2024 and surfaced by Video Games Chronicle, the company has plans for a “Ghost Player” that takes over the player’s character to puppet out the solution if they get stuck.

According to the patent, gamers would choose between a “Guide Mode” that shows an AI presenting the proper way forward or a “Complete Mode” that would simply assume control over the player’s character and play the whole thing on their behalf.

It’s an eyebrow-raising example of how companies are looking to use AI to essentially remove human agency, under the guise of making our lives easier. Gamers have turned to walkthroughs and hints for years, but usually after banging their own heads against difficult challenges, and hence learning something in the process.

Technically, accessibility options in video games are nothing new. Many modern titles allow gamers to adjust difficulty on the fly or even skip certain sections if things get too tricky. Sony’s PlayStation 5 console also has a Game Help system, which provides players with easily-accessed guides and hints mid-game.

Adding AI to that paradigm is clearly of interest to the gaming industry. Last year, Microsoft already introduced an Xbox “AI-driven sidekick,” called Copilot for Gaming, that can coach gamers to improve their skills. However, the large language model-based feature is limited to voice and text prompts.

On a broader scale, the use of AI in the video game industry has proven incredibly controversial. Many gamers have reacted with disgust to game studios using AI for creative tasks, like coming up with promotional artwork or generating character voices.

Nonetheless, company leaders like Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney have vowed to use AI in “nearly all future production.”

Whether companies will go as far as to introduce AI agents that play video games on behalf of players remains to be seen — but considering Sony’s patent, they’re certainly already thinking about it.

Gamers aren’t exactly optimistic about AI encroaching on the experience, especially amid deep confusion over how exactly developers and studios are looking to leverage the tech. In a piece for The Gamer, journalist Mike Drucker predicted that 2026 will be the “year that AI in gaming gets super annoying.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/meta-signs-deals-with-three-nuclear-companies-for-6-plus-gw-of-power/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S.

Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants.

Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.

Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.

The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.

The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.

As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.

TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.

The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.

Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.

The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.

Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children.

In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.

Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.

X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.

The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Andreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.

The firm, which employs approximately hundreds of people across five offices — three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. — has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.

That newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.

The “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio — the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history — the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.

The Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.”

But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration — not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.

This matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” — a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.

Then there’s the AI bet, which might be the firm’s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies).

The firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers.

In a blog post published Friday morning, Ben Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.”

Whether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money — $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.

Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.

The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop.

This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.

“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”

This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.

In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.

The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.

Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.

Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.

OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.

A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.

While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.

            <div id="article-text">After years of chatbots and image generators, AI is finally leaving the screen. At CES 2026, that shift became impossible to ignore.

The annual tech showcase in Las Vegas was dominated by “physical AI” and robotics, from Boston Dynamic’s newly redesigned Atlas humanoid robot to AI-powered ice makers (yes, really). The companies in attendance clearly want consumers to know: AI isn’t just capable of answering questions anymore. It’s ready to movecar parts in factories, catchcatching drones with net guns, and dance in automaker booths.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday’s Unveiled event.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

This family planning tool caught our eyes on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources, create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders, and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <h2>Trump’s Folly</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-mistake-venezuela-injustice/685560/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the 1970s, an ideological struggle within the Republican Party pitted the views of Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, against those of Ronald Reagan.

Kissinger, a brilliant, German-born statesman, embraced realpolitik—a pragmatic, power-based approach to foreign policy that downplays morality and ethics. Reagan believed that although realpolitik might be pursued by other nations, the concept was alien to the United States. He thought that it undermined American ideals, which were a source of strength and not a weakness. He promised that if he became president, he would place human rights and the expansion of human liberty at the center of his national-security strategy.

In 1983, Reagan called the Soviet Union an “evil empire.” Time and again he framed the Cold War, and America, in explicitly moral terms. His loathing for totalitarianism was among the very few hatreds Reagan ever held, his biographer Edmund Morris said.

During a May 1988 trip to the Soviet Union, he made a point of meeting with more than 100 dissidents. The New York Times reported at the time that senior Soviet officials complained that “a planned Presidential meeting with Soviet dissidents would be an unwelcome breach of superpower protocol.” Reagan’s determination to press the human-rights issue in Moscow “loomed as a potentially disruptive issue on the eve of his arrival,” the story said. “Moscow has traditionally resented what is seen here as an unwarranted and intrusive American assumption of moral superiority.”

Anne Applebaum: Trump has a new definition of human rights

No matter. For Reagan, America was a “shining city on a hill,” a moral example to the world. And even when America fell short, when its actions didn’t align with its ideals, when national interests overrode high-minded principles, its aspirations didn’t change. America’s ideals provided its people with a standard by which they could judge themselves.

America’s Founders conceived of America in a certain way, too. It was a novus ordo seclorum, a “new order for the ages,” at the core of which lay a universalistic ethic. Abraham Lincoln, America’s greatest Republican and one of its two greatest presidents, saw the nation in profoundly moral terms; he described it as the world’s “last, best hope.” And almost every president has understood, in one way or another, that America cannot be pried apart from its ideals and remain America. The ethic in some nations may be that might makes right, but not in the United States. Until Donald Trump, that is. Now everything is different.

Give Trump his due: He has never pretended to be something other than what he is in this area. His affinity for brutal dictators and authoritarian leaders—Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Viktor Orbán, Mohammed bin Salman, Rodrigo Duterte—is well known. During the 2016 campaign, when MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough said Putin “kills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries,” Trump replied, “At least he’s a leader.” Besides, Trump added, “I think our country does plenty of killing also.”

A year later, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly pressed Trump on his repeated expressions of respect for Putin. When O’Reilly described Putin as a killer, Trump responded, “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

It’s little wonder, then, that in his second term, a more liberated, less constrained Trump has repeatedly made it clear why he invaded Venezuela: He wanted its oil, and he was therefore entitled to seize it.

But it hardly ends there. A few days ago, Trump said invading Colombia “sounds good to me.” He’s hinted at using force against Mexico. Last year, he reiterated threats to “take back” the Panama Canal. He’s talked openly about making Canada America’s “51st state.” And Trump and his administration are now openly declaring they will seize, by military force if necessary, Greenland, a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, which was a founding NATO member.

“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,” Trump recently said, describing the region as “covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Since NATO was founded, in 1949, no member has attacked another. If that were to happen, it’s not clear that Article V, the collective-defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all and obligating other members to assist the attacked party, could successfully be invoked. But any such attack would surely destroy the greatest military alliance in history.

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

On Tuesday, major European allies, including Denmark, said in a joint statement they would “not stop defending” the values of sovereignty and Greenland’s territorial integrity.

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they said. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Republican Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee, in defending Trump’s stance on Greenland, referred to the United States as the “dominant predator” in the Western Hemisphere. He meant it as a compliment.

Earlier this week, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, Trump’s most influential adviser, was asked, “Can you rule out that the U.S. is ever going to try to take Greenland by force?” Miller responded by saying that the official position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.” He wouldn’t take military force off the table. But what was most notable was Miller’s articulation of the MAGA worldview.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else, but we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

In Donald Trump’s America, the law of the jungle rules. The strong do what they can; the weak do what they must.

A few days later, in an interview with the Times, Trump was asked if there were any limits on his global powers. “Yeah, there is one thing,” Trump said. “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”

Margaret MacMillan: This is the way a world order ends

That statement is worrisome on two levels. The first is that the man making it is the most powerful person in the world. He is also a malignant narcissist, consumed by hate and driven by vengeance. His mind is warped, his sense of morality corrupted. And yet his mind and his morality are the only checks on his power that he recognizes. Trump believes he is free to do whatever he wills. And it’s not at all clear who or what can stop him.

The second reason Trump’s statement is worrisome is that he has changed the United States in fundamental ways. He has not only pried America apart from its ideals; he has inverted them. For a decade, he has been the overwhelmingly dominant figure in American life, and he has reshaped how hundreds of millions of Americans—including the great majority of Republicans and evangelical Christians—think about right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice.

Many of the same people who once fiercely supported Reagan and opposed moral relativism and nihilism have come to embody the ethic of Thrasymachus, the cynical Sophist in Plato’s Republic who insists that justice has no intrinsic meaning. All that matters is the interests of the strongest party. “Injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more masterly than justice,” he argued.

The United States under Trump is dark, aggressive, and lawless. It has become, in the words of Representative Ogles, a predator nation. This period of our history will eventually be judged, and the verdict will be unforgiving—because Thrasymachus was wrong. Justice matters more than injustice. And I have a strong intuition and a settled hope that the moral arc of the universe will eventually bend that way.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/do-kids-need-palate-expanders/685556/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every night before bedtime, my daughter tilts back her head so that a pair of metal plates inside her mouth can be cranked apart another quarter of a millimeter. We turn a jackscrew with a wire tip; it spreads the bones within her upper jaw. At times she groans or even cries: she says that she can feel the pressure up into her nose.

This is normal. My daughter is 9 years old. She has a palate expander.

So does her best friend, and, by her count, so does nearly one in four of the kids in her fourth-grade class. On Reddit’s r/braces forum, a practitioner based in Frisco, Texas, said he was surprised by “how many parents ask me, ‘Hey, does my child need an expander? Everyone else seems to have one.’” His colleagues seemed to notice something similar. “Everybody’s being told they have a narrow jaw, and everyone&#39;s being given an expander,” Neal Kravitz, the editor in chief of the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, told me.

A generation ago, getting braces was a rite of passage into seventh grade. Today, the reshaping of a child’s smile may commence a few years earlier, at 7, 8, or 9 years old. At that point, the two sides of the upper jawbone haven’t yet joined together, a fact that is propitious for a different orthodontic process: instead of straightening, expansion. During this phase of life, when kids still have some baby teeth, a tiny dungeon rack may be wedged between a child’s upper teeth, then used to spread her upper jaw and—proponents say—introduce essential room for sprouting teeth.

The expander is an old device; debates about its use are hardly any younger. What seems to have been the first expander was described in 1860, in the journal The Dental Cosmos, by a San Francisco dentist named Emerson Angell. He wrote of “an apparatus, simple and efficient,” that he’d placed into the mouth of a young patient. Then he’d told her to expand it, day by day, by advancing a central screw—just as my daughter does today. But the journal’s editors were skeptical of Angell’s work. We “must beg leave to differ with the writer in the conclusion arrived at,” they announced in a prefatory note, foreshadowing a long disagreement within the field.

This concerned the merits of expansion versus those of extraction—whether a child’s jaw should be broadened to accommodate her teeth, or whether certain teeth should be pulled to accommodate her jaw. Around the turn of the 20th century, the influential orthodontist Edward Angle favored jaw broadening; he believed that all children should have their teeth intact, nestled in a capacious jaw, as exemplified by a human skull that had been ransacked from an Indian burial mound not far from where he practiced, which he called “Old Glory.” A few decades later, though, orthodontic research found that expanded jaws might still “relapse” into a narrow shape. By the 1970s, pulling teeth became the rule, Daniel Rinchuse, a Seton Hill University professor of orthodontics, told me.

This consensus was itself short-lived, he said—not because the field had come across some new and better mouth-expanding tech but because of fears about the supposed ill effects of doing too many extractions. Some dentists claimed that what was then the standard approach in orthodontics could even lead to painful disorders of the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ. In the face of these concerns, expanders made a comeback.

Eventually, some orthodontists started claiming that expanders had another major benefit—that prying open a child’s palate could improve her breathing and prevent sleep apnea. Some now recommend this airway-focused intervention not just for kids my daughter’s age but for toddlers too.

The basis for the trend was never really scientific, though. “Do expanders prevent obstructive sleep apnea? In capital letters: NO WAY,” Kravitz said. “There are endless research papers on this stuff.” The problem isn’t that expanders have no value, he continued; it’s that they’re clearly overused. According to Rinchuse, who co-edited the book Evidence-Based Clinical Orthodontics, the idea that extracting teeth will lead to joint disorders has never been proved. Indeed, no “high-quality evidence” supports expansion of the upper jaw for any reason, he said, except in cases where a child has been diagnosed with posterior “crossbite.” He said that, overall, orthodontic practice is less constrained by evidence than other fields of health care are, because the ill effects of bad decisions will be slight. As he put it, “In orthodontics, no one dies.”

Steven Siegel, the current president of the American Association of Orthodontists, acknowledged that some practitioners may be inclined to put a rack on every child’s palate: “There are some abuses,” he told me. But he also argued that the recent increase in expander use hasn’t really been dramatic, and that for the most part, the devices are used to positive effect. For people with a narrow jaw and crowded teeth, he said, expanders can prevent the need for extractions down the road; some kids, at least, could see improvements in their breathing. When I noted that I’d heard the opposite on both counts from Kravitz and Rinchuse, he responded that they simply disagreed. “I have great respect for both of them,” he said. “I would say that there is a controversy.”

For the record, my daughter is delighted by the treatment she’s received: In a recent family interview, conducted over breakfast, she described her course of orthodontics as “cool and fun.” Her orthodontist (who happens to be a former high-school classmate) has been thoughtful and communicative, and I’ve recommended her to several other families. Still, despite the fact that no one dies from orthodontics, one might also choose to avoid a treatment that costs several thousand dollars, has disputed benefits, and may cause modest pain—not to mention any moral injury that may accrue from tilting back your daughter’s head and cranking open metal plates to wrench her face apart.

And despite whatever caused expander mania, its existence can be jarring for a parent who grew up in the prior era of orthodontics. Indeed, the period during which this trend developed—from, say, the late 1980s until the early 2020s—happens to coincide with the stretch that intervened between my own entry into middle school and my daughter’s. For my fellow members of this cohort, expansion of the fourth-grade palate appears to be a strange and sudden social norm. During one visit to the orthodontist, my daughter and I found a handful of children about her age seated in a line of dental chairs, with technicians leaning over each of them to turn the screw of their expander. It was like we’d all gathered there for some initiation rite for children of the tribe that dwells on Cobble Hill in Brooklyn—a ritual of widening.

Not long after that, I called up Luke Glowacki, an anthropologist at Boston University who co-directs a research project in Ethiopia’s Omo Valley, where body modifications—and dental modifications in particular—are not uncommon. He told me about social groups there and elsewhere in which a child’s teeth might be filed down to points or a person’s lower lip stretched out with a plate.

Is orthodontics any different? It presents itself as curative and scientific, but many orthodontists’ websites are replete with beauty claims as well: An expander may “protect your child’s facial appearance” or provide “enhancement to the facial profile.” Siegel said that a broadened palate gives “a more aesthetic width of the smile.” Kravitz said that it could help shrink the unattractive gaps inside a person’s cheeks—“dark buccal corridors,” in the language of the field.

In East Africa, dental and other body modifications carry similar ambiguities of purpose. Filing down a person’s teeth, for instance, or removing them altogether “may also be done for ostensible health reasons,” Glowacki said. Some body-modification rituals could be understood to ward off harmful spirits, for example. In other words, they’re prophylactic. Glowacki also told me about a Nyangatom woman he knows who has scars carved into both her shoulder and forehead. The former are purely decorative, but she’d received the latter on account of being sick.

Glowacki is a parent, too, and I asked him whether his training as an anthropologist affected how he thought about expanders or other anatomical procedures, such as ear piercing, that are carried out on children in the United States at industrial scale. “You’re not gonna find any society in the world that doesn’t modify their body in some way in accordance with their ideas of beauty or of health,” he said. “We’re doing what societies all over the world do.” If now I’ve paid an orthodontist to reshape my daughter’s mouth, maybe that’s just human nature.</div>

            <h2>The Hole in Trump’s Rationale for Acquiring Greenland</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/pentagon-arctic-greenland-china-russia/685553/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have made a case for acquiring Greenland that’s so simple, even self-evident, it seems hard to refute: U.S. national-security interests in the Arctic are just too important to ignore. Not taking over the autonomous territory of Denmark would “give up the Arctic to China, to Russia, and to other regimes that don’t have the best interests of the American people at heart,” Vice President J. D. Vance declared last March during a visit to the Pituffik Space Base, on Greenland’s northwest coast.

Five years ago, Congress had a similar sense of alarm about Russia and China’s head start in exploring and potentially developing one of the world’s last great untapped regions, with its rich minerals, abundant (if icebound) seas, and strategic location almost connecting the continent of Europe with the northernmost reaches of the Americas.

The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act called for the creation of the Arctic and Global Resilience Policy Office at the Pentagon, which was set up in 2022. The office produced the Defense Department’s 2024 Arctic Strategy, dedicating Washington to increased Arctic defense capabilities, expanded collaboration with allies on Arctic security, and strengthened military readiness for Arctic operations.

The administration’s intense interest in acquiring Greenland, by force if necessary, might appear to be a natural outgrowth of the Pentagon’s work. Instead, it’s a clear repudiation of it. Not only has the demand for Greenland infuriated the same European allies on which the Arctic strategy depends, the Pentagon office itself has been quietly shuttered. In sum, even as the administration says it needs Greenland to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic, it has closed the office set up to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic.

The Arctic was a crucial strategic front in the Cold War, the shortest route for potential missile strikes and bomber flights. The United States and the Soviet Union maneuvered submarines in the region, competing for dominance at the top of the world.

A Cold War–era agreement allows Washington broad authority to conduct military operations on Greenland. The agreement, signed by Denmark and the United States in 1951, allows the U.S. to “construct, install, maintain, and operate” bases across the island, station personnel, and set the terms of “landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements, and operation of ships, aircraft, and water-borne craft.” Pituffik is the only current U.S. base.

As warming seas open new shipping routes and enable access to natural resources, the United States and its adversaries are again scrambling for position in the Arctic. China released a white paper in 2018 that declared itself a “Near-Arctic State,” using this characterization to assert its interests in the region. In 2020, Russia set a 15-year time frame for a set of aspirations in the Arctic, including the establishment of sovereignty over its northern sea route, the revitalization of Soviet-era military bases, and the creation of new commercial-shipping infrastructure. Russia has grown its fleet of icebreakers and other vessels needed to navigate the Arctic’s challenging conditions, and the Russian navy has held joint drills in the region with China, an ominous development for the United States.

The Pentagon’s Arctic office, in its short life, brought together agency leaders on policy planning to ensure that the government had the communication, intelligence, and surveillance tools for effective deterrence alongside allies with regional know-how. When Trump returned to power early last year, his team discussed restructuring the office, but the plans never materialized. It took too long to get leadership into place, especially Elbridge Colby, who wasn’t confirmed as undersecretary of defense for policy until April.

The office began a slow-motion demise as it shed personnel who were never replaced, three former U.S. officials told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. Around the time of the government shutdown last fall, the office effectively ceased to exist. The office’s website now leads to a 404 - Page not found! message. Some of the office’s functions have been moved to other parts of the government, but the number of people working on these issues at the Pentagon has been reduced by almost three-quarters, one of the former officials said. The office’s closure has not been previously reported.

One of the former officials we spoke with said the office was politically vulnerable because it was a creation of the Biden administration and focused in part on responding to climate change. The Pentagon has canceled climate-related programs and sought to weed out contracts and initiatives that even use the word climate. Last spring, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media that his department “does not do climate change crap.”

The policy office’s demise also reflects Trump’s interest in hemispheric dominance. Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson, in a statement, said that the office had not been shut down but rather “restructured to better align with the president’s priorities,” with work parceled out to the office of the assistant secretary responsible for homeland defense and the Americas. That puts strategy for U.S. interests around the North Pole together with Venezuela, the Panama Canal, and the Gulf of Mexico. The Pentagon last summer also shifted Greenland from U.S. European Command, responsible for Europe and Russia, to Northern Command, responsible for North America. An administration official told us the closure of the policy office was designed to achieve greater efficiency and noted that there is still an inter-agency team working on Arctic issues.

Meanwhile, Trump has yet to fill the role of ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, a position created in 2022 at the urging of Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who represents Alaska. Trump did, however, name Jeff Landry, a political ally and the governor of Louisiana, as special envoy to Greenland. Trump justified the appointment by recalling the Louisiana Purchase—the acquisition from the French of territory including land from 15 current states and two Canadian provinces, in 1803—and said Landry had approached him about the job. “He’s very proactive,” Trump told reporters. Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, told us Greenland would be “better served” if it were protected by the U.S.

In unveiling the Arctic strategy in 2024, senior Pentagon officials stressed international cooperation. Amanda Dory, at the time the acting undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that engagement with allies “underpins the whole document and is foundational to our approach to the Arctic.” She saluted “like-minded and highly capable allies” including Denmark, Norway, and two Arctic nations that were new NATO members, Finland and Sweden.

One former U.S. official based in an allied Arctic nation told us these partnerships were the best U.S. asset in the region. “We had great partnerships that were giving us everything we could ask for in the Arctic,” he said. “Going at it alone, we’re not the strongest power in the Arctic. So we gain less by behaving like a hegemonic power than we gained by working with the partners that were there.”

But recently, those alliances have been severely strained, if not broken. Trump’s repeated insistence on obtaining Greenland has prompted a furious reaction from European governments. In the long run, that may leave Washington less able to counter Russian and Chinese maneuvering in the Arctic—if that was indeed Trump’s aim in the first place. The president recently told The Atlantic that Greenland is “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships” (a claim that former officials described as unsupported by evidence), but the administration’s National Security Strategy, issued at the end of last year, seemed to shy from competition with U.S. adversaries in favor of maximizing economic gains. The document envisioned “strategic stability with Russia” and called for a “genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” It made no mention of the Arctic.

            <h2>Eat More Deer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/deer-hunting-venison-sale/685537/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The deer were out there. The crisp tracks in the snow made that clear. Three hours into our hunt through the frigid New Hampshire woods, Ryan Calsbeek, a rangy 51-year-old biology professor at Dartmouth, guessed that 200 animals were hiding in the trees around us. Calsbeek and I were 20 feet up a pignut hickory, crouching on a creaky platform. His friend Max Overstrom-Coleman, a stocky 46-year-old bar owner from Vermont, had climbed a distant tree and strung himself up by a harness, readying his crossbow and swaying in the wind. Shivering in camo jackets and neon-orange beanies, we peered into the darkening forest, daring it to move.

I had joined Calsbeek’s December hunt to try to get my hands on high-quality red meat. Calsbeek had yet to kill a deer that season, but in previous years, he told me, a single animal kept his family of four well fed through the winter. His young daughters especially liked to eat deer heart; apparently, it’s marvelously rich and tender. My mouth watered at the thought. The last time I’d tasted venison was more than a decade ago at a fancy restaurant in Toronto, where it was served as carpaccio, drizzled in oil and so fresh that it may as well have pranced out of the woods and onto my plate.

A bounty of such succulent, free-range meat is currently running through America’s backyards. The continental United States is home to some 30 million white-tailed deer, and in many areas, their numbers are growing too rapidly for comfort. Each year, a white-tailed doe can typically birth up to three fawns, which themselves can reproduce as soon as six months later.

Wherever deer are overabundant, they are at best a nuisance and at worst a plague. They trample gardens, destroy farmland, carry ticks that spread Lyme disease, and disrupt forest ecosystems, allowing invasive species to spread. They are involved in tens of thousands of car crashes each year in New York and New Jersey, where state wildlife departments have encouraged hunters to harvest more deer. In especially populated regions, wildlife agencies hire sharpshooters to cull the animals. Last year, New Hampshire legislators expanded the deer-hunting season in an attempt to keep the population under control. By the looks of the forest floor, which was pitted with hoof marks and scattered with marble-shaped droppings, that effort was falling short.

Over the past decade, some states have proposed a simple, if controversial, strategy for bringing deer under control: Couldn’t people like me—who don’t hunt but aren’t opposed to it—eat more venison?

Venison may not be a staple of American cuisine, but it has a place in many people’s diets. Health influencers laud it as a lean, low-calorie, nutrient-dense source of protein. Venison jerky sticks are sold at big-box stores and advertised as snacks for people on Whole30 and keto diets. Higher-end grocery stores, such as Wegmans and Whole Foods, sell ground venison for upwards of $12 a pound, roughly twice the cost of ground beef.

Part of the reason venison is so expensive is that most of it is not homegrown. It’s mostly imported from New Zealand, which has sent more than 5 million pounds of the stuff to the U.S. every year since 2020. Beef, the dominant red meat in the States, has historically been more affordable. But beef prices jumped nearly 15 percent in 2025, and the conventional kind sold in most supermarkets comes from cattle raised in abysmal conditions. If high-quality venison were cheaper and more widely available, it could be an appetizing alternative.

In recent years, a few deer-swamped states, including New Jersey and Maryland, have tried to legalize the sale of hunted venison, which would deliver two key benefits: more deer out of the ecosystem and more venison on people’s plates. Despite the sport’s association with trophies, many deer hunters are motivated by the prospect of obtaining meat, and they can only consume so much. “It’s for your own table,” Overstrom-Coleman said as he fixed climbing sticks onto a tree to form a makeshift ladder. He had already stocked his freezer full of venison this season (“That son of a bitch,” Calsbeek whispered, once we’d left our companion in his tree) and planned, as many hunters do, to donate any excess meat to a food bank.

Hunting is waning in popularity, in part because younger people are less keen on participating than older generations. Efforts to bring in more hunters, such as programs to train women and youth in outdoor skills, are under way in many states. Women are the fastest-growing demographic, and they participate largely to acquire food, Moira Tidball, the executive director at the Cornell Cooperative Extension who leads hunting classes for women, told me. Still, interest is not growing fast enough for the subsistence-and-donation system to keep deer numbers in check.

It’s hard to imagine a better incentive for deer hunting than allowing hunters to sell their venison to stores and restaurants. But the idea is antithetical to a core tenet of American conservation. For more than 100 years, the country’s wild game has flourished under the protection of hunters and their allies, steadfast in their belief that the nation’s animals are not for sale.

The last time this many white-tailed deer roamed America’s woodlands, the country didn’t yet exist. To the English colonists who arrived in the New World, the deer bounding merrily through the forests may as well have been leaping bags of cash. Back home, deer belonged to the Crown, and as such, could be hunted only by the privileged few, Keith Tidball, a hunter and an environmental anthropologist at Cornell (and Moira’s spouse), told me. In the colonies, they were free for the taking.

Colonists founded a robust trans-Atlantic trade for deer hide, a particularly popular leather for making work boots and breeches, which drastically reduced the deer population. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau notes a man who preserved the horns “of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity.” The animals were already close to disappearing from many areas at the beginning of what ecologists have called the “exploitation era” of white-tailed deer, starting in the mid-19th century. Fifty years later, America was home to roughly half a million deer, down 99 percent from precolonial days.

The commerce-driven decimation of the nation’s wildlife—not just deer but birds, elk, bears, and many other animals—unsettled many Americans, especially hunters. In 1900, Representative John Lacey of Iowa, a hunter and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt’s, introduced a bill to ban the trafficking of America’s wildlife. (As Roosevelt, who notoriously hunted to collect trophies, wrote in 1913, “If there is to be any shooting there must be something to shoot.”) The Lacey Act remains one of the most binding federal conservation laws in existence today.

From the May 1906 issue: Camping with President Theodore Roosevelt

The law is partly contingent on state policies, which make exceptions for certain species. Hunters in most states, for example, can legally harvest and sell the pelts of fur-bearing species such as otters, raccoons, and coyotes. But attempts to carve out similar exceptions for hunted venison, including the bills in Maryland and New Jersey, have failed. In 2022, the Mississippi attorney general published a statement that opened up the possibility of legalizing the sale of hunted deer, provoking fierce opposition from hunters and conservationists; today, the option remains open but has not led to any policy changes. Last year, an Indiana state representative introduced a bill that would allow the sale of hunted venison, but so far it has gone nowhere.

The practical reason such proposals keep failing is that allowing the sale of hunted meat would require huge investments in infrastructure. Systems to process meat according to state and federal laws would have to be developed, as would rapid testing for chronic wasting disease, an illness akin to mad cow that could, theoretically, spread to humans who eat infected meat, though no cases have ever been reported. Such systems could, of course, be implemented. Hunted deer is sold in some common grocery stores in the United Kingdom, such as Waitrose and Aldi. (Notably, chronic wasting disease is not a concern there.)

Read: Deer are beta-testing a nightmare disease

Although the sheer abundance of deer makes them easy to imagine as steaks on legs, several experts cautioned that some people’s affection for the animals runs deep. Deer are cute; they’re docile; they’re Bambi. David Drake, a forestry and wildlife professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, likens them to America’s “sacred cow.” As Drake and a colleague have outlined in a paper proposing a model for commercialized venison hunting in the U.S., any modern system would be fundamentally different from the colonial-era approach because it would be regulated, mostly by state wildlife agencies. But powerful coalitions of hunters and conservationists remain both faithful to the notion that wild game shouldn’t be sold and fearful that history will repeat itself. As the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a national hunting association, puts it, “Any effort to recreate markets for game species represents a significant threat to the future of our nation’s sportsmen-led conservation efforts.” Some of the fiercest pushback to the New Jersey law, Drake told me, came from the state wildlife agency.

The only U.S. state with a deer-related exception to the Lacey Act is Vermont. During the open deer-hunting season (which spans roughly from fall to winter in the Northeast) and for 20 days afterward, Vermonters can legally sell any meat that they harvest. This policy was introduced in 1961, and yet, “I am not aware of anyone who actually takes advantage of it,” Nick Fortin, a wildlife biologist at Vermont’s Fish and Wildlife Department, told me. He added that the department, which manages the exasperated homeowners and destabilized forests that deer leave in their path, has been discussing how to raise awareness about the law.

Even after I explained the 1961 law to several Vermont hunters, they were hesitant to sell me any meat. Hunted meat is meant to be shared freely, or at most bartered for other items or goodwill, Greg Boglioli, a Vermont hunter and store owner, told me. I met Boglioli at the rural home of his friend Fred Waite, a lifelong hunter whose front room alone was decorated with 20 deer heads. I had hoped to buy venison from Waite, but he insisted on sharing it for free. After all, he had plenty. His pantry was crammed with mason jars of stewed venison in liver-colored brine. On a table in the living room was the scarlet torso of a deer that his son had accidentally hit with his truck the other day, half-thawed and waiting to be cooked.

During our hunt, I found Overstrom-Coleman to be more open to the idea of selling the venison he hunted. “I guess that would be a pretty excellent way to share it,” he said. Earlier in the season, he’d killed a deer in Vermont, and he was willing to sell me some of the meat the next day. At least, I thought as I stared into the motionless woods, I’d be going home with something.

From the July/August 2005 issue: Masters of the hunt

By the time the sun went down, the only deer I’d seen was a teetering doe in a video that Overstrom-Coleman had taken from his tree and sent to Calsbeek. “Too small to kill,” he texted; he’d meet us in the parking lot. The air was glacial as Calsbeek and I trudged empty-handed toward the trailhead, hoofprints glinting mockingly in the light of our headlamps. From the trunk of the car, we took a consolation swig of Wild Turkey from a frosted bottle, and Overstrom-Coleman reminded me to visit the next day.

I found his chest freezer stuffed with paper-wrapped packages stamped with Deer 2025. He handed me three and refused to let me pay. Back home a few days later, I used one to make meatballs. Their sheer depth of flavor—earthy and robust, with a hint of nuttiness—made me wonder why I bothered to eat farmed meat at all.</div>

The transformation of ICE into a type of national police force, backed, in some cases, by soldiers from the National Guard, has been covered as immigration story—but these forces are reshaping democracy for all of us. This shift was evident even before the shootings in Minneapolis and Portland this week. In this episode, George Retes, a U.S. citizen and an Army veteran, recounts how he was detained by ICE and held for three days without explanation. The Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum returns as host of Autocracy in America and talks with Margy O’Herron and Liza Goitein from the Liberty & National Security Program at NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice about the potential impact of these forces on elections in November.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum.

Applebaum: In this new season, I am going to ask how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of US politics, and introduce you to some of the Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. The president and his entourage are accumulating power in ways that seem familiar to me: this is exactly how elected leaders in other countries have distorted their democracies. I want to understand how these kinds of changes work here, and what they bode for the future.

George Retes: My name is George Retes Jr. I’m 25 years old. I was born and raised here in Ventura, California. I’m a father of two, and yeah, I’m a U.S. citizen. The day I was arrested by ICE agents was July 10.

Applebaum: This first episode will focus on an issue you’ve probably heard about: the transformation of America’s immigration and customs officers into a masked and heavily armed paramilitary, and the deployment of the National Guard to American cities, supposedly to defend them. Americans may think of this as a change that mostly affects illegal immigrants, but this new federal police force is also establishing standards of lawlessness, and they are operating with an assumption of impunity that is changing the lives of U.S. citizens as well.

George Retes has already felt the impact.

Retes: I was driving to my workplace, where I work as a contracted security guard. When I pulled up, there’s just cars on that entire road, bumper-to-bumper—people getting out, just cars driving around each other. And I was like, All right, well, I just need to make it to work. So I make my way through, and it’s just this roadblock of ICE agents just standing across the road.

Retes: There’s people banging on trash cans and just yelling and stuff. I got out and I stood right by my car. I’m basically yelling at them, like, I’m a U.S. citizen. I’m a veteran. I’m just trying to get to work. I’m not protesting. I’m just trying to get to work. I thought everything was gonna be okay, and they just were hostile from the get-go.

Like, You’re not going to work today. Get back in your car. Leave. So I end up getting back in my car, and they just all start walking in a line towards me, and they just surround my car. I have the agents on the side trying to pull on my door handles, trying to open my car door, yelling at me to get out, and the agents in the front of my car are telling me to reverse, contradicting what these other agents are telling me to do.

They end up throwing tear gas. And I’m in there choking, trying to plead with them, like, I can’t see; my car’s engulfed in smoke, and eventually they hit my window again, and it just shatters. Immediately, the moment it shatters, another agent sticks his arm through and sprays me in the face with pepper spray.

They just dragged me out of the car, threw me on the ground. They just immediately kneeled on my neck and back. There’s maybe four or five other agents just standing around us, just watching as they do this. And the entire time, they’re just questioning, like, Why was he arrested? basically. Like, they were confused themselves.

Eventually, they put me back in this unmarked SUV, and then they end up driving me to the detention facility in downtown L.A. They strip-search us, they do our fingerprints, take our pictures. My hands are burning. My face is burning from tear gas still, and the entire time I was in there, no phone call, no lawyer, no shower. No nothing.

I was detained for three nights and three days. That Saturday was my daughter’s third birthday party, and that was probably the worst feeling ever. She’s my princess. It was just terrible.

So Sunday, a guard ends up coming up and is just like, You’re off, like, He’s getting released, and that’s all he says. That was it. They’re like, You’re free to go. All the charges had been dropped; you’re free to go. And I just asked them, “So I basically was locked up and missed my daughter’s birthday for no fucking reason?” And they just were silent. They just stayed silent. I was given no explanation, no apology, just: That’s it.

Retes: When I was locked up, just that entire time, I knew If I get out of here, I’m definitely gonna take legal action. I was gonna make my voice heard because that’s the only way to hold them accountable for what they did. Someone has to be held accountable. Treating people a certain way without dignity or respect or humanity is so fucking wrong. To not have any fucking rights, especially here in America, when that’s what we’re supposed to be all about—it’s wrong. It goes against everything we stand for. And so I hope that the justice system, even though I don’t believe it works all the time, I hope that in this case it works.

Applebaum: By one count from ProPublica, over 170 American citizens, like George Retes, have already been detained by ICE.

The unnecessary deployment of armed agents onto peaceful streets has also led to tragedy.

This week a woman was shot dead in her car by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Last September a man was shot and killed by ICE outside Chicago.

And last November, an Afghan refugee shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., and has been charged with the murder one of them, a 20-year-old woman from West Virginia. She had been deployed, frankly, for symbolic reasons, to demonstrate Trump’s control over the military, and over the nation’s capital, and she was murdered, it seems, because she served as a symbol of that American military power. The assailant has pled not guilty.

ICE, and the use of the National Guard to protect ICE, has been covered as immigration story, but America’s immigration and customs agents aren’t only being used for that purpose.

The Trump administration is also using ICE and the National Guard to project power, to demonstrate that it can operate without restraint, and in defiance of the law.

How is the deployment of these agents and soldiers legal? Has anything like this ever happened before? It seems any American can now be detained or harassed, or even killed. The American National Guard can be used as puppets in a presidential game—is that legal too?

I asked two experts from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU what we should be doing to secure our own safety, and to preserve our democracy. (We spoke before the killing in Minneapolis this week.)

Our first guest, Margy O’Herron, has documented the transformation of ICE. I started by asking her about the George Retes story and what ICE is supposed to do when it picks up a citizen. (And we should add here that ICE did not respond to questions from The Atlantic about the Retes case.)

Margy O’Herron: When ICE discovers that somebody is a citizen, they are supposed to release them right away. I think what you’re seeing, too, is just a bigger phenomenon of unchecked, chaotic deportation and arrest that is dangerous, and it risks all of our rights.

Applebaum: Okay, so citizens who are detained are supposed to have a certain set of rights, though even those now seem to be at risk. What about noncitizens?

O’Herron: There’s one key fact that I think is different, that I think is really important for folks to understand. And that is that the immigration system is considered a civil system. So this is not law enforcement in the sense of going after criminals. The great majority of immigrants in the system are actually only being charged with a civil offense, if anything, and that is: You are in the country without permission, and there is a civil process to remove you. Because of that, many of the rules that do apply in the criminal context, like right to counsel, do not apply in the civil context. But they’re operating much as if these folks are criminals. They’re arresting them. They’re detaining them. And the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment do still apply to immigrants. They apply to immigrants in the same way that they apply to citizens. There’s no distinction in the law. So without those things, ICE is arresting people and taking people out of the country without any kind of process, without alerting them that they’re going, without allowing them to talk to a lawyer—that is not lawful; it’s unconstitutional. Those rights exist, and they should be protected.

Applebaum: Trump’s big spending bill, which he called the One Big Beautiful [Bill] Act, will allocate over $170 billion to border and immigration enforcement, with a significant amount going to ICE. Can you give us some idea of the scale of the spending? What does it allow ICE to do that’s different from what Immigration [and Customs Enforcement] was allowed to do in the past?

O’Herron: Just to put it in context, it’s $170 billion over four years, but across the country, all states and local law enforcement, in a year, spent about $135 billion [in 2021]. And the money going to ICE is triple what they were authorized before. And what it means is that the types of raids that we’ve seen and the scale of detention that we’ve seen are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s going to increase significantly as they start spending all of those funds.

Applebaum:  Also, of course, all this funding is going to law enforcement, and very little is going to the judges or the immigration courts that for a long time have been the places where people targeted for deportation were allowed to state their case or make their arguments.

O’Herron:  Exactly right. So you see a 400 percent increase in detention and a 14 percent increase for the number of judges. We’ve also seen attacks on the immigration courts and immigration judges. The administration has fired more than 80 immigration judges, mostly for no cause. They’re claiming this is the right of the president to decide who’s an immigration judge. One assumes that they’re being fired because their positions or history or background is something that this current administration does not like. And they’re proposing now to replace those fired immigration judges with military lawyers. And although there are excellent lawyers in the military, they are not trained as immigration judges. And without that training, without that background, it suggests that there’s something else at work. And the fear will be that those judges are there to rubber-stamp the administration’s broader deportation agenda.

Applebaum:  As the money starts to get spent, what are some changes that all of us will see, that people not directly involved in immigration, immigration enforcement, or who aren’t immigrants themselves—what will we see? How will we be affected?

O’Herron: I think we’ll see increased raids and surveillance the way that we’ve seen things happening in Chicago and Los Angeles—roving patrols of ICE agents and also other law enforcement that’s been assigned to support ICE, right? So we now have: Customs and Border Protection, which is used to operating at the border, is supporting ICE. We also have more than 2,000 other federal law-enforcement agents—I think The Washington Post reported that 25 percent of FBI agents are now detailed over to do law enforcement of civilians in the immigration system. And that’s a huge shift from having law enforcement go after who we’d consider to be bad guys, to instead go after immigrants who have done nothing except enter the country unlawfully. And even the number of people that have entered the country unlawfully is lower than the number of people that they’re arresting. Of the folks that are being arrested, 70 percent have absolutely no criminal background, and of the folks that do, there is a very slim number that have any kind of violent criminal background. Most have property crimes or—

Applebaum: Parking tickets, I read in one case.

O’Herron: Parking tickets, even. Correct. And so you’ve taken your FBI agent who’s well trained to go after a drug trafficker or child predator, and instead you have them going after a landscaper or a guy who works at the car wash—to go after civilians.

Applebaum: If this is illegal, if it breaks existing laws, why can’t courts seem to stop this kind of behavior?

O’Herron: I think the courts have been stopping this behavior, or at least they’re trying. There have been some really important rulings out of both Chicago and Los Angeles, which is where we’ve seen a lot of violence against immigrants in the last few months. A district court in Los Angeles, for example, ruled that ICE could not arrest immigrants without reasonable suspicion and couldn’t rely on certain factors, like race and speech, to support that reasonable-suspicion determination. That order was stayed by the Supreme Court, unfortunately. But in the intervening period, while the court’s order was in effect, those orders were followed.

Applebaum: But it’s not stopping them from continuing to arrest people.

O’Herron: Well, I think there is a sense from the top that the agents who are taking these actions are not gonna have any consequences for those actions. For example, there was a video that circulated quite broadly of a woman who was pushed by an ICE agent outside the New York immigration office. She was shoved across a hallway, and she fell. She ended up being hospitalized. Initially, ICE came out with a statement that said that type of action was unacceptable, but a few days later, it was reported that that ICE agent was back on the job.

The administration also has cut many of the oversight offices that are supposed to be places that compile and check that kind of abuse. These are really important offices that field thousands of complaints every year on exactly this kind of behavior. And instead, now we have to rely on the courts exclusively to take these actions.

Applebaum: Taking a step back, it seems that what you are saying is that we are granting a heavily armed federal police force permission to break the law with impunity. They are not punished for either illegal or unethical actions, and no one is keeping track.

O’Herron: You can still file a complaint with ICE. And even though that may seem like a futile exercise, it is really important for tracking what is happening. Those records are then available by [the Freedom of Information Act]. They’re available to Congress. They will be available to some future administration to be able to identify what has happened and provide redress.

Applebaum: It looks to me like the nature of immigration enforcement is changing, that it’s beginning to look something a lot more like the War on Terror.

O’Herron: Yeah, I think that’s right. What we now see is a very heavy, militarized law-enforcement presence with very little oversight. You’ve got ICE agents and their law-enforcement partners using—they’re dressed like military soldiers. They are using military weapons. They are rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters. They’re using flash-bang grenades to clear out buildings.  They’re zip-tying the elderly, children as a way of evacuating a building. These are tools that are used by armed soldiers against enemies—not that we use against civilians.

So I do think there is an effort to terrorize, to intimidate, and probably to get people to self-deport or to not come in the first place. And I think it also is an effort to enforce this narrative that we’re going after the worst of the worst. That has been the line that the administration has been using, but that’s not what they’re actually doing. By making it look like they need all of this backup, they need this heavy-duty equipment, it suggests that that is in fact what they’re doing. But the data does not support that claim.

Applebaum: So they’re trying to convince people that this is a real military operation against real terrorists. They even made a recruiting video out of the raid that deployed Black Hawk helicopters, making it seem something like the Marines in Iraq. But even that raid, it was allegedly meant to target a Venezuelan gang, and yet no one who was detained appears to be a member of a gang, or even a criminal. So it seems that it’s ordinary people.

O’Herron: Correct. Being pulled out of, you know, in the middle of the night to sit in the cold and wait for a chance to say that they’re a citizen.

Applebaum: We’ve been talking about ICE, but that is only one aspect of the new military presence on America’s streets. The other is the National Guard.

Liza Goitein: To me, a police state is a place where the presence of, whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement, is so heavy that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

Applebaum: In addition to ICE, President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard in several big cities. I’ve seen them hanging around Metro stops in Washington, D.C., fully armed, which I find very jarring. I asked my second guest, Liza Goitein, also of the Brennan Center, whether there are any precedents for this.

Goitein: No president has used the military domestically in the way that President Trump is using the military.

Goitein: Never. For street crime? In our nation’s history, presidents have deployed troops to quell civil unrest or to enforce the law a total of 30 times. And the last time was in 1992, so over 30 years ago.

So what we’re seeing now, not only has Trump deployed the military into American cities three times in just over eight months in office, compared to 30 times in the nation’s entire history before this, but he’s also doing it in circumstances where it just hasn’t been done this way before.

Applebaum: Right, so neither is the state asking for help, nor is the state acting in violation of federal law. So there’s no—none of the excuses that have ever been used before are being used.

Goitein: Exactly. I mean, the only time I think the military has been used for street crime was in Hawaii during World War II when Congress authorized martial law. And Hawaii wasn’t a state at the time. Having said that, the law is—it’s 10 USC § 12406. I wish it had a catchy name.

Goitein: It doesn’t. Okay, so I’m just gonna call it Section 12406. And that’s a law that allows the president to federalize National Guard forces. Now, this law has never been used to deploy troops to quell civil unrest, at least not on its own. He’s using it in an unprecedented way.

Applebaum: And he’s doing so on the grounds that there’s an emergency, right? He’s claiming he’s claiming emergency powers. There’s a very bad tradition of leaders using emergencies to do things that are illegal. I mean, it goes back to the 1930s and earlier.

Goitein: Well, yeah, and it’s a hallmark of authoritarian regimes around the world, because emergency powers free leaders from legal constraints that they would otherwise face. And so there’s obviously a temptation to either exploit real crises or to manufacture crises in order to act without these legal limits.

Right. Of course the president has already used exaggerated claims about “unrest,” and therefore “emergency,” in Portland to try to justify the use of troops there, possibly after being shown outdated video. Historically, wars have also given leaders an excuse to crack down on protest or to claim emergency powers. You know in the run up to the U.S. incursion into Venezuela, I did wonder whether the purpose was to create a reason for the president to declare an emergency. Which leads me to the next question, which is whether the military is now at risk of becoming a political tool, used by the White House, not to defend Americans from their enemies, but to promote the President’s power or status and to punish his enemies.

Goitein: When soldiers are dragged into what is widely perceived to be a domestic political fight, that this—first of all, it’s really bad for the morale of the soldiers. That’s not why they enlisted. They don’t like being dragged into politics. But also, it undermines public trust in the military. When you do that, that really weakens our military, when it cannot appeal to and draw from all sectors of the U.S. population, when it loses the public confidence.

And you have to worry about the long-term effects on the military in terms of who is going to join up and who’s going to stay in the military. And increasingly, are we going to see that the people who enlist, the people who stay in the military, are people who either agree with the president’s political agenda, agree that the military should be used to police fellow Americans, or at least are okay with the military being used in that way? And that would very fundamentally and dangerously change what our military is.

Applebaum: Yeah. One of the sources of legitimacy of the U.S. military is that it is perceived as bipartisan, and it is perceived as an institution that protects all of us. And so, presumably, if it loses that, then it loses some of its legitimacy in the eyes of Americans.

Goitein: Absolutely. And that’s really one of the main dangers of what’s happening now that I think not enough people are focused on.

Applebaum: Let me ask you a different question about the future: Do you think, as some governors have warned, that the deployment of armed forces on our streets—National Guard, ICE, and others—will be used to shape public opinion in the run-up to midterm elections this year and maybe during the elections themselves?

Goitein: Yeah, there’s certainly a risk that the president would attempt to deploy troops around the time of an election on the theory that people are less likely to come out and vote if they think that the streets are gonna be full of, you know, heavily armed, federal law enforcement or military troops. That’s going to dissuade some people from getting out and exercising the right to vote.

You really have to worry that not only that this is happening so often—we’re seeing a routinization of the use of the military domestically—but also that we’re seeing a real creep in terms of what it’s being used for. So first it started with protests against ICE raids that were supposedly interfering with ICE’s ability to conduct those raids. Then it was general crime control in Washington, D.C., and you have to wonder what the next reason is going to be. Now, it might continue for a while to be crime control or, you know, protests. But the next reason could be claims of voter fraud, which is a phenomenon that is statistically almost nonexistent.

Applebaum: So you could imagine ICE or the military being used to police polling stations?

Goitein: Well, no, they can’t be used to police polling stations. No. The law very explicitly says that U.S. military and federal armed agents cannot be present at polling stations unless force is necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States. We do have these very strong laws in place that prohibit interference with elections generally and specifically by the military. So that’s off the table. Or at least if they were to do it, it would be flagrantly and obviously illegal.

Applebaum: So technically, we have laws on the books that should prevent troops from being used inside a polling booth. But this administration has already demonstrated that it’s willing to break laws. And maybe, one of the purposes of troop deployment in cities is just to create a general climate of fear, to make people afraid to participate in public life?

Goitein: I mean, it’s certainly the predictable effect of deploying the military on the streets on a sort of routinized basis—to change people’s behavior so that they are afraid to exercise their rights, so that they do behave differently.

So my concern is that we’re moving towards a status quo in which the cities of this country really feel like police states. And to me, a police state is a place where the presence of—whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement—is so heavy and the chill on people’s exercise of their rights is so acute that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

I personally know several people who are U.S. citizens or immigrants who are lawfully in this country, who have told me that they are staying inside as much as they can, and not going out unless they have to.

Goitein: To me that kind of chill and that kind of change in behavior is what really marks life in a police state.

If it&#39;s anything like where my girlfriend works, the managers are probably working from home.

A bad manager makes it unbearable. That&#39;s regardless of stupid company policies like this.

As a manager myself, my company wants me to use various metrics to monitor my team. They even helpfully provide tools to collect those metrics. Frankly, I&#39;m just not interested. I know my team, I know they&#39;re good at what they do, and I know they care about their work. If I ever look at metrics, it&#39;s because I already know there&#39;s a problem, and I need to jump through HR hoops to take action.

The idea is presumably to reduce management to metrics and then the managers can be replaced with AI agents.

It&#39;s dumb, but some MBA will make a ton of money when he exercises his stock options.

Just don&#39;t commit anything you haven&#39;t reviewed or don&#39;t thoroughly understand.

Exactly this, the review process already exists and it exists for a reason.If code is crap it will get rejected, it doesn&#39;t matter wether it was barfed out by an LLM or typed out manually by an inexperienced human programmer.

Exactly,  code is either correct, standards complaint, efficent, understandable, and licensed appropriately or it fails at being one or more of those things. Linus and the other maintainers are not about to start accept patches they don&#39;t like, understand, or lack proper attribution / documentation.

So it really does not matter what the authoring process was, be how we normally think programmers work, the result of long conversations with inanimate plastic ducks, debates with the resident house cat, or the r

Umm... since the kernel is GPL v2 specifically, doesn&#39;t it matter a lot what the license of the code generated is? What is the licensing status of the training data and does that directly affect the output? I feel like it does.

Either it meets the high standards required by the kernel team or it doesn&#39;t.   It doesn&#39;t matter if it was written by AI, aliens or Linus himself.

I use AI tools when coding and I&#39;ve used it to generate code at times, but I read through it with a fine-toothed comb, test it thoroughly, and don&#39;t commit anything I don&#39;t 100% understand.  I think anyone working on the kernel is easily capable of the same thing.

This is it exactly. There&#39;s not even any point to trying to figure out whether it&#39;s idiot-generated slop or AI-generated slop. Just figure out whether or not it&#39;s slop, and then reject it if it is.

I just saw an AI video about what if Harry Potter was raised by the Weasleys. Typical AI slop.  Not worth viewing.  The kind of thing that makes you hate the AI companies

This was not a &#39;real&#39; song, they made it up. Probably the AI wrote it, but it turned out fantastic.  It is emotional and enough to make an orphan cry.  The kind of song that could become a hit if it was sung by a real singer.

If you want to hear it,  I suggest you close your eyes while listening to it because the visuals are not worth it.  But the song is worth hearing.

The reason it is alive today, isn&#39;t in spite of itself. It is alive because it is exactly what it has ALWAYS been.

Functions exactly as it should.Hasn&#39;t chased bigger metrics.Hasn&#39;t deviated from core goals/values.Provides service as advertised (pun intended).Stayed out of politics.

The perfect role model for business longevity.

Many of the listings are less than half as busy as they were 10-15 years ago, at least in the nearest major metro to my locale.

Yeah unfortunately Facebook Marketplace has really eaten into it&#39;s share of the local selling game.

I mean that&#39;s kindof the whole thing right there isn&#39;t it and this applies to so many things.

We have 2 platforms, one is fairly closed source, AI ridden, privacy invading, etc and one is low-key, hands off and privacy respecting but the user experience and user base overrides those greater philosophical concerns.

And that&#39;s nothing about judgement, you the buyer want to get the stuff you want to get wherever it is, it&#39;s just a greater reminder of how business works and what people value and reward.

Where were you posting? As far as I know CL isn&#39;t really used as a request forum but one for service providers have to pay to advertise.  I post stuff for sale all the time for free.

https://www.craigslist.org/abo... [craigslist.org]

Also for that type of thing, &quot;who wants to cut my lawn today?&quot; Nextdoor is really useful honestly

Being from the Bay Area, I was an early Craigslist user.   Used it to find multiple apartments, furniture and other items as a 20-something in the 90s, and sell a few things here and there that did not make sense on Ebay.   It was a really great thing, especially when the only real alternative at that time was newspaper classifieds.

The other day I was looking for an inexpensive musical keyboard, and I was having trouble with Facebook Marketplace listings because most of the sellers didn&#39;t respond to inquiries about their ads.  (this seemed particular to the type of item I was looking for, I&#39;ve not generally had trouble with other stuff.)  So I thought, &quot;I wonder if anyone still uses craigslist&quot; and sure enough, plenty of listings.   I contacted one and went to pick it up later the same day.   Reminds me to check there for anything else I am looking for as well.

Unlike just about every other online business today, Craigslist is a completely honest, straightforward business.  There is no hidden toll or price (your data) for &#39;free&#39; (they make revenue elsewhere) and the transaction is straightforward for buyer and seller.  No upsells to a paid version.  No AI.   Unlike many early sites, the founders did not sell out and continued to be satisfied with the existing level of income provided rather than the temptation of a large payout up front, enjoying a first-mover advantage with a lot of good will and brand recognition.  Somehow, no one came and ate their lunch.  It just kept going, year after year after year.    How many sites do you remember becoming enshittified after being sold to a large corporation?   Craigslist is a super rare example of what happens when you don&#39;t sell out.

It would be fun if an AI and data mining backlash spurred a bunch of new &#39;old school&#39; sites with honest, straightforward dealings.  I guess one can dream...

Bought a nice yamaha G-60A made-in-japan 1968 classical guitar off craigslist.  Cleaned up real nice.

Found a job in it once, too.  My worst IT job, and I stayed only a year, but it sure beat the convenience store I was working at, at that time.  2016-2018 was really rough on me.

I&#39;d rather CL than Marketplace or Mercado Libre or whatever.

Not everything requires flash and dash and java and popups and dancing red peppers.

While there are some outstanding bugs, and occasional floods of spam, the site mostly just works as intended.  They only recently (maybe in the last year ?) made javascript required.

I just wish more people would use it instead of defaulting to stuff like Facebook marketplace, but that&#39;s a personal convenience thing...

Sadly, the &quot;javascript required&quot; part seriously turned me off to it.  Why must sites keep doing this?  What functionality on CL that worked fine 30 years ago now requires JS?  Sadly, this has made the site largely unusable for me as I browse with NoScript, so I haven&#39;t been on nearly as much recently as I was back in the day.

Funny how the article on Ars-Technica lauds Craigslist for having no ads while their own site is heavy with them.

I see people have translucent effects in Windows.  It might even be a default these days?  I recall having to turn it off on my computer at work.  Looking at it for even just a few seconds gives me a headache.  I don&#39;t understand the appeal, but then again I&#39;ve always been more about functionality than eye candy.

How to undo a lot of Appleâ(TM)s mistakes:

Settings > Display > Liquid glass > &quot;Tinted&quot;.

I don&#39;t see any &quot;Classic&quot; option when I pull down the top right menu?

1. Open Phone App2. Select &quot;Recents&quot; tab3. Select the menu in the upper right

And that way is by only making future security updates available in OS 26 for devices that support it.

So next time there&#39;s an important security update that everyone should have, those with a device running OS 18 that is capable of also running OS 26 will only have that security update available as a OS 26 upgrade only, and not available as a point release update for OS 18 for those devices.

My phone is OK but my watch often takes a few seconds to respond. It&#39;s also now harder to read notifications on the watch because of the &#39;glass&#39; nonsense which puts pretty graphics above actual functionality.

I have a new iPhone 17 Pro, so I have no choice but to run iOS 26.   I can say I now fully regret this upgrade.   They sold this on AI, which was an embarrassing failure; the Liquid glASS is something I can live without, it doesn&#39;t add anything useful -- the new Safari experience is completely trashed, unintuitive.    If I would install/run iOS 18 on this device, I probably would.

As a long-time Apple user, I am really concerned about their future, if they don&#39;t get their act together.

I would think liquid glass also introduces more processing power and reduces battery life slightly.

... memory [slashdot.org] does iOS 26 need?

I use X tools, and a lot of enterprise software - I am totally OK with bad UI.

But the Liquid Glass crap is just appallingly bad. Text overlapping blurry text, things out of alignment, weird motion for no reason - just garbage.

The other phone and my Mac will sit this one out.

Specifically to avoid the liquid ass update.

Liquid glass. It&#39;s visually neat and I&#39;m sure the programmers are very proud of themselves but the novelty has worn off. In some cases the liquid glass UI elements have poor contrast because of whatever background might be beneath, and the UI transitions are too slow for my liking. Sometimes liquid buttons can join together due to simulated surface tension (e.g. top-right in the photo app &#39;library&#39;)... neat but was this really necessary? I guess it was.Software bloat is like a gas - it expands to fill its c

Siri is still crap.Yup - they spent all this time on Liquid Ass and no time on making any actually useful fixes.Guess this is what we can start expecting from multi-$trillion dollar companies with thousands of &quot;engineers&quot; housed in multi-$billion campuses.

Version 26.2 should&#39;ve been called &quot;Marathon Edition.&quot;

People hated the Frutiger Aero era of Microsoft design. Nobody wants it on their phone. Apple needs to get back to making innovative products instead of shoehorning stuff into the hardware and software just so they have something to advertise.

Top 5 is done every week at my company. And if you have a good reason that it&#39;s less than 5, that&#39;s ok too. The semiannual performance review is similar, but with self and peer evaluations. And going over 5 is okay too.

it works well for sales and customer service that have discrete repeatable tasks and keep metrics. or other people with well defined jobs.

less so for most developers and generally more senior people.

and often I don&#39;t want to say &quot;well, I spent three days convincing VP A not to rage fire director B&quot;.

anyway I personally hate the &quot;justify your existence in public to people who don&#39;t know the context&quot;  type stuff with a passion.

No, they don&#39;t need to micromanage, just manage. If your manager doesn&#39;t know what you do, what are they managing? They should be in contact with the people they manage and communicating with them about their tasks. There are more options than &quot;stand at desk and watch employee all the time&quot; and &quot;let the employees do whatever they want&quot;.

For IT staff, any reasonably organised place will have JIRA or some other project tracking software in place, which will show you exactly who did what and when. Amazon will certainly have something like this. For general office staff there may not be something like this but still a manager who has any degree of competence should be able to say who was assigned what and whether that got done or not (and how well).

This looks like it&#39;s copying what DOGE was doing with federal employees last year. I suspect it&#39;

... from a stellar career [perchance.org] at Amazon.

Isn&#39;t this common across corporate jobs?  It&#39;s been a part of my review processes at different companies for 30ish years.

Find out who&#39;s in charge of ordering laundry detergent for Whole Foods because the stores are constantly out.  You can&#39;t even order it on Amazon itself because it&#39;s constantly out.

Once you find them, they can be fired because clearly they aren&#39;t doing their job.

For those wondering, their particular detergent has a specific ingredient which does a great job getting clothes clean.

Surely this is easy? Equally, surely your boss knows? Maybe they want to compare those two lists?

I mean I have been asked to list a few key accomplishments every year of my adult life in every job I&#39;ve had (except for the brief period where I was contracting and self-employed).

Why is this news? Or is the news here that Amazon was not doing performance reviews beforehand?

Exactly this.  I&#39;m like, so Amazon is going to do exactly what every other company does?  Okay, I guess, but why is this on slashdot?

&quot;Consider situations where you took risks or innovated, even if it didn&#39;t lead to the results you hoped for.&quot;

So if I did something other than I was told because it seemed like a bright idea to me, and it failed which resulted in a big mess, I should put that in my report as a plus?

Standard interview rules apply, which is that your &quot;failures&quot; should be, at worst, things that turned out really well but not 100% as well as you hoped.

who thinks it&#39;s a good idea of wasting energy on something that is completely irrelevant. If the action is relevant then it should have been addressed when it happened  to ensure what ever positive benefit the action had it would be repeated next time.

This is &quot;busy work&quot;. Work that is created so you look like you are busy doing something.

Let&#39;s see, is that submit to your managers, or to corporate? If the latter, what, they&#39;ll use AI to decide to keep you?

And in either case, lessee, the last five or more years before I retired, we had &quot;make a plan for improving/development.&quot; I was a sr. sysadmin, end of career, and &quot;development&quot;?

Oh no!  Now I will never get a chance to use something that never was of any value.

Microsoft&#39;s changes to their office suite constantly annoys the fuck out of me.

But, I&#39;m going to be a bit selfish and say that I really don&#39;t care about the three people that this particular change impacts.

Just ask ChatGPT how to work around this. Certainly it can microslop a solution.

The videos of Renee Nicole Good’s killing are the stuff of nightmares. On Wednesday, according to footage shot by bystanders, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross appears to shoot Good in the face at point-blank range while she attempts to drive away from another ICE agent prying at her car door. Her wife was reportedly in the seat beside her. “We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” Good’s wife sobs in one of the most upsetting videos from the encounter. “We have a 6-year-old at school.”

The normal reaction to this incident is horror, rage, and sorrow. A woman is dead, killed by the government under unimaginably traumatic circumstances, her wife mere inches away. She leaves behind three children. Photos from the scene of her death show kids’ toys spilling out of her glove compartment.

The response from Republican officials seemed to describe a different event altogether. This wasn’t a poet, wife, and mother whose life was cut short by a bullet, but, according to  Donald Trump, a “professional agitator” who “violently, willfully, and viciously” ran over her killer. (She didn’t.) In lockstep, GOP leaders lied about Good’s death and to absolve Ross of culpability, then demonized his victim. In their tale, Good was a domestic terrorist who was responsible for her own death. When GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts was asked for his reaction to the shooting on Newsmax, he said, “it’s terrible.” Not Good’s death, mind you, but “these attacks on law enforcement.”

Among their base, today’s GOP is trying to drum out any natural impulses toward compassion, such that there is no imperative to feel—let alone express—any dismay at the killing of an ideological adversary. If Good wasn’t on Trump’s side, the party line goes, she got what was coming to her. The rush to defend Ross is more than a political move to justify Trump’s personal militia run amok. It’s another round in the right wing’s mounting war on empathy.

For the past few years, influential Christian conservatives have been loudly proclaiming that empathy is toxic, a sin, and a tool of the devil. In their view, progressives use the human inclination to care for others as a way to sway evangelicals toward liberal causes, such as tackling racism or saving USAID, the dissolution of which some analysts say has already caused the deaths of 500,000 children worldwide. The innate desire among well-adjusted people to wish their neighbors happy, healthy lives is a political liability for the party of Medicaid cuts, SNAP freezes, ICE raids, refugee bans, and forced childbirth. Elon Musk has called empathy “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization.”

J.D. Vance has endorsed this perspective, too. In a Fox News interview last year, he laid out a warped version of a medieval Catholic doctrine, ordo amoris, to defend the administration’s brutal crackdown on immigrants. “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” Vance said. “And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Pope Francis later published a letter condemning the deportations that seemed to directly reject Vance’s view: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”)

In this worldview, anyone who poses a danger to those within the inner circles of human worthiness does not warrant much empathy. And it’s easy enough to argue that just about anyone is a threat to one’s family, town, or country, thus exempting them from our responsibilities of care. A drag queen, let’s say. A liberal judge. Someone wearing a Zohran Mamdani T-shirt at the grocery store. A concerned Minnesotan who stopped to film the agents plucking people out of her community.

Once a person is no longer worthy of empathy, they become a justifiable casualty in service to any political aim. There is no need to consider proportionality; killing someone for distracting ICE agents is just as defensible as ending a life on a battlefield. From the right’s perspective, Good’s political views made her fair game, so her gruesome, untimely death by the gun of a masked federal agent need not be met with outrage or remorse. Any empathy for her or her family imperils a greater project: cleansing Minneapolis of immigrants.

It’s a short distance from believing someone’s death is unworthy of mourning to believing they deserved to die, and a short distance from there to inciting more death. The Trump administration’s knee-jerk defense of the ICE agent who killed Good bears echoes of Kyle Rittenhouse, the right-wing wannabe vigilante who, at 17, traveled across state lines to fight Black Lives Matter protesters and ended up killing two of them. In the six years since then, Rittenhouse has become a GOP hero—and, wouldn’t you know, he chimed in just a few hours after Good died. “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?” he posted on X with a laughing emoji.

The instinct to recoil at the killing of a fellow person, and to feel some vicarious pain as we consider the loss, is part of what makes us human. Historically, we have pathologized people who lack such impulses; they are known as psychopaths, and their qualities have been deemed incompatible with a functioning society. Empathy is the bedrock of what it means to have a society. To live together under some form of shared governance, we have to start from a place of believing our neighbors should not be shot dead in their cars, and being upset when they are.

Over the past two days, as Republican officials have applauded Ross for killing Good, they have repeatedly lied about the videos of the shooting, insulting the intelligence of observers who know what it looks like to be run over by a car. The lies have been instantaneous, effortless, and shameless: Just look at this photo of Trump aide Natalie Harp in the Oval Office, smugly playing a video for assembled New York Times reporters, as if she could convince them they were seeing something they were not.

Every falsehood spun by Trump and his acolytes is an attempt to degrade their followers’ capacity for empathy past the point of flinching at an innocent woman’s death. The goal is to diminish the ghastliness of Good’s death, and with it, the value of her life.

A decade ago, when we imagined the horrors of living in a world fractured into different realities, we pictured something technologically dystopian. Experts warned that the time would come when we, as a public, would no longer be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. We would be fed snippets meant to inflame our anger and disgust. There would be candidate sex tapes and footage of crimes committed by racial minorities and leaked audio files with politicians saying horrible things—all fabrications. We would live in a swirl of anguished mass confusion.

But now that that technology is here, it’s finally time to admit it wasn’t ever necessary. At least not to destroy our own shared reality. For that, we just need partisan loyalties.

On Wednesday, when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, the casual and disproportionate violence seemed indisputable: no angle showed Renee Good, the driver, gunning for the ICE agent. The most charitable defense of the agent was that he was jumpy and reacted out of fear when the car started moving near his foot; it was harder to defend him shooting at the window after Good had already cleared him. But immediately, people with partisan and commercial interests in defending ICE declared that the video showed Good was trying to kill the ICE agent. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “domestic terrorism.” Official government statements cited a “ramming” event. President Trump wrote on social media that the car’s driver “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.” If you watch the videos, the ICE agent not only appears to have escaped unscathed, he also calmly holsters his gun and walks toward the car after the shooting.

And if social media is any indication—and it must be, as it remains one of the key places where large parts of the population take their cues on how to digest political news—the right has agreed to this interpretation. It needed no fake evidence; it only needed an assertion from authorities in the movement that there was a way to process what they were seeing without challenging their narratives. A simple answer that showed how, if you just thought about things the right way, you could ignore your lying eyes.

Yes, when the videos first emerged, there was some small amount of accompanying A.I.-driven disinformation. Some internet users shared A.I.-produced efforts to “unmask” the ICE agent who killed her, and others shared A.I.-generated photos of Good in conversation with the ICE agent. (Ultimately, A.I.’s biggest influence on this story was for provocation: An anonymous internet user asked an A.I. chatbot to reimagine her corpse in a bikini.)

But for the most part, the discussions surrounding the incident started from the authentic bystander videos, all of which clearly showed Good being shot as she was driving away from the officers. Trump and his allies didn’t need fraudulent evidence; they only needed to lie to themselves about what the video showed. The real video was enough for that.

As a result of all this, instead of mourning a tragedy, we’re stuck in a debate between two entirely different translations of the same material. This matters not just because it warps truth and dishonors Good’s memory but because it makes improving the world impossible. The first step to coming together to address a problem—a failure in training or protocol; a too-casual use of deadly force; a culture of hostility toward the public; or the charged situation itself, the result of a city under siege—is agreeing there is a problem. Right now, the mechanism for agreeing on that starting point is broken.

And when everything is subjective, nobody ever has to be accountable. That’s particularly true in the killing of Renee Good. But it’s also true with another event that unfolded this week: the ongoing rewriting of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the state-funded efforts to recast it as a patriotic response to a stolen election. The insurrectionists have received pardons and are asking for reparations; they no longer have to worry about accountability.

It has become clear that the insistence on polarized realities poses deeply existential threats. Threats to democracy, as with the notion that you can simply declare your election won. Threats to public safety, as with the refusal to acknowledge millions dead from a global pandemic. Threats to the planet, as with the refusal to recognize climate science. On a more intimate scale, it’s also just exhausting. It’s exhausting to be told you didn’t see what you saw; that you are lying; that you are acting on corrupt motivation, rather than pain in witnessing a human life snuffed out so casually. It’s exhausting to try to extend compassion and to be told that doing so is an inherently partisan activity.

The left is not immune to this. Liberals watched as a flailing President Biden crowed that we “finally beat Medicare” in a debate, and many still insisted he was fit for office. There had been appearances that showed his mental deterioration before that, and there would be others afterward. And yet they shook off what they could plainly see.

Still, Trump is in power, he has torn down all political norms, and his party bears far more responsibility for where we are today. But as long as everyone is willing to do this, to ignore what is right in front of us in order to arm ourselves for conversations to be won or lost, the dynamics will never change: Nothing is ever real, or not real. It’s always gray, always partisan.

Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly make all of this worse. But we won’t have to wait for that dark moment when it subsumes our reality; we’re already all too willing to alter reality in our own minds.

Last month, the Supreme Court held arguments in Olivier v. City of Brandon, a little-discussed case out of the controversial 5th Circuit that sounded, at first, like it would boil down to familiar ideological flashpoints. An evangelical preacher challenged a city ordinance under the First and 14th amendments that confined protesters to a designated zone outside a public amphitheater in Brandon, Mississippi. After the city’s police chief restricted where and how he could speak outside the theater, the preacher was cited, paid a fine, and later sued to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him again.

But inside the courtroom, the argument barely touched speech or religion. Instead, the justices together gravitated toward something else entirely: a problem about time, causation, and whether constitutional authority can be temporally partitioned. Does the Constitution operate only forward? Can a law be unconstitutional tomorrow yet legally untouchable yesterday? And can a single conviction permanently close the courthouse doors to the people most harmed by an unconstitutional rule?

Those questions animated nearly every exchange. The court was wrestling not with what the First Amendment protects, but with whether constitutional rights can be exhausted by a single successful act of punishment.

The case turns on Heck v. Humphrey, a 1994 decision holding that civil rights lawsuits cannot be used to undermine the validity of a still-standing criminal conviction. The idea is straightforward. If you want to challenge the legality of your conviction or confinement, you must proceed through habeas, not through a damages suit.

But Olivier is not asking to undo his past conviction. He is asking the court to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him in the future. The 5th Circuit nevertheless held that even this forward-looking challenge is barred under Heck because success would “necessarily imply” that his earlier conviction was invalid.

That logic produces something like constitutional amnesia. A potentially unconstitutional law can be challenged by people who have never been punished under it, but not by the person who has already borne its force. The state’s prior enforcement becomes a kind of legal eraser, wiping away the injured party’s ability to seek future protection.

What makes this move especially strained is that Heck was never meant to function as a roving doctrine of constitutional quarantine. It was designed to prevent civil lawsuits from becoming backdoor appeals of criminal judgments. It polices remedies and the finality of convictions, not the enforceability of unconstitutional laws going forward. When the doctrine is stretched to block purely prospective relief, it stops mediating between two remedial systems and starts manufacturing a new form of immunity, one that insulates unconstitutional rules simply because they have already succeeded once. In that transformation, Heck ceases to be a rule about procedural sequencing and becomes a rule about who is permitted to invoke constitutional protection at all.

The court seemed acutely aware of the tension. Several justices pressed the same concern from different angles. If Olivier wins and the ordinance is declared unconstitutional, does that not logically demonstrate that his past conviction was unlawful too? Justice Elena Kagan put the problem plainly. If a court declares the statute unconstitutional, “what follows from that logically is that the past conviction was infirm.”

The discomfort was palpable. No one wanted to say out loud that constitutional protection must bend to the preservation of old judgments. Yet that is exactly what the 5th Circuit’s rule requires.

As the hypotheticals posed by the justices multiplied, the doctrine began to drift from lived reality. What if a defendant is still on probation when he seeks prospective relief? Would an injunction against future enforcement undermine the probation condition not to violate the law again? What if collateral consequences persist, such as reporting requirements or licensing barriers?

The answers became increasingly abstract. The law tried to slice time into clean compartments. Yesterday’s conviction remains untouched. Tomorrow’s enforcement is forbidden. Between the two sits a fragile procedural fiction the system clings to in order to pretend these worlds do not meaningfully collide.

This is where rights start to resemble procedural ghosts. They exist in theory but lose substance in practice. They hover over the future while refusing to acknowledge the bodies they already passed through. Law becomes ritualized rather than responsive, and the problem of temporality determines whether constitutional law recognizes continuity across lived experience or whether it tolerates a fragmented legal time in which the same rule can be forbidden prospectively yet insulated retrospectively.

One irony hovered over the argument. The person with the strongest proof that the ordinance threatens constitutional injury is Olivier himself. He has already been stopped, cited, and punished. Past enforcement is the clearest evidence that future enforcement is likely. Even the government conceded that a third party could bring the same challenge and that such a ruling would equally undermine the logic of Olivier’s conviction.

The result is a system in which the people most harmed by unconstitutional laws become the least able to contest them and the Constitution speaks through hypothetical plaintiffs rather than lived ones. Beneath the doctrinal sparring lies a familiar institutional fear characterized by destabilizing final judgments, opening procedural floodgates, and unraveling the architecture of criminal finality. Courts value closure, fear endless relitigation, and worry about conflicting judgments.

Those concerns are not frivolous. But they carry a cost. When administrative peace becomes the dominant value, constitutional rights risk becoming archival artifacts rather than living guarantees. The question is not whether finality matters, but whether finality should subordinate the Constitution itself.

At its core, Olivier asks whether constitutional rights belong to citizens as ongoing protections or merely as retrospective abstractions that harden once violated. Can the Constitution operate only in the future while the past is sealed off as doctrinally untouchable? Or does constitutional meaning necessarily travel across time, illuminating both what was done and what may not be done again?

If constitutional protections can expire the moment the state successfully enforces a law once, then what exactly are they protecting?

The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in office has seen him unleash heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Democratic-leaning cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis in what clearly appears to be a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at punishing those cities for their citizens’ political views. These officers’ behavior has been violent enough that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently established a commission to look into charging federal agents in state court for their actions. So far, however, despite a growing list of violent and threatening acts by ICE and CBP, no local prosecutor in any city that ICE and CBP has “blitzed” has filed charges against any federal officers.

That may now change. On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old widowed mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old child, whose car was blocking theirs. While the Department of Homeland Security quickly claimed the officer was acting in self-defense—DHS Secretary Kristi Noem hyperbolically said the officer was defending himself against “domestic terrorism”—cellphone videos taken by people on the scene tell a much different story. The officers aggressively approached the car, and none of the officers involved appear to be in much risk of harm before one opens fire at almost point-blank range, firing multiple shots through the window of the car, striking Good in the head and killing her. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already said the state will “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.” And the Minneapolis police chief has likewise called for an investigation in a statement that put Good’s life, not the officer’s safety, in the foreground. All this certainly seems to suggest there is a real chance that local officials are open to arresting the still-unnamed ICE officer and charging him with homicide.

Which, to be clear, they legally can do. Back in October, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of state for policy who is the driving force behind the current militaristic deployment of ICE and CBP, publicly told ICE officers during a Fox News interview that local officials could not even stop them, much less arrest them. But he is wrong. While it is true that federal courts have read the U.S. Constitution’s “supremacy clause” to give federal law enforcement a lot of protection from local charges, that protection can disappear if those officers act too recklessly, as is certainly plausible here.

It is also important to note that the claim made on Thursday by Noem that the FBI is excluding Minnesota authorities from the investigation because only the FBI has jurisdiction is completely incorrect as well. The FBI’s own website acknowledges that it cannot “take over” investigations from local authorities.

So the question now becomes not whether local officials can prosecute the ICE agent, but whether an investigation yields proof a crime was committed and they have the political desire to follow through with charges. At the investigatory level, it is not promising that the Minnesota’s state-level Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that it was no longer investigating the shooting due to the FBI’s refusal to cooperate, a choice that is not legally required by the FBI’s obstructive actions. But the Minneapolis Police Department, which is ultimately under the control of a clearly angry Mayor Jacob Frey, is still free to conduct its own investigation.

Perhaps more important, there is certainly evidence to suggest that the Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty—who can bring charges even without any arrest—is not one to back down from a case like this. The former chief public defender for Hennepin County (the home of Minneapolis), she ran as a reform candidate for the top prosecutor job in 2022; one of her platform’s positions was the need to better hold police accountable for misconduct, including charging them when they break the law.

Since taking office, she has sought to do so, if perhaps sometimes arguably too aggressively. In 2024, she found herself caught up in a controversy over charging a state trooper, Ryan Londregan, with homicide when he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop. Londregan shot and killed Cobb when, he claimed, Cobb was reaching for his gun during a struggle during the stop. While Moriarty pushed for charges, she eventually had to hire outside counsel to pursue the case because allegedly no prosecutors in her own office were willing to. At one point the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was keeping tabs on the case in case he needed to step in to deal with it himself, likely out of concern that Moriarty was being overly aggressive. Tellingly, the state police union, the MPPOA, asked for Ellison—the man whose office convicted Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd—to intervene, although Moriarty eventually dropped the charges on her own.

In other words, Moriarty does not appear to be one who would back down from a fight here. And it is a fight that will likely be politically popular. ICE is deeply unpopular nationwide. The only federal agency that is liked less is the IRS. And despite a massive media and sign-on incentive campaign fueled by billions of unrestricted dollars that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” gave ICE, the agency has struggled to find people willing to join it. Moreover, Moriarty represents the people of Hennepin County, where Kamala Harris defeated Trump in 2024 by over 40 points, and ICE is absolutely detested by Democrats and independents. In a November 2025 YouGov poll, 85 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents said they “somewhat or strongly disapprove” of ICE. And while GOP support for ICE remains quite high, we saw in Chicago that even Republicans seem to tire of ICE when it arrives in their communities.

One important caveat: The political upside is not directly relevant for Moriarty, since she announced this summer that she is not running for reelection. But she said that she was declining to run because she wanted the rest of her term to be about putting criminal legal reform in a good light and felt controversies around her distracted from that, so the politics of charging an ICE officer likely still matter to her. And the outrage already clearly brewing in Minneapolis makes it clear that the people of Hennepin are demanding accountability.

It’s also worth asking why we haven’t seen any similar efforts to prosecute federal officers in other strongly Democratic-leaning counties that have seen aggressive, violent ICE and CBP enforcement. Part of it is likely just the nature of the cases: The other lethal shootings have seemed more ambiguous, and the returns on going after nonhomicide assaults—even egregious ones like sniping a reverend in the head with a pepper ball—may not justify the unavoidable challenges of trying to convict federal officials on state charges.

But part of it may also be that we are seeing some of the costs of the Democrats’ only-lukewarm embrace of criminal legal reform. In 2024, a tough-on-crime Democrat, who received the endorsement of the local police union, squeaked out a razor-thin win over a more reform-minded candidate in the primary for Cook County state’s attorney, leaving Chicago with a prosecutor disinclined to go after the police in general as “Operation Midway Blitz” kicked off. And in Los Angeles, reformer George Gascón lost his reelection campaign in 2024 to a former federal prosecutor who has often remained distinctly quiet in the face of aggressive ICE behavior. By electing prosecutors less willing to confront police misconduct, two cities hit hard by ICE also found themselves with prosecutors less willing to stand up against ICE for them. (At least in California, however, the state attorney general still has the freedom to step in to pick up any perceived slack; the Illinois attorney general has less power in this regard.)

But whatever hesitancy we have seen elsewhere, it’s certainly possible that Minneapolis will be the first city to push back against the current right-wing authoritarianism in D.C. by indicting one of its federal agents for murder. The video evidence is shocking, the public outrage in Minneapolis and beyond is growing, and the city happens to be home to a prosecutor who has spent her legal career fighting police violence.

            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 From disposable electric candy to voice-activated refrigerators without physical handles, CES was crammed full of enshittified, intrusive, insecure, and wasteful technology this year – just like it is every year.

As regularly as bad tech shows up in Las Vegas in January, Repair.org and its allies in the repairability and tech responsibility movement were there to award a list of the worst things on display this year.

As was the case in 2025, there&#39;s a lot of AI on this list – but not just AI. There&#39;s some literal garbage on it, too.

Public Interest Research Group&#39;s right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor had an obvious choice to make when it came to the worst environmental impact: Lollipop Star.

Literally a piece of e-waste in waiting, Lollipop Stars are suckers with an integrated battery and tiny speaker that, when placed in one&#39;s mouth, transmit sound through jaw vibrations, delivering what the brand calls &quot;music you can taste.&quot;

The device is non-rechargeable, gets about 60 minutes of battery life, plays a single song, and once the sucker is gone, it&#39;s garbage.

&quot;We need to stop making so many disposable electronics which are full of toxic chemicals, require critical minerals to produce, and can burn down waste facilities,&quot; Proctor said, noting that there are thousands of garbage fires every year due to improper disposal of batteries.

A Chinese company called Merach was in Las Vegas this week showing off its smart treadmill that comes with a conversational AI coach. In and of itself, that&#39;s nothing special – there&#39;s plenty of smart home fitness equipment with embedded AI available.

As Secure Resilient Future Foundation president and Securepairs founder Paul Roberts pointed out, it&#39;s not the tech that earned the worst in show cybersecurity award this year – it&#39;s the company&#39;s outright statement that your data just isn&#39;t safe.

&quot;In addition to personal information, network and online behavior, financial information … Merach&#39;s treadmills are also collecting biometric data, fitness and performance data, and the inferences that can be drawn from that information,&quot; Roberts explained in a video highlighting the ignominious awardees.

&quot;That&#39;s not surprising, but what is surprising was the security statement,&quot; Roberts continued, pointing to the Merach&#39;s privacy policy, which includes the rather bold admission that &quot;we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.&quot;

That alone, said Roberts, was enough to earn a place in the list.

Ever want to put a surveillance device on your desk that you can pretend is your girlfriend? No?

Well, neither did those who weighed in on the people&#39;s choice award for CES 2026 worst in show, which was awarded to the Lepro Ami AI &quot;Soulmate.&quot;

Take that creepy Stan Lee hologram, shrink it down to fit on your desk, and turn it into an anime waifu and you have the Lepro Ami AI. As CES visitors pointed out, it has an always-on camera and microphone, and while one can physically shutter the camera, users weren&#39;t impressed with the mental health-damaging privacy intrusion that is this unnecessary device.

Tech critic Cory Doctorow, who coined the term &quot;enshittification&quot; to describe how once-useful tech gradually becomes worse for users in a bid to extract maximum profit, was the natural choice to present the 2026 enshittification award. He handed it out to German tech firm Bosch for its eBike antitheft system that&#39;s basically just a parts-pairing nightmare waiting to happen.

Per Bosch, the new system allows users to report their eBikes as stolen through a mobile app, which is configured with serial numbers of the components on the bike. This naturally requires all the eBike&#39;s components to be registered to a specific user.

The catch? Bosch has total control over how parts are registered and reused.

&quot;Bosch can flip a switch and then you wouldn&#39;t be able to do independent repair using parts unless Bosch says they like the part that you were using,&quot; Doctorow said. &quot;Every manufacturer that started with parts pairing said they were fighting theft and counterfeiting and ended up using it to block independent repair.&quot;

We reported on the downright dystopian wildfire detection feature Amazon Ring unveiled at CES this week, but that wasn&#39;t why Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn chose Ring AI as the worst in show for privacy this year.

Citing the &quot;sheer expansion of surveillance capabilities that [Amazon] is supporting this year,&quot; Cohn expressed concern with facial recognition in Ring cameras, commercially deployable surveillance towers, and a new app store she said is &quot;going to let people develop even sketchier apps for the doorbell than ones that Amazon already provides.&quot;

More surveillance, Cohn added, doesn&#39;t always make us safer.

Bosch gets a second mention on the list of the CES 2026 worst in show with its 800 Series Personal AI Barista, a coffee maker that integrates Alexa+ to brew drinks on demand and is touted as the first espresso machine in the world to be powered by Amazon&#39;s new natural language AI tech.

The machine earned the &quot;who asked for this&quot; award, as – quite honestly – this sounds like more work than it&#39;s worth.

&quot;Adding voice control to a fancy coffee maker so you can tell it to make you a macchiato without having to learn the details&quot; is a good idea &quot;in theory,&quot; Consumer Reports director of technology policy Justin Brookman said. &quot;But in reality many people don&#39;t actually want to have a conversation with their coffee maker. It&#39;s too early for that – they just want to hit a couple buttons and get a nice cup of coffee.&quot;

In addition, as an Alexa+ device, it requires a Prime subscription, so even if you do love Alexa being your personal barista, cancelling your Prime account to save $139 a year would turn it into a simple dumb coffeemaker. And heaven forbid if Bosch decides to stop supporting it in a few years - not that such a thing has ever happened before.

For the second year running, a smart refrigerator has earned top honors for bringing garbage tech into consumers&#39; homes, though this time Samsung is stealing the crown from LG.

In this case, Samsung&#39;s Family Hub Smart Fridge earns double honors for being the worst in show for repairability and the overall worst in show, largely for the same reasons.

As iFixit chief Kyle Wiens explained, the new Samsung Smart Fridge doesn&#39;t actually have any physical handles, and is opened and closed entirely by voice command, quite possibly one of the stupidest things this vulture has ever heard of.

Noisy kitchen? Good luck opening the fridge. Mechanism breaks? Good luck opening the fridge. Internet outage? You know the drill.

As Wiens noted, Samsung has a poor track record when it comes to the quality of its fridges, with touchscreens (of course there&#39;s one on this one, too), compressors, and other components regularly failing.

Digital Right to Repair Coalition executive director Gay Gordon-Byrne said that the Samsung fridge was the worst thing she&#39;d seen at CES this year thanks to its excessive points of failure, connectivity dependence, and the fact that Samsung is serving ads on users&#39; refrigerators.

&quot;The one thing a refrigerator should do is keep things cold,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. &quot;It needs to do that all the time; it needs to do that without difficulty.&quot;

Gordon-Byrne noted that Samsung&#39;s refrigerator is anything but that, with any number of situations leading to inaccessible food.

&quot;These things should not interfere with your use of a very simple device,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is writing more checks for nuclear investment, even though the new capacity tied to those deals is unlikely to come online until around 2030. The company says it will need the new power to run its hyperscale datacenters.

Facebook&#39;s parent company says it has inked agreements with three outfits - TerraPower and Oklo are developing new reactor technology or building fresh sites, while Vistra is supporting existing nuclear plants. All three will deliver electricity into the grid rather than straight to Meta&#39;s own facilities.

Meta claims that this work is part of ongoing efforts with electric utility companies and power providers to &quot;plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational.&quot;

Just over a year ago, the social media giant estimated that it would need one to four gigawatts of nuclear power in the future, on top of the energy it already consumes, and put out a request for proposals (RFP) to find firms willing to supply it.

That was followed by today&#39;s agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. Meta claims that these, along with the one signed last June with Constellation Energy, make it one of the largest corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in America, as the three combined will eventually add up to 6.6 GW to the grid.

However, missing from all of this is any mention of cost. We asked Meta how much these agreements are worth, but a spokesperson told us that it does not share the financial details of its clean energy agreements.

The deal with Oklo is for an &quot;advanced nuclear technology campus&quot; in Pike County, Ohio. This is expected to deliver up to 1.2 GW of baseload power to the PJM grid, which Meta says will support its operations in the region. This &quot;may&quot; come online as early as 2030.

Oklo, which is backed by OpenAI kingpin Sam Altman, disclosed in 2024 that it had interest from two major datacenter operators to provide power for them. Equinix signed an agreement last year.

The firm said it will use Meta&#39;s funding to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of its Aurora powerhouse deployment. This is the name bestowed on its facilities, which are designed to look more like a Scandinavian log cabin or an art gallery than a power plant.

With TerraPower, the agreement is to support early development for two of the firm&#39;s Natrium reactors and energy storage system plants capable of generating up to 690 MW, plus rights for energy from up to six other units.

Each Natrium reactor is a 345 MW sodium fast reactor, which TerraPower pairs with a molten salt energy storage system designed to deliver gigawatt-scale output. Delivery of the initial units is slated for 2032.

Vistra already operates a number of nuclear power plants, and Meta&#39;s deal with it comprises 20-year power purchase agreements from three of these.

According to Vistra, Meta is paying for about 2.1 GW from the already operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio, plus 433 MW of incremental capacity from power uprates at those sites and the Beaver Valley facility in Pennsylvania.

This additional capacity is expected to come online in the early 2030s, supporting the &quot;growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future,&quot; Meta said. In other words, the electricity generated at the plants will continue to flow to the grid.

In the meantime, Meta&#39;s mega server farms will continue to be largely powered by electricity generated using fossil fuels. Even the $10 billion facility it is building in Louisiana will be powered by gas turbines, even though this is not expected to come online until 2030, around the time its atomic investments are set to bear fruit.

As The Register reported last year, nuclear power may be seen as the ideal solution to power the AI-driven datacenter expansion, but build times for atomic plants mean that any additional capacity won&#39;t be ready until the next decade – leaving a gap that needs plugging somehow. ®

            <h2>Debian goes retro with a spatial desktop that time forgot</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/desktop_classic_system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Desktop Classic System is a rather unusual hand-built flavor of Debian featuring a meticulously configured spatial desktop layout and a pleasingly 20th-century look and feel.

DCS, as project creator &quot;Mycophobia&quot; calls it, has been around in one form or another since 2023, but it came to the attention of The Reg FOSS desk thanks to mentions on the Lobste.rs community and a few days later on OSnews.

It&#39;s a minimalist, opinionated setup of Debian 13 &quot;Trixie&quot; with the MATE desktop, specially configured for spatial operation. That itself is a rare thing in the 21st century, but it&#39;s not the only unusual thing about this distro. There&#39;s no ISO image available, just a ZIP file containing the files needed to put on a blank FAT32 USB key to make it bootable.

Incidentally, merely copying some files onto a FAT32 volume isn&#39;t enough to make it bootable using a traditional BIOS – so this is a distro only for installation on real hardware that has UEFI firmware. As a side effect, it will be significantly tricky to try it out in a VM.

We tried it on both new and old Reg FOSS desk testbeds: a modern Dell XPS 13, with a USB-C external display, and a retro ThinkPad W520 with an Nvidia switchable second GPU, which needs version 390 or earlier of the Nvidia binary driver, so it&#39;s unsupported on anything newer than kernel 6.4 or so. It ran fine on both; although it was very slow to start on the ThinkPad, once booted it became snappy and responsive.

The Desktop Classic System in dual-head mode with a portrait monitor – enough to confuse some distros

The distro is a very stripped-back copy of Debian 13 &quot;Trixie&quot; with a customized MATE setup – the stock MATE 1.26 that Debian 13 provides. The distro is very bare. There are no additional apps, not even Firefox. There&#39;s only a mostly empty top panel, without the usual window buttons. It takes about 6 GB of disk and idles at under 800 MB of RAM in use. It&#39;s not a cut-down lightweight distro, it&#39;s just Debian with no extras at all.

The desktop is very sparse and clean, with a layout somewhat in the style of Classic Mac OS – in other words, the original Apple OS for the Mac from 1984 to 2001. No 21st century OS (except possibly Haiku) offers a true spatial metaphor, and as a result, the phrase &quot;spatial desktop&quot; gets misunderstood and misused, as we noted a few years back concerning Zorin OS 17. The Zorin folks interpreted &quot;spatial&quot; to refer to 3D effects for switching between apps and virtual desktops – but that is not the original meaning at all.

The core idea is a desktop that lets you use your spatial memory to navigate. The desktop remembers where you place icons, where windows were and their size and view settings, and when you click on a directory later, its window will reopen the same size in the same place. Mycophobia has described her preference for a spatial desktop and her choice of components at some length. She links to some truly seminal resources on the subject, notably the seriously deep and analytical essays of John Siracusa, the former Mac OS guru at Ars Technica, who wrote a lot about the spatial Finder in the early days of Mac OS X. (We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention the SpatialFinder tool, which attempts to re-enable this behavior on modern macOS.) Mycophobia also links to a piece on The Decline of Usability by Carl Svensson, which eloquently critiques modern UI design.

DCS with lots of Caja (née Nautilus file manager) windows open

This sort of desktop behavior polarizes people. Some people strongly prefer things to stay where they&#39;re put; others are happier with one or two automatically sorted windows. This vulture was extremely fond of Classic Mac OS, but on the other hand, we also like window tiling and self-organizing lists of files.

Either way, as well as writing long polemics about how she likes things, Mycophobia has gone the extra mile: she&#39;s put together a complete distro that you can install and use, configured how she likes it.

It&#39;s an interesting exercise, and we suspect this will appeal strongly to some people. It&#39;s the current Debian, with a very simple clean desktop layout. For instance, rather than MATE&#39;s stock three main menus, it has a single combined Windows-style one provided by the Brisk menu. We used the built-in extrepo command to add the Mozilla Debian-package repository and installed the latest Firefox:

And that was all it took: we were online, with a current browser. We added Chrome, Pandoc, and Panwriter, and were ready to get some work done.

By contemporary standards, the desktop setup is strange in several ways. Firstly, some standard MATE features have been turned off. There&#39;s no Win95-style row of window buttons. The closest thing is the MATE &quot;Window Selector&quot; applet, a discreet little icon in the notification area. That&#39;s OK with us. This vulture started using Macs when System 6 was still current, we still like Classic Mac OS today, and it has no graphical window switcher either.

Window title bars are sparse too. There&#39;s a close box at the right end, as is fairly standard these days. On the left are two buttons we see much less. The leftmost is a &quot;roll up&quot; button, which acts like a roller-blind: it collapses the window into its own title bar, leaving nothing else on screen. A few decades ago, many Mac users added this to Mac OS with an addon called WindowShades. It&#39;s a viable alternative to the minimize function that the influence of Microsoft Windows has made ubiquitous – but unless you neaten them into a staggered array, it can leave you with a cluttered collection of title bars. To the right of this is a button labeled &quot;Always On Visible Workspace.&quot; This pins the window so that it remains visible even when you switch virtual desktops. This vulture happens to prefer multiple physical screens to virtual ones, but if you hop between virtual desktops a lot then this could be handy.

And that&#39;s your lot. There are no maximize or minimize controls here. Less visibly, there&#39;s no snapping of windows to screen edges either. We liked the Aero Snap feature but we do understand that many people hated it, and Mycophobia seems to be one.

This leaves a big hole. Literally. The panel is almost empty – a Start menu on the left, a notification area on the right, and a yawning gap between them. Unlike Mac OS, there&#39;s no global menu bar. Again, like window snapping, this is a feature that some people like and others hate. We like them, so we tried to add them by installing the relevant MATE applet with apt install mate-applet-appmenu and added it to the panel. After a reboot, some apps used it, including Chrome and Panwriter, but more config is needed to get standard MATE accessories to use it. It may be that Mycophobia just doesn&#39;t like it, or that it doesn&#39;t integrate well. We noticed that it made the Brisk menu flicker sometimes, and although we enabled Firefox&#39;s global menu support, some menu options were inaccessible – the menus closed before we could reach some entries.

The fact that Chrome, which normally has a hamburger menu and no menu bar at all, picks up and automatically uses this feature when it&#39;s enabled shows that this can work. We wish distro makers put a bit more effort into polishing the rough edges of this existing functionality, and make it an option that can just be turned on and off, as it was in Unity. KDE Plasma really needs this option since too many of its apps are riddled with hamburger menus. We feel that the Desktop Classic System needs this option too. An ISO file and legacy-BIOS support would also be good to have.

These things aside, though, we rather like what we see here, and think it might appeal to quite a few people looking to escape the chaotic mess that is desktop UI design in the 2020s. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/alleged_russian_ransom_payment_negotiator/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">France has released an alleged ransomware crook wanted by the US in exchange for a conflict researcher imprisoned in Russia.

The prisoner swap occurred Thursday, with president Vladimir Putin pardoning French researcher and political scientist Laurent Vinatier.

Vinatier, 49, was sentenced to three years in a Russian prison in October 2024 for failing to register as a foreign agent. The FSB claimed he collected &quot;military and military-technical information&quot; during his time in Russia.

The researcher, a consultant for the Swiss NGO Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, reportedly faced more serious espionage charges in August after being found guilty under foreign agent law.

Specializing in the Ukraine war, Vinatier&#39;s work focused on communicating between states mired in conflict, outside of official channels.

Vinatier&#39;s release was negotiated by France, which was holding basketball player Daniil Kasatkin in custody since June 2025 at the request of US officials seeking his extradition.

Kasatkin, 26, was accused of aiding ransomware negotiations between a major, unnamed cybercrime outfit and around 900 victims, including two US federal departments.

Kasatkin denied all allegations. His lawyer, Frédéric Belot, said at the time of his arrest: &quot;He bought a used computer. He did absolutely nothing wrong. He&#39;s shocked.

&quot;He&#39;s useless with computers. He can&#39;t even install an app. He didn&#39;t touch anything on this computer. It was either hacked, or sold to him by a hacker who wanted to pass himself off as someone else.&quot;

The basketball player, who previously played for professional team MBA-MAI Moscow - and Penn State University before that - allegedly assisted the attacks between 2020-2022.

French President Emmanuel Macron, said via X: &quot;Our compatriot Laurent Vinatier is free and back in France. I share the relief of his family and loved ones. My gratitude to our diplomatic agents for their mobilization.&quot;

For years under Putin&#39;s rule, Russia has engaged in so-called prisoner diplomacy whereby the state imprisons Western figures who can be exchanged for the return of Russian agents.

On August 1, 2024, the largest exchange of prisoners since the Cold War took place between Russia and the West. Described as a highly complex negotiation, the result was an unequal deal favoring the West. Twenty-four individuals were freed in total: 16 for the West, and eight Russians, including several cybercriminals and state assassin Vadim Krasikov. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">North Korean government hackers are turning QR codes into credential-stealing weapons, the FBI has warned, as Pyongyang&#39;s spies find new ways to duck enterprise security and help themselves to cloud logins.

In an advisory published this week, the agency said the Nork-linked &quot;Kimsuky&quot; group has been embedding malicious URLs inside QR codes delivered in carefully-crafted spear phishing emails, a technique the industry is now calling &quot;quishing.&quot;

When a target scans the booby-trapped code, usually on a phone that security teams have little visibility into, they are redirected to attacker-run pages posing as Microsoft 365, Okta, or VPN portals, where credentials and session tokens are quietly stolen and later reused to bypass multi-factor authentication.

The FBI said these campaigns, seen throughout 2025, have targeted thinktanks, academic institutions, and US and foreign government organizations connected to North Korea policy, foreign affairs, and national security.

The emails themselves don&#39;t look especially sinister – a phony event invite here, a request for comment on a policy paper there – but scan the QR code and you&#39;re dumped into an attacker-controlled portal. From there, stolen logins are used to stay within the network and, in some cases, fire off more phishing emails from the victim&#39;s own account.

Quishing is especially dangerous because it can bypass the security tools that defenders rely on. Tools like URL rewriting, sandbox analysis, and email filtering can&#39;t inspect a graphic QR code, and once the victim has scanned it on an unmanaged device, security teams may not notice until it is too late.

The Feds are urging organizations to stop letting employees scan mystery QR codes and stop pretending phones don&#39;t count as endpoints by adding controls that can inspect QR links before users scan them.

The emergence of QR-based credential theft fits into a broader pattern of cyber operations by Pyongyang&#39;s cyber operators. Last year, researchers identified another longstanding DPRK-linked crew, known as KONNI, abusing Google&#39;s &quot;Find My Device&quot; functionality to remotely factory-reset compromised Android phones, erasing evidence of espionage and locking users out of their devices.

KONNI, which has also been observed deploying custom backdoors disguised as North Korea policy papers or government forms, has overlapping infrastructure with other DPRK outfits, including Kimsuky, according to security firm Genians.

As ever, the weakest link isn&#39;t some zero-day exploit, but the everyday stuff people trust without thinking. Turns out a square barcode is more than enough. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is celebrating the resurgence of interest in physical media in the only way it knows how… by halting the Windows Media Player metadata service.

Readers of a certain vintage will remember inserting a CD into their PC and watching Windows Media Player populate with track listings and album artwork. No more. Sometime before Christmas, the metadata servers stopped working and on Windows 10 or 11, the result is the same: album not found.

We tried this out at Vulture Central on some sacrificial Windows devices that had media drives and can confirm that a variety of compact discs were met with stony indifference. Some 90s cheese that was successfully ripped (for personal use, of course) decades ago? No longer recognized. A reissue of something achingly hip? Also not recognized.

Windows Media Player - guess the album - Click to enlarge

We asked Microsoft if the service had indeed been retired or if there might be a reprieve or workaround, but we were met with equal indifference from the tech giant&#39;s PR organ.

A message on a Reddit forum purporting to be a chat with a Microsoft support representative suggested that the servers have indeed been shut down, and that a third-party alternative should be sourced.

Alternatively, customers can manually enter the information, like it&#39;s the 1990s all over again.

The timing is unfortunate. Tired of content vanishing from streaming services or disappearing into algorithmic feeds, consumers are returning to physical media like CDs.

Physical media drives have yet to completely disappear from Windows devices, but the default service used by Windows Media Player for album information, musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com, does not appear to serve up any metadata.

Windows Media Player has a long history with Windows. First released as part of the Multimedia Extensions for Windows 3.0, it evolved over the years, gaining support for streaming, ripping, and burning CDs. It survived Microsoft&#39;s Zune experiment and remains in Windows 11 - though now branded &quot;Legacy&quot; as Microsoft pushes users toward its modern Media Player app.

Microsoft does not share its device telemetry, but it clearly concluded too few users still play CDs to justify maintaining the metadata services.

Apple&#39;s iTunes, on the other hand, recognized every CD we threw at it. ®

﻿The agreements will see Meta fund the construction of new nuclear reactors to power its AI data centers.

Meta has forged agreements with three nuclear power providers in an effort to secure the vast amount of electricity it needs to power AI data centers. The agreements with TerraPower (which is backed by Bill Gates), Oklo (backed by Sam Altman), and Vistra are expected to deliver 6.6 gigawatts of energy for Meta’s projects by 2035 — which is enough energy to power Ireland.

These AI projects include Prometheus, the first of several supercluster computing systems, which is expected to come online in New Albany, Ohio, sometime this year. Meta is funding the construction of new nuclear reactors as part of the agreements, the first of which may come online “as early as 2030.” These announcements are part of Meta’s ongoing goal to support its future AI operations with nuclear energy, having previously signed a deal with Constellation to revive an aging nuclear power plant last year.

Financial information for the agreements hasn’t been released, but Meta says that it will “pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses.”

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history,” Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, said in the announcement. “State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI.”

﻿Charlie Brooker says he wants season 8 to feel “more Black Mirror than ever.”

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

In an interview with Netflix’s Tudum, Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker announced today that the sci-fi anthology series will be returning for an eighth season.

“Well, luckily it does have a future, so I can confirm that Black Mirror will return, just in time for reality to catch up with it,” Brooker said. “That chunk of my brain has already been activated and is whirring away.”

Brooker didn’t go into detail about what kinds of new Black Mirror stories he plans to tell next, but he explained how thinks of each season as an album made up of different kinds of songs.

“Our very early episodes were all punk singles, and then we started doing occasional ballads like ‘San Junipero,’” Brooker said.

Brooker says he’s still figuring out what kind of tune he wants for the show’s eighth season, but he also made it clear that it’s “very unlikely you’ll ever see a Black Mirror hoedown.”

Samsung gave us our first hands-on look at the Galaxy Z TriFold, Motorola launched its first book-style Razr Fold, and phone keyboard company Clicks revealed its BlackBerry-esque Android phone the Communicator.

But there’s one upcoming phone we didn’t see: The T1 Phone 8002 (gold version), the phone “designed with American values in mind,” was nowhere to be seen at the largest tech show in the US.

I searched for Trump Mobile’s handset across the various Las Vegas convention centers and hotel suites that make up the sprawl of CES. Trump Mobile didn’t hold a press conference, nor did it reach out to The Verge to set up any meetings at Trump Tower. Searching for “Trump” in the CES exhibitor database shows no results at all — and it’s the same story for Liberty Mobile, the MVNO that Trump Mobile is piggybacking on to provide its network.

It’s not really a surprise that Trump Mobile isn’t here, of course, nor that it doesn’t want to show off its phone. The T1 Phone is now five months late for its initial August release, with no official announcement from the company about why the phone is so delayed or when it’s actually expected to release.

But for a phone company so proud of its American values — remember, there are still “American hands behind every device,” even if the T1 Phone is no longer claimed to be made in the US — you might have expected it to take part in the country’s premier tech event. CES is the largest dedicated tech convention held in the United States, with over 142,000 attendees at last year’s show, and its organizer, the Consumer Technology Association, is the trade organization that represents the US tech industry.

Trump Mobile certainly isn’t too small to exhibit at CES, with large sections of the show devoted to minor companies and startups — in smartphones alone, brands like Clicks and the privacy-focused Hiroh have shown their wares in Vegas this week, so the show isn’t limited to industry giants like Motorola and Samsung. And while even small booths at the official show can cost tens of thousands, there are cheaper ways to exhibit, including pre-show events like Showstoppers or Pepcom, and even the option to simply book a hotel suite for the night and invite journalists and other attendees to see your products there.

The question is: Did Trump Mobile decide that it wouldn’t get enough value from making an appearance at CES? Or does it simply not have a phone to show off?

As ever, Trump Mobile did not reply to my request for comment.

If you choose to get an extra controller for your Nintendo Switch 2, you can spend a lot — and get a lot in return. Buying Nintendo’s own $89 Switch 2 Pro Controller, for instance, will net you the console’s only wireless controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening, not to mention great-feeling rumble, OS-level rear button customization, and a slick design. It’s not perfect, but it’s the total package.

But it’d be a disservice to you to call it a day there. There are several third-party offerings that are cheaper, yet don’t make too many compromises in terms of features. I’ve spent time testing a handful of them, including new ones as they release, and there’s a small batch of models that I think will satisfy most people, with a range of styles, prices, and features.

Every controller I’ve included in this guide is compatible with both the Switch 2 and original Switch (all of them can remotely wake the Switch 2), as well as the PC. Each offering also includes better, longer-lasting joystick technology than you’ll get with Nintendo’s flagship controller; the Switch 2 Pro Controller’s potentiometer-based joysticks are prone to degradation over time, after all, but our picks include either Hall effect or TMR joysticks. I’ve highlighted any controller-specific perks in the blurbs below.

I put my pricey Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller away and cycle in each of these candidates for multi-session tests with a mix of games for the Switch 2. I spend time assessing their ergonomics, button location, and the quality of each button press and trigger pull. I also strive to test each controller’s unique functions.

Most people would rather spend $89.99 on two games, not a single controller. We sought cheaper alternatives to Nintendo’s fantastic Switch 2 Pro Controller, but we hate compromising on features and quality as much as anyone. We aim to include wireless gamepads that can remotely wake the Switch 2, as well as offerings that feature good-feeling rumble and a few extras, such as amiibo support.

Our top picks are just as comfortable to use as Nintendo’s flagship gamepad — perhaps more comfortable, depending on your taste. We’ve included picks with Xbox- and PlayStation-style stick layouts, as well as one that feels similar to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.

Nintendo opted for potentiometer-based joysticks with its pricey Switch 2 controller, which may result in “stick drift” later on, if its last-gen controller tech is anything to go by. Every pick in this guide builds upon that technology with either Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, which are drift-resistant by design.

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 1,200mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes

The EasySMX S10 is nearly as capable and comfortable as the Switch 2 Pro Controller, yet it’s $30 cheaper at its retail price of $59.99. It’s full of surprises, too, including the best adaptation of Nintendo’s HD rumble that I’ve felt in a third-party controller. It’s also one of the few options that can remotely wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode via Bluetooth. Lastly, it includes amiibo support — another rare feature to find in a third-party gamepad.

However, the S10 isn’t a Switch 2 Pro copycat; it’s a lot grippier, both around the grips themselves and on its stick caps. Button presses and trigger pulls feel different from most other controllers, too, yielding a softer press and shorter travel, which is likely to be the most divisive aspect of the S10. One of my favorite aspects of the S10’s design is its swappable eight-way (circular) D-pad, making diagonal attacks in Hollow Knight: Silksong considerably easier to execute than with a four-way D-pad.

If I could change one thing about the S10, it’d be the system-level buttons (screenshot, GameChat, and home). They’re crammed awkwardly just below the D-pad and right stick.

Plain design, though it’s not necessarily bad

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two/ Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable battery, capacity undisclosed / Console wake-up: Yes

It’s getting easier to find wireless Switch 2 controllers for under $50 that closely match the features found on Nintendo’s pricier models (with some unexpected extras). The Mobapad N1 HD isn’t a new release — it was made for the original Nintendo Switch — yet it works great on Nintendo’s latest console after you update the firmware via Mobapad’s mobile or PC app. It can wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode, too, after you follow along with the one-time setup shown in this YouTube tutorial.

Like the EasySMX S10, the N1 HD features excellent rumble, amiibo support, motion controls, and a comfy, lightweight design. I prefer the S10’s slightly more weighty feel, but I don’t have much to complain about here. In fact, the N1 HD may get the nod in more blind tests since its grips are less coarse and abrasive. The Hall effect sticks and triggers feel great, and the buttons have a quiet yet tactile press. It doesn’t have a dedicated GameChat button, although I’m willing to forgive that omission because no one I know (including me) uses that feature.

The last thing that I want to shout out is that you can use the mobile app to customize the sound the N1 HD makes when it’s paired and when it turns off. The app has a little piano, and you can customize the sounds coming from each actuator. It’s just nice to hear “Jingle Bells” when I turn on my Switch 2.

Incredible value in terms of specs and comfort

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 950mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes

GuliKit’s ES Pro is a love letter to the Xbox controller, but for Switch 2. It’s just $29.99, which is a steal considering this gamepad features an eight-way D-pad that’s great for fighting games, Metroidvanias, and retro titles where it’s an advantage to easily be able to aim diagonally (a setting can make it so that it only registers inputs for the cardinal directions, if you prefer).

The ES Pro doesn’t need to do much to justify its price, but it does so anyway. It features tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks that are resistant to drifting and offer improved power efficiency compared to Hall effect tech, just like the EasySMX S10. Similarly, it can be set up to remotely wake your Switch 2 or OG Switch console from across the room using its own set of strange, one-time-only instructions that you can view in its instruction manual.

I’ve got almost no qualms with this controller, except for its bad rumble. It just has no subtlety, rumbling in an all-or-nothing manner. I was happier using the ES Pro with the vibrations off, which isn’t any fun. Additionally, it’s far less complete than the S10, as it lacks built-in amiibo support and a C button for GameChat; however, depending on your needs, those omissions might not matter to you.

Includes dock and 2.4GHz dongleHighly customizableComfortable for small hands

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes, two / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes

8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a great yet pricey Switch 2 Pro alternative with a PlayStation-style stick layout. At $69.99, it’s not as affordable (nor as value-packed) as the top contenders. However, the Pro 3 offers a lot of customization, some being cosmetic, while other aspects can impact gameplay.

It has a lot going for it, with TMR joysticks, two back paddles, and a total of three shoulder buttons per side thanks to new custom M buttons. Its analog stick caps can be popped off in favor of glossy arcade stick-style nubs, which were my preferred choice in fighting games (plus, they just look cool). Its ABXY buttons can be suctioned off with an included tool to swap the layout as needed, and for visual flair, each controller includes colored buttons to evoke a retro Nintendo console. Also, it has trigger locks, letting you set triggers to have a short, clicky pull or the default travel distance.

However, I’d skip the Pro 3 if you want good rumble feedback. It’s pretty lousy on that front, to the point that I preferred to turn off rumble entirely in games. In case you’re considering the similarly priced Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, it also has bad rumble, but it’s a great controller otherwise that offers similar features with an Xbox-style stick layout.

Cute, compact designCan wake Switch 2Hall effect sticks

Sticks and triggers have limited range Lacks features from the ES Pro

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No/ Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable 800mAh battery / Console wake-up: Yes

GuliKit Elves 2 is a compact, Sega Saturn-inspired controller I wanted to love a little more than I do. The affordable gamepad shares some of the same benefits as the identically priced ES Pro — including Switch 2 wake-up and multiplatform support — but it’s smaller, which could make it a great pick for kids or small-handed folks who have a difficult time wrapping their digits around larger gamepads.

There isn’t much wasted space in this controller, either, as it comes with a rechargeable battery, rumble motors, a gyroscope, and an eight-way D-pad that feels nice to use. Even for my medium-sized hands, its grips turn the small gamepad into something that’s satisfying to hold. I don’t like it as much for a handful of minor reasons relating to long-term comfort, button and trigger feel preferences, and some missing functionality. Compared to the ES Pro, it lacks TMR sticks (it has Hall effect), the Pro’s better triggers, and swappable buttons.

Since I last updated this post, I’ve received a few controllers that I’m still in the process of testing. GuliKit sent its TT Max and TT Pro wireless controllers, both of which have PlayStation-style stick layouts and TMR joysticks, along with adjustable stick tension, impressive rumble, and other interesting features that should make them contenders for this list. I’m also testing Mobapad’s Chitu2 controller. Its biggest claim is that it replicates the smooth action of Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller, in addition to other worthwhile features, like TMR joysticks. I’m expecting to receive an EasySMX S10 Lite to test soon, as well. It’s a cheaper version of the S10 that lacks amiibo but has what seems like every other feature found in the pricier model.

Update, January 9th: Adjusted pricing / availability, and updated the What’s next? section with some new entrants that I’m testing.

It may have been one of the smallest devices announced at CES 2026, but Lego’s new Smart Brick was also one of the most talked about debuts of the show. We’ve recognized it as the “Best in show” in our CES 2026 awards, and following the Smart Play system’s launch earlier this week, the first three sets featuring the new Smart Brick are now available for preorder.

Lego is introducing its Smart Brick to the world as part of three new sets in its popular Star Wars line that demonstrate many of the brick’s unique capabilities. The cheapest set is the $69.99, 473-piece Smart Play: Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter that includes one Smart Brick, one Smart Tag, and a Smart Darth Vader minifigure. The $89.99 SMART Play: Luke’s Red Five X-Wing is a 581-piece set that pairs the Smart Brick with five Smart Tags and Smart Luke and Leia figures.

The most expensive option is the $159.99 Smart Play: Throne Room Duel & A-Wing. It comes with 962 pieces including two Lego Smart Bricks, five Smart Tags, and Luke, Darth Vaders, and Emperor Palpatine smart figures. All three sets also include Lego’s new wireless charger that can accommodate two bricks at a time, and preorders are expected to start shipping on March 1st, 2026.

The Smart Brick functions as a tiny standalone computer that can be integrated into Lego builds to add interactive lighting and sounds. It features LEDs, a speaker, a mic, wireless connectivity, and a small collection of sensors that can detect movements, light, and gestures. It can recognize Lego’s new Smart Tags and figures through their embedded NFC tags, which trigger unique sounds or lighting effects based on which ones are nearby. They’re not programmable, but Lego says the Smart Brick can be updated with new features and content using a mobile app.

The reaction to the Smart Play system from Lego fans has been divided. Some are excited at the new play opportunities it introduces, while others lament Lego moving away from imagination-based play — despite this not being Lego’s first set to implement electronics. The Verge’s Sean Hollister had a chance to try out the Lego Smart Brick at CES 2026, and while he was skeptical at first, he walked away from a demo feeling the Smart Bricks were “far smarter and more imaginative than I expected.”

The developer clarified its stance on the technology in a Reddit AMA.

Following some controversy, the developers at Baldur’s Gate 3 creator Larian Studios have further clarified their use of generative AI. CEO Swen Vincke and other Larian developers held an AMA on Reddit where they answered users’ questions about the team’s next title, Divinity. They also fielded questions related to reports that the studio was using generative AI in its development process.

“So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity,” Vincke wrote in response to a question on Reddit. Last month, in an interview with Bloomberg, Vincke stated that while they weren’t using AI-generated assets in Divinity, the team was experimenting with AI tools “to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.”

His comments were immediately and fiercely criticized online by gamers, developers, and former Larian employees. In response, Vincke issued a statement clarifying that they were not using the tool to generate concept art, but as something artists could use to iterate on ideas faster.

Now, in the Reddit AMA, he says they won’t use it for concept art at all. “We’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development,” he wrote. “That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.” But Vincke did leave room for the possible use of gen AI assets in the future.

“If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own,” he wrote.

In addition to art, Larian also clarified gen AI usage with text. “We don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity,” wrote writing director Adam Smith. He said text generation was only for research, not development purposes, and that the results were too low-quality when compared to a human writer and Larian’s own standards.

“We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best,” Smith wrote. “Even my worst first drafts ... are at least a 4/10 ... and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous.”

While these comments might reassure players that at least gen AI assets won’t be in the final product, Vincke reaffirmed that gen AI would still play some role at Larian.

“Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.”

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story.

A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <h2>America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.
