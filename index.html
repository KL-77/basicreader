            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/i-cant-stop-shooting-oddcores-endless-waves-of-weird-little-guys/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since the days of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, the humble first-person shooter has flourished in myriad and complex directions. The genre has expanded in narrative and gameplay terms to include everything from sprawling sci-fi epics to dense objectivist allegories to multiplayer-focused military free-for-alls and practically everything in between.

Sometimes, though, you just want an excuse to shoot a bunch of weird little guys in weird little spaces.

For those times, there is Oddcore, a new Early Access, roguelike boomer shooter that is a stark contrast to the more sprawling self-serious shooters out there. The game’s combination of frenetic, quick-moving action, semi-randomized scenarios, and well-balanced risk/reward upgrade system makes for a pick-up-and-play shooter that I find myself struggling not to pick up and play for a few more quick-hit sessions even as I write this.

Oddcore begins with a wacky, bare-bones narrative about being trapped in some incomplete theme park resort with an “infinite room generator” that is on the fritz. After the quick tutorial, though, that narrative just serves as an excuse to throw you into a series of off-putting liminal spaces that make you feel like you’re trapped in a corrupted PlayStation 1 disc. Each of these low-res polygonal rooms slowly fills with malformed black-and-white demons, most of which run at you with a fanaticism straight out of Serious Sam, threatening to bite at your ankles or floating menacingly toward you while launching slow-moving pink projectiles at you.

This is not one of those shooters where you cower behind cover and pop up for a quick shot when it’s safe. More often than not, each “variant” arena is a more or less wide-open space where enemies can and will swarm in from every side. You’ll find yourself almost constantly backing away and strafing to avoid encroaching enemies while also keeping your head on a swivel to make sure there aren’t any new threats appearing behind you.

Oh, and did I mention that all this is happening on a tight five-minute timer that’s ticking down as you play? To extend an Oddcore session past that limit, you have to tap a button on your gun to create a portal to a weird shop dimension, where you can spend the souls of dead enemies for more in-game time. You can also spend those souls on a series of slow-machine randomized sets of upgrades to your health, attack speed, and assistance gadgets, or save up those souls to use as a quick health boost in the middle of a firefight.

Every new semi-randomized area you clear increases your total capacity to store souls, but every visit to the portal shop increases the additional “tax” you need to spend on every purchase. This makes the decision of when to warp away to the shop a persistent quandary—do you power up as quickly as possible to increase your chances of survival, or wait until you’ll be able to purchase even more power-ups a little later?

All the while, the enemies keep coming fast and furious, slowly getting faster, tougher, and more capable with each new zone you enter. Through it all, the tight controls, forgiving aim system, and wide variety of weapon and gadget options make every firefight fast, frenetic, and fun.

To keep things from getting too repetitive, you’ll sometimes get thrown into an arena where you have to chase down frolicking golden humanoid flowers or destroy a few giant ambulatory mushrooms—you know, standard tropes of the video game world. You’ll also occasionally get dropped into brief, intentionally off-putting, empty interstitial rooms that seem designed to surprise Twitch viewers more than fit some sort of coherent aesthetic, or “corruptions” that briefly prevent you from gaining health and/or warping away to the convenience shop for a breather.

Between runs, you can move around an ersatz redemption arcade to earn new weapons and gadgets and explore the miniature theme park setting, which is full of hidden crannies and unlockable play spaces. In a few hours of play, I’ve already stumbled on so many secrets by pure accident that I can only imagine unlocking them all will be a real undertaking (and I presume even more will be added as the game moves through Early Access).

The in-game leaderboards and achievements suggest that it is possible to “beat” Oddcore at some point, presumably by combining enough skill and lucky upgrades to power your way through dozens of variants in a single run. Frankly, I’m not sure I’ll ever master the game enough to reach that point. Even so, I’m happy to have a new excuse to take a brain break by shooting a bunch of weird little guys in weird little spaces for a few minutes at a time.</div>

            <h2>FBI fights leaks by seizing Washington Post reporter’s phone, laptops, and watch</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fbi-fights-leaks-by-seizing-washington-post-reporters-phone-laptops-and-watch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The FBI searched a Washington Post reporter’s home and seized her work and personal devices as part of an investigation into what Attorney General Pam Bondi called “illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor.”

Executing a search warrant at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson on Wednesday morning, FBI “agents searched her home and her devices, seizing her phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch,” The Washington Post reported. “One of the laptops was her personal computer, the other a Washington Post-issued laptop. Investigators told Natanson that she is not the focus of the probe.”

Natanson regularly uses encrypted Signal chats to communicate with people who work or used to work in government, and has said her list of contacts exceeds 1,100 current and former government employees. The Post itself “received a subpoena Wednesday morning seeking information related to the same government contractor,” the report said.

Post Executive Editor Matt Murray sent an email to staff saying that early in the morning, “FBI agents showed up unannounced at the doorstep of our colleague Hannah Natanson, searched her home, and proceeded to seize her electronic devices.” Murray’s email called the search an “extraordinary, aggressive action” that is “deeply concerning and raises profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work.”

The New York Times wrote that it “is exceedingly rare, even in investigations of classified disclosures, for federal agents to conduct searches at a reporter’s home. Typically, such investigations are done by examining a reporter’s phone records or email data.”

The search warrant said the probe’s target is “Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and has been accused of accessing and taking home classified intelligence reports that were found in his lunchbox and his basement,” the Post article said.

Bondi confirmed the search in an X post. “This past week, at the request of the Department of War, the Department of Justice and FBI executed a search warrant at the home of a Washington Post journalist who was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor. The leaker is currently behind bars,” Bondi wrote.

Bondi said the Trump administration “will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information” that “pose a grave risk to our Nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”

Searches targeting journalists require “intense scrutiny” because they “can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “Attorney General Bondi has weakened guidelines that were intended to protect the freedom of the press, but there are still important legal limits, including constitutional ones, on the government’s authority to use subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists. The Justice Department should explain publicly why it believes this search was necessary and legally permissible, and Congress and the courts should scrutinize that explanation carefully.”

Seth Stern, chief of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation, called the search “an alarming escalation in the Trump administration’s multipronged war on press freedom. The Department of Justice (and the judge who approved this outrageous warrant) is either ignoring or distorting the Privacy Protection Act, which bars law enforcement from raiding newsrooms and reporters to search for evidence of alleged crimes by others, with very few inapplicable exceptions.”

In April 2025, the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy that limited searches and subpoenas of reporters in leak investigations. But even the weaker Trump administration guidelines “make clear that it’s a last resort for rare emergencies only,” according to Stern. “The administration may now be in possession of volumes of journalist communications having nothing to do with any pending investigation and, if investigators are able to access them, we have zero faith that they will respect journalist-source confidentiality.”

The Washington Post didn’t say whether Perez-Lugones provided information to Natanson and pointed out that the criminal complaint against him “does not accuse him of leaking classified information he is alleged to have taken.”

Natanson does have many sources in the federal workforce. She wrote a first-person account last month of her experience as the news organization’s “federal government whisperer.” Around the time Trump’s second term began, she posted a message on a Reddit community for federal employees saying she wanted to “speak with anyone willing to chat.”

Natanson got dozens of messages by the next day and would eventually compile “1,169 contacts on Signal, all current or former federal employees who decided to trust me with their stories,” she wrote. Natanson explained that she was previously an education reporter but the paper “created a beat for me covering Trump’s transformation of government, and fielding Signal tips became nearly my whole working life.”

In another case this month, the House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena journalist Seth Harp for allegedly “doxxing” a Delta Force commander involved in the operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro. Harp called the doxxing allegation “ludicrous” because he had posted publicly available information, specifically an online bio of a man “whose identity is not classified.”

“There is zero question that Harp’s actions were fully and squarely within the protections of the First Amendment, as well as outside the scope of any federal criminal statutes,” over 20 press freedom and First Amendment organizations said in a letter to lawmakers yesterday.

The Trump administration’s aggressive stance toward the media has also included numerous threats from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to investigate and punish broadcasters for “news distortion.”

As for Perez-Lugones, he was charged last week with unlawful retention of national defense information in US District Court for the District of Maryland. Perez-Lugones was a member of the US Navy from 1982 to 2002, said an affidavit from FBI Special Agent Keith Starr. He has been a government contractor since 2002 and held top-secret security clearances during his Naval career and again in his more recent work as a contractor.

“Currently, Perez-Lugones works as a systems engineer and information technology specialist for a Government contracting company whose primary customer is a Government agency,” the affidavit said. He had “heightened access to classiﬁed systems, networks, databases, and repositories” so that he could “maintain, support, and optimize various computer systems, networks, and software.”

The affidavit said that “Perez-Lugones navigated to and searched databases or repositories containing classified information without authorization.” The FBI alleges that on October 28, 2025, he took screenshots of a classified intelligence report on a foreign country, pasted the screenshots into a Microsoft Word document, and printed the Word document.

His employer is able to retrieve records of printing activity on classified systems, and “a review of Perez-Lugones’ printing activity on that dates [sic] showed that he had printed innocuous sounding documents (i.e., Microsoft Word‐Document 1) that really contained classified and sensitive reports,” the affidavit said.

Perez-Lugones allegedly went on to access and view a “classified intelligence report related to Government operational activity” on January 5, 2026. On January 7, he was observed at his workplace taking notes on a yellow notepad while looking back and forth between the notepad and a computer that was logged into the classified system, the affidavit said.

Investigators executed search warrants on his home in Laurel, Maryland, and his vehicle on January 8. They found a document marked as SECRET in a lunchbox in his car and another secret document in his basement, the affidavit said.

Prior video surveillance showed Perez-Lugones at his cubicle looking at the document that was later found in the lunchbox, the affidavit said. Investigators determined that he “remov[ed] the classification header/footer markings from this document prior to leaving his workplace.”

The US law that Perez-Lugones was charged with violating provides for fines or prison sentences of up to 10 years. A magistrate judge ruled that Perez-Lugones could be released, but that decision is being reviewed by the court at the request of the US government.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-govt-house-sysadmin-stole-200-phones-caught-by-house-it-desk/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US House of Representatives, that glorious and efficient gathering of We the People, has been hit with yet another scandal.

Like most (non-sexual) House scandals, the allegations here involve personal enrichment. Unlike most (non-sexual) House scandals, though, this one involved hundreds of government cell phones being sold on eBay—and some rando member of We the People calling the US House IT help desk, which blew the lid on the whole scheme.

According to the government’s version of events, 43-year-old Christopher Southerland was working in 2023 as a sysadmin for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In his role, Southerland had the authority to order cell phones for committee staffers, of which there are around 80.

But during the early months of 2023, Southerland is said to have ordered 240 brand-new phones—far more than even the total number of staffers—and to have shipped them all to his home address in Maryland.

The government claims that Southerland then sold over 200 of these cell phones to a local pawn shop, which was told to resell the devices only “in parts” as a way to get around the House’s mobile device management software, which could control the devices remotely.

It’s hard to find good help these days, though, even at pawn shops. At some point, at least one of the phones ended up, intact, on eBay, where it was sold to a member of the public.

This member of the public promptly booted the phone, which did not display the expected device operating system screen but instead “a phone number for the House of Representatives Technology Service Desk.” The phone buyer called this number, which alerted House IT staff that government phones were being sold on eBay.

According to the government, this sparked a broader investigation to figure out what was going on, which revealed that “several phones purchased by Southerland were unaccounted for.” The full scheme is said to have cost the government over $150,000.

Southerland was indicted back in early December 2025 but not arrested until January 8, 2026. He pled not guilty and was quickly released on personal recognizance but was told to “stay away from US Capitol grounds.” He has a court date scheduled for later this month.

A LinkedIn account for Southerland claims skills with Python, Linux administration, and Microsoft systems like Azure and Active Directory. It also says that he is good at “coordinating complex projects involving multiple stakeholders” and “the updating of infrastructure, such as virtual environments to ensure the smooth operation of processes.”

“I have a passion for customer service and can interact with team members in a professional and courteous manner,” he writes.

Hopefully, he has a good explanation for all the cell phones. If not, this could be yet another case of an engineer believing that they are more clever than they really are—while being brought down by something surprisingly low-tech. Like trusting the pawn shop.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After weeks of sexualized images of women and children being generated with Grok with very limited interventions from Elon Musk’s xAI, California Attorney General Rob Bonta plans to investigate whether Grok’s outputs break any US laws.

In a press release Wednesday, Bonta said that “xAI appears to be facilitating the large-scale production of deepfake nonconsensual intimate images that are being used to harass women and girls across the Internet, including via the social media platform X.”

Notably, Bonta appears to be as concerned about Grok’s standalone app and website being used to generate harmful images without consent as he is about the outputs on X.

So far, X has not restricted the Grok app or website. X has only threatened to permanently suspend users who are editing images to undress women and children if the outputs are deemed “illegal content.” It also restricted the Grok chatbot on X from responding to prompts to undress images, but anyone with a Premium subscription can bypass that restriction, as can any free X user who clicks on the “edit” button on any image appearing on the social platform.

On Wednesday, Elon Musk seemed to defend Grok’s outputs as benign, insisting that none of the reported images have fully undressed any minors, as if that would be the only problematic output.

“I [sic] not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,” Musk said in an X post. “Literally zero.”

Musk’s statement seems to ignore that researchers found harmful images where users specifically “requested minors be put in erotic positions and that sexual fluids be depicted on their bodies.” It also ignores that X previously voluntarily signed commitments to remove any intimate image abuse from its platform, as recently as 2024 recognizing that even partially nude images that victims wouldn’t want publicized could be harmful.

In the US, the Department of Justice considers “any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a person less than 18 years old” to be child pornography, which is also known as child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which fields reports of CSAM found on X, told Ars that “technology companies have a responsibility to prevent their tools from being used to sexualize or exploit children.”

While many of Grok’s outputs may not be deemed CSAM, in normalizing the sexualization of children, Grok harms minors, advocates have warned. And in addition to finding images advertised as supposedly Grok-generated CSAM on the dark web, the Internet Watch Foundation noted that bad actors are using images edited by Grok to create even more extreme kinds of AI CSAM.

Bonta pointed to news reports documenting Grok’s worst outputs as the trigger of his probe.

“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” Bonta said. “This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the Internet.”

Acting out of deep concern for victims and potential Grok targets, Bonta vowed to “determine whether and how xAI violated the law” and “use all the tools at my disposal to keep California’s residents safe.”

Bonta’s announcement came after the United Kingdom seemed to declare a victory after probing Grok over possible violations of the UK’s Online Safety Act, announcing that the harmful outputs had stopped.

That wasn’t the case, as The Verge once again pointed out; it conducted quick and easy tests using selfies of reporters to conclude that nothing had changed to prevent the outputs.

However, it seems that when Musk updated Grok to respond to some requests to undress images by refusing the prompts, it was enough for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to claim X had moved to comply with the law, Reuters reported.

Ars connected with a European nonprofit, AI Forensics, which tested to confirm that X had blocked some outputs in the UK. A spokesperson confirmed that their testing did not include probing if harmful outputs could be generated using X’s edit button.

AI Forensics plans to conduct further testing, but its spokesperson noted it would be unethical to test the “edit” button functionality that The Verge confirmed still works.

Last year, the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence published research showing that Congress could “move the needle on model safety” by allowing tech companies to “rigorously test their generative models without fear of prosecution” for any CSAM red-teaming, Tech Policy Press reported. But until there is such a safe harbor carved out, it seems more likely that newly released AI tools could carry risks like those of Grok.

It’s possible that Grok’s outputs, if left unchecked, could eventually put X in violation of the Take It Down Act, which comes into force in May and requires platforms to quickly remove AI revenge porn. One of the mothers of one of Musk’s children, Ashley St. Clair, has described Grok outputs using her images as revenge porn.

While the UK probe continues, Bonta has not yet made clear which laws he suspects X may be violating in the US. However, he emphasized that images with victims depicted in “minimal clothing” crossed a line, as well as images putting children in sexual positions.

As the California probe heats up, Bonta pushed X to take more actions to restrict Grok’s outputs, which one AI researcher suggested to Ars could be done with a few simple updates.

“I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further,” Bonta said. “We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The prices that Americans paid for subscription- and rental-based access to video streaming services and video games increased 29 percent from December 2024 to December 2025, according to data that the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released on Tuesday.

According to the BLS, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which BLS says represents over 90 percent of the US population across the country, for all items “increased 2.7 percent before seasonal adjustment.”

The CPI-U for “subscription and rental of video and video games” includes subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) streaming services, like Netflix and Disney+, and “one-time rental of video and video game media. These may be rented or subscribed to through physical copy, streaming, or temporary download,” BLS says. For comparison, “cable, satellite, and live streaming television service [such as YouTube TV and Sling]” saw 4.9 percent inflation last year.

The index isn’t adjusted for the “effect of changes that normally occur at the same time and in about the same magnitude every year—such as price movements resulting from changing climatic conditions, production cycles, model changeovers, holidays, and sales,” per BLS. According to the federal agency, unadjusted data is “of primary interest to consumers concerned about the prices they actually pay.”

From November 2025 to December 2025 alone, subscription and rental of video and video games saw adjusted inflation of 19.5 percent, per BLS data.

Streaming and gaming subscriptions and rentals saw higher inflation in 2025 than any of the other CPI-U subcategories, which includes food. In that larger context, instant coffee (28 percent) saw the next highest inflation, followed by roasted coffee (18.7 percent), and uncooked beef steaks (17.8 percent).

We’ve begun to anticipate that streaming prices will climb faster than US inflation rates. But the 2025 data shows sharp increases from 2024. Per BLS, in 2024, streaming and gaming subscriptions and rentals saw unadjusted inflation of 1.6 percent from December 2023 to December 2024. The overall CPI-U for 2024 was 2.9 percent.

Subscription-based streaming companies have been leaning on price hikes to fight slow or stagnant subscription growth. With streaming now the primary method for Americans to watch TV, streaming service providers have been able to squeeze more cash out of customers.

Last year, virtually every mainstream streaming service, including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Apple TV, raised prices. Some smaller services, like Dropout and Discovery+, also started charging more as the broader industry grappled with the economic difficulties of providing constant, on-demand access to large libraries of costly, desirable, and original content and more typical business challenges, like increasing labor costs and appeasing investors.

Ads and password crackdowns have helped, but price hikes have also become common, especially since the initial prices of streaming services, built to lure people from traditional TV providers, weren’t sustainable long-term.

While there are economic reasons that streaming services have been steadily raising prices, price hikes seem more egregious when combined with user dissatisfaction around several areas: content quality and availability; ad frequency; ease in navigating apps and finding content across services; and apprehension around SVOD consolidation, such as Disney+ and Hulu, Fubo, and HBO Max with Netflix or Paramount.

Experts expect streaming prices to continue increasing in 2026. However, the price hikes may come in subtler forms, such as through upcharges for premium features like 4K. We also expect more streaming companies to bundle their subscription with other streaming or third-party services as they try to appear more cost-effective and deter cancellations.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Civilization VII is coming to the iPhone and iPad, Apple and publisher 2K announced today.

Formally titled Sid Meier’s Civilization VII Arcade Edition, it is developed by Behaviour Interactive with input from original developer Firaxis Games.

The game will be available as part of the Apple Arcade service, which offers ad-free games for Apple platforms for $7 per month. Neither announcement makes any mention of a non-Arcade version, so this appears to be exclusively part of the subscription.

That shouldn’t be too much of a surprise; full-priced premium games have struggled on the platform when not bundled in a subscription. For example, Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption came out both as a standalone title on the App Store and as part of Netflix’s subscription. The Netflix version surpassed a staggering 3.3 million downloads, while the $40 direct purchase managed just over 10,000.

The announcement calls this release “the authentic Civilization experience,” which you can probably take to mean that it doesn’t simplify the gameplay in any way. That said, there is some fine print you shouldn’t miss.

The App Store listing for the game says this release will not receive any of the DLC planned for other platforms. It also notes that “post-launch updates that apply to other platforms may be excluded or delayed.” Also, the supported players listed is “1,” suggesting it may not have multiplayer. (The desktop and console versions already lack hotseat multiplayer, but they support online play.)

Civilization VII launched to mixed reception in early 2025. We liked it when we reviewed it at Ars, despite some notable shortcomings in terms of polish and user interface, and it has a decent community of dedicated players. However, it makes enormous changes to the classic series’ formula, drawing ideas from competitors like Humankind. Many players feel it strayed too far, and there are still some frustrations with the user interface not showing enough information to players.

It has gotten a steady stream of updates since launch, though, and 2K seems committed to continuing to release content and patches.

This version of Civilization VII is expected to launch on February 5, and it will run on iPhone, Mac, and iPad. There’s no mention of Apple TV, and the App Store page specifically notes that Intel Macs aren’t supported, so you’ll need an M1 or later Mac.

Apple also announced a few other Arcade releases coming on February 5, including Felicity’s Door and I Love Hue Too+. There will also be Retrocade, a digital arcade that includes Asteroids, Bubble Bobble, Centipede, Galaga, and others. Notably, Retrocade will get a Vision Pro release that will let players play on simulated cabinets in a 3D virtual arcade space.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reportedly stole a teenage boy’s phone — and then seemingly pawned it afterwards for cash.

That detail comes from alarming new reporting from ProPublica that documents more than forty cases of ICE agents putting civilians in chokeholds and other moves that can block breathing.

One of these civilians was tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan, who was getting McDonald’s with his father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, when they were pulled over by masked agents. According to Arnoldo, after several agents violently tackled his father — who is undocumented — to the ground, with one pressing a knee into his neck, another put the 16-year-old in a suffocating chokehold. When he told the agent that he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.

“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”

Arnoldo took footage of the encounter, but his phone was confiscated after he was taken into custody. Later, when he used the Find My feature to track down his device, it led him to a vending machine for used electronics several miles away and near an ICE detention center, according to the reporting. Someone — we can only guess who — had apparently sold Arnoldo’s phone after ICE had confiscated it.

The idea of ICE stealing and then selling somebody’s phone is jarring.

“Not the key part of this story, obviously,” wrote tech journalist Mike Masnick in response, “but they *sold* his phone?”

“Yes,” ProPublica clarified, writing that “immigration agents not only took Arnoldo’s phone, the 10th grader had to use Find My Phone to locate it — in a vending machine for used electronics, close to an ICE detention center.”

Arnoldo’s story comes after the killing of a woman by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week becoming a flashpoint for ICE’s increasingly visible presence in several US cities, where they have brutalized civilians, wantonly detained both citizens and non-citizens alike, and clashed with onlookers and protestors. The woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, was shot by veteran ICE agent Jonathan Ross in her car after Good began turning her vehicle away from the officer. Moments after gunning her down, the agent can be heard calling Good a “f**king b**ch.”

President Trump defended the actions and accused Good of behaving “horribly,” and even asserted that she didn’t simply try to run the agent over, but had actually done so, despite every available shred of video evidence to the contrary.

After being detained and released by ICE, Arnoldo’s family took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff moved him to a trauma unit after identifying signs of the chokehold, according to ProPublica. Records show that doctors ordered dozens of CT scans and x-rays, including for his head, neck, and spine. His family says that the agents threatened to charge Arnoldo with assaulting an officer if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. The father is now in Mexico.

            <h2>Grok Is Getting Access to Classified Military Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/grok-pentagon-hegseth-war">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in December, Elon Musk’s pet chatbot Grok made headlines for casually distributing the private addresses and phone numbers of everyday people, scraping data from public sources with unsettling ease while other AI models refused. Now, that same model is being welcomed into a far more sensitive arena.

This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that Grok will be integrated into the Pentagon’s classified systems later this month as part of a sweeping, department-wide initiative to weaponize AI.

During a speech delivered to SpaceX employees at the company’s facility in Brownsville, Texas, Hegseth said he envisions a military AI that will operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications.” The Pentagon’s AI “will not be woke,” he added.

“We will not win the future by sprinkling AI onto old tactics like digital pixie dust,” Hegseth exclaimed. “We will win by discovering entirely new ways of fighting. That’s why we will run continuous experimentation campaigns, quarterly force-on-force combat labs with AI coordinated swarms, agent-based cyber defense, and distributed command and control.”

In addition to the Grok integration, Hegseth announced the creation of a new role within the Department of Defense, the “Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer,” to be filled by Cameron Stanley. Stanley was most recently the national security transformation lead at Amazon Web Services, a role he began after a lengthy career as as science and tech advisor at the Pentagon.

Musk’s Grok might be the perfect ideological match for Hegseth’s vision for the Pentagon going forward. Engineered by Musk to be an unhinged alternative to “woke” AI bots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Grok has already demonstrated a startling willingness to provide detailed instructions for unethical or illegal activities.

That alignment becomes clearer in light of the Pentagon’s recent campaigns, some of which are seen as illegal under international law. Under Hegseth, the DoD has orchestrated a number of brutal attacks against sovereign nations — including a ruthless campaign of murder against Venezuela, the scorching of Nigerian villages under the pretense of counter-terrorism, and the launch of least 134 air strikes on Somalia, which have killed scores of civilians and militants alike.

A tool like Grok would be particularly useful in this context. Though other AI models have their own ethics and safety issues, a Futurism survey of chatbots including ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot and Grok found that only the latter was willing to give operational suggestions for a “hypothetical invasion of Greenland.” The rest refused, citing international law and other ethical issues.

In choosing Grok, Hegseth has selected the tool of war which best mirrors his own darkest impulses — one that will reflect back on every air strike without a hint of remorse.

As if the moral rot wasn’t already deep enough, the Grok initiative comes just weeks after Republican lawmaker Lisa McClain’s husband purchased somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000 in xAI stock — the company behind Grok. The stock purchase, reported by Sludge, came just days after McClain met with Trump for a December 3rd White House event, and is yet another dubious stain on the administration’s track record with insider information.

            <h2>AI Has Basically Killed Stack Overflow</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2008, Stack Overflow has been an immensely helpful resource for developers, allowing them to crowdsource answers to their coding questions — and resulting in a vast online repository of coding knowledge.

But as Dev Class reports, the advent of generative AI appears to have caused an extinction-level event for the platform, with the number of monthly questions plummeting significantly since around the time ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022.

The data, as accessed through Stack Overflow’s own Data Explorer, tells a dramatic story. The number of questions per month fell from over 21,000 in January 2025 to a measly 3,607 by December. Back in the start of 2023, it was fielding 100,000 per month.

The issue? Large language model-based tools like OpenAI’s blockbuster chatbot have allowed programmers to get coding help with simple text prompts, foregoing the need to take their questions to Stack Overflow.

There’s a meta twist: Stack Overflow signed a partnership with OpenAI in 2024 in an effort to “strengthen the world’s most popular large language models” — either leaning into the inevitable or hastening its own demise, depending on your perspective.

It’s a confounding situation. The company introduced an “AI Assist” feature, described as a “new way for users to access our 17 years of expert knowledge,” last month. Yet, as Dev Class points out, using generative AI to answer questions on the platform is still banned.

Disillusioned users argued that the site’s often hostile and “toxic” community has contributed to its decline as well, criticizing the company for allowing moderators to mishandle duplicate queries, for instance. Many users have grown frustrated with being shut down for asking already-answered questions.

“Of course, one could point to 2022 and say ‘look, it’s because of AI,’ and yes, AI certainly accelerated the decline, but this is the result of consistently punishing users for trying to participate in your community,” one Reddit user argued. “People were just happy to finally have a tool that didn’t tell them their questions were stupid.”

Others pointed out that the most important questions simply may have already been asked.

“I very rarely find that I need to ask new questions on Stack Overflow,” another user wrote. “A problem is either trivial enough that I can find the answer myself, common enough that someone’s already asked before, or so difficult and so niche that asking other people for help is fruitless.”

Programmers are concerned about what comes next, especially considering the well-documented shortcomings of AI. Hallucinations are still a major issue, forcing developers to spend significant amounts of time fixing errors.

The more practical question: when new technologies are deployed, and Stack Overflow is a husk, where will the AIs get their coding info from?

Stack Overflow “was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions,” one user argued on Hacker News. “What do LLMs train off of now?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry continues to pour tens of billions of dollars into resource-intensive models and the infrastructure to run them. In the face of it all, their promises of kickstarting a technological revolution that could one day be immensely profitable remain convincing enough for investors to prop up sky-high valuations — at least for now.

But actually turning a profit is likely many years away for the vast majority of AI companies, and that’s if it ever comes. Who will stand to benefit from the rampant expenditures also remains a subject of heated debate, as corporations like Google, Meta, and OpenAI continue to race each other for dominance in the space.

Google and Meta already have successful businesses doing other things, but OpenAI doesn’t. That hasn’t stopped it from committing to spend well over $1 trillion before the end of the decade, an astronomical and extremely risky bet on scale even as its revenue lags. Users have shown a low willingness to pay for ChatGPT subscriptions, and the company has only begun exploring other revenue-generating avenues.

It all adds up to an enormous unanswered question: how long can OpenAI keep burning cash?

In a new essay for the New York Times, Sebastian Mallaby, senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Council on Foreign Relations, predicts that the Sam Altman-led company could run out of money “over the next 18 months.”

He argued that OpenAI’s competitors, industry stalwarts like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, could use the money they earned from their legacy businesses to pour hundreds of billions into developing and scaling their AI models — while OpenAI doesn’t have that luxury.

Mallaby is no AI hater. He’s extremely bullish on AI overall, arguing that “businesses usually take decades to deploy new technologies successfully,” whereas the AI industry has made “striking” progress in just three years.

In other words, Mallaby isn’t betting against a growing AI bubble — he’s singling out his predicted winners and losers of the ongoing AI race. And despite becoming a household name after the launch of ChatGPT just over three years ago, he expects OpenAI to become a footnote in AI history less than two years from now.

While OpenAI has raised record amounts of funding for a private company, the company is still “hemorrhaging cash,” burning through more than $8 billion in 2025 alone.

“Even if OpenAI reneges on many of those promises and pays for others with its overvalued shares, the company must still find daunting sums of capital,” Mallaby wrote. “However rich the eventual AI prize, the capital markets seem unlikely to deliver.”

After running out of cash, the researcher suggested that OpenAI could be “absorbed by Microsoft, Amazon or another cash-rich behemoth.”

But even with one of the biggest names in the game going under, Altman and his company will leave a lasting legacy behind, Mallaby argued.

An “OpenAI failure wouldn’t be an indictment of AI It would be merely the end of the most hype-driven builder of it,” he wrote.

Many other experts agree that 2026 could be a “make-or-break year” for OpenAI as pressure on the industry continues to mount.

Altman is holding onto his guns, declaring “code red” and doubling down on ChatGPT to keep up with the firm’s biggest competitor, Google.

“This is the WeWork story on steroids,” one venture capital boss, who is invested in one of OpenAI’s rivals, told The Economist last month. The coworking space company famously collapsed like a house of cards and went bankrupt in 2023 after years of turmoil, churning through billions of dollars by leasing and buying commercial real estate.

            <div id="article-text">A passenger bailed from his Waymo robotaxi as the vehicle drove dangerously close to an oncoming railcar.

Viral footage of the incident, which took place last Wednesday, shows the car blundering down a stretch of light rail tracks in Phoenix, Arizona, as if it were an actual motorist lane it was supposed to be driving in. The passenger, smelling trouble, exits the car during one of its random stops without looking back.

“Oh get out get out get out!” the bystander taking the footage can be heard saying. Moments later, a railcar a few hundred yards directly behind the Waymo can be briefly seen beginning to pull out from the station.

But the Waymo’s antics weren’t over yet. After driving again, it then suddenly stops as another railcar comes lumbering down the opposing pair of tracks, while the one behind it appears unsure of whether to proceed. Piling one bad decision on top of another, the robotaxi decides to start reversing, but doesn’t leave the track before the video ends.

@Waymo what happened here? passenger said im out🤣 #waymo #fyp #fail #tiktokfail #funny

A Valley Metro spokesperson said that Waymo was notified about the incident after an employee noticed the baffling spectacle.

“At approximately 9 a.m. on Wednesday morning, a Valley Metro employee observed an autonomous Waymo vehicle on the northbound light rail tracks near Southern Avenue and Central Avenue in Phoenix,” the spokesperson said, as quoted by local news station KTVK. “Light rail operations staff responded to the scene, and Waymo was contacted. To minimize service impacts, northbound and southbound trains exchanged passengers before reversing direction to continue service.”

Waymo robotaxis, despite touting an impressive safety record, have been known to get into all kinds of bizarre traffic contretemps, many of them dangerous. The cars have been caught driving on the wrong side of the road, getting stuck in roundabouts, blowing through police standoffs, and ignoring stopped school buses. The company also faced intense outrage after one of its self-driving cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco.

Scrutiny into the robotaxis’ safety and capabilities is higher than ever after seemingly its entire fleet went haywire during a power outage in the Bay Area last month, plunging the streets of San Francisco into chaos as the rudderless cabs piled up at intersections and blocked traffic.

Andrew Maynard, an emerging and transformative technology professor at Arizona State University, dismissed the latest Waymo incident as an edge case.

“I actually felt a little sorry for the car. It obviously made a bad decision and got itself in a difficult place,” Maynard told KTVK. “This is exactly one of those edge cases, what we call them. Something unexpected where the machine drove like a machine rather than a person.”

Waymo has not made a statement about the incident.

            <h2>Antarctica’s Former Largest Iceberg Is Now Completely Disintegrating</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enormous iceberg that split off from the Antarctic ice sheet decades ago has turned an alarmingly bright shade of vivid blue — an alarming indication that it’s about to undergo complete disintegration before the much warmer summer months are over.

When it first detached in 1986, the ice giant known as A-23A was twice the size of Rhode Island, becoming one of the largest and oldest bergs to be tracked by scientists, according to NASA. In January 2025, it measured around 1,410 square miles, earning it the Guinness world record for the largest existing iceberg.

It has since shrunk to a mere 456 square miles, roughly the size of Manhattan, by early January following several major pieces breaking off over the last year. According to data by the US National Ice Center, several other icebergs have now overtaken A-23A in terms of total square miles.

While the berg’s birth 40 years ago isn’t believed to have been the result of human-induced climate change, it’s yet another pertinent reminder that we will continue seeing massive icebergs, or “megabergs,” calving from the melting Antarctic ice shelf as global temperatures continue to climb and warm ocean waters.

A satellite image highlighted by NASA on its website last week shows the enormous iceberg “sopping with blue meltwater” as it drifts off the coast of the southern tip of South America — a “giant swimming pool, as New Scientist put it. The image, which was taken on December 26 by NASA’s Terra satellite, shows pools of deep blue water visible on its surface, which, according to experts are clear signs of “ongoing disintegration events.”

“You have the weight of the water sitting inside cracks in the ice and forcing them open,” explained University of Colorado Boulder senior research scientist Ted Scambos in a statement to NASA.

The blue diagonal stripes visible in the satellite image are of particular interest. Experts believe they’re scour marks that date back to a time when A-23A was dragged across Antarctic bedrock hundreds of years ago.

“The striations formed parallel to the direction of flow, which ultimately created subtle ridges and valleys on the top of the iceberg that now direct the flow of meltwater,” added National Snow & Ice Data Center senior research scientist Walt Meier told NASA. “It’s impressive that these striations still show up after so much time has passed, massive amounts of snow have fallen, and a great deal of melting has occurred from below.”

The situation is dire enough that scientists believe A-23A could be months, if not weeks, away from disintegrating completely.

“I certainly don’t expect A-23A to last through the austral summer,” retired University of Maryland Baltimore County scientist Chris Shuman told NASA.

At the current rate, temperatures are already around three degrees Celsius warmer than expected — such a disintegration could accelerate.

A-23A left the relatively shallow waters near the Antarctic ice shelf in 2020, and spent several years drifting and spinning. It almost collided with South Georgia island last year.

NASA described its deathwatch as a “bittersweet moment.”

“I’m incredibly grateful that we’ve had the satellite resources in place that have allowed us to track it and document its evolution so closely,” Shuman said. “A-23A faces the same fate as other Antarctic bergs, but its path has been remarkably long and eventful. It’s hard to believe it won’t be with us much longer.”

Meanwhile, scientists race to better understand how icebergs behave and how shrinking glaciers due to global warming affect their famously unpredictable behavior.

            <h2>Musk denies awareness of Grok sexual underage images as California AG launches probe</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk said Wednesday he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,” hours before the California Attorney General opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the “proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”

Musk’s denial comes as pressure mounts from governments worldwide — from the UK and Europe to Malaysia and Indonesia — after users on X began asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate sample gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

“This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”

The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law.

Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the Take It Down Act was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images – including deepfakes – and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own series of laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.

Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children towards the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.

According to some reports, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now requires a premium subscription before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators.

“Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said.

Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini. On January 3, X’s safety account said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women.

The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.

Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly.

Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater.

“For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said.

He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.

“Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.”

Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design.

“Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said.

TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.

The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. Indonesia and Malaysia have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has demanded that X make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the European Commission ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the UK’s online safety watchdog Ofcom opened a formal investigation under the UK’s Online Safety Act.

xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a “spicy mode” to generate explicit content. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as graphic and violent sexual images.

Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos.

“When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI announced Wednesday that it had reached a multi-year agreement with AI chipmaker Cerebras. The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, Cerebras said.

The deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also reported  the deal size.

Both companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.”

Cerebras has been around for over a decade but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings).

Cerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but, since then, has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to raise large amounts of money. On Tuesday, it was reported that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already an investor in the company, and that OpenAI once considered acquiring it.

“OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Netflix is increasing its investment in video podcasts, with its latest projects featuring famous comedian Pete Davidson and Cowboys Hall-of-Famer Michael Irvin.

The streaming giant announced on Wednesday two original video podcasts coming to the platform: Irvin’s “The White House,” streaming on January 19, and “The Pete Davidson Show,” debuting on January 30.

Both series, available only to Netflix subscribers, are designed to leverage the star power of their hosts. Davidson already has two comedy specials on the service that have performed well for the streamer. Meanwhile, Irvin stands out as a prominent figure in the sports world and was a big focus in Netflix’s documentary series “America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys.” His new show is likely to appeal to the millions of football fans who already subscribe to the service.

Davidson’s show will feature candid, behind-the-scenes conversations with friends from his own garage, airing every Friday, while Irvin’s show will deliver in-depth sports news, analysis, and commentary twice a week, joined by notable guest co-hosts like former NFL All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall.

These originals will join Netflix’s growing slate of video podcasts, alongside licensed titles from iHeartMedia, Spotify, and Barstool Sports such as Dear Chelsea, My Favorite Murder, and The Ringer. Notably, as part of these licensing agreements, these shows aren’t available in full on YouTube.

Wednesday’s news comes at a time when Netflix is increasingly trying to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the podcast space, with viewers watching over 700 million hours of podcasts per month on living room devices in 2025.

However, Netflix is still in the early stages of developing its podcast library. With millions of podcasts available across YouTube, Spotify, and other rival platforms, the vast array of choices poses a significant challenge for Netflix. If the company wants to grab a decent chunk of that audience, it’s got a lot of catching up to do.

Netflix’s chief technology officer, Elizabeth Stone, addressed the company’s podcast ambitions at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in October, discussing how the expansion into video podcasts represents part of a broader strategy to explore new interactive content types.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/app-downloads-declined-again-in-2025-but-consumer-spending-soared-to-nearly-156b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The subscription economy helped boost mobile app revenues in 2025, even as app downloads declined for the fifth consecutive year, according to app intelligence firm Appfigures‘ annual report. In 2025, global downloads of all mobile apps and mobile games via the App Store and Google Play reached an estimated 106.9 billion, 2.7% lower than the year prior. Consumer spending, meanwhile, climbed 21.6% to reach an estimated $155.8 billion during the same period.

The data indicates that app developers, marketers, and publishers have been successful in getting their users to make in-app purchases or activate subscriptions, even as the number of new users downloading apps has been falling.

The report also reflected the continued shift away from mobile games as the primary revenue driver for the app economy. In 2025, consumers spent $72.2 billion on mobile games, accounting for about 46% of all spending within mobile apps. While that figure is up 10% year-over-year, spending on non-game mobile apps also increased. In fact, non-game app spending is up 33.9% year-over-year and reached $82.6 billion in 2025, Appfigures said.

While consumers may not like that nearly every app now has in-app purchases or a subscription model built in, this has offered a more sustainable path for app developers. Plus, the shift toward ongoing payments for apps has helped fuel an ecosystem of businesses serving the mobile app ecosystem. This includes subscription management platform RevenueCat, which raised a $50 million Series C this past year, and Appcharge, a startup helping mobile games improve their monetization, which announced a $58 million Series B back in August. This week, Liftoff Mobile, which helps market and monetize apps, filed for an IPO.

As revenue rose, downloads dropped again in 2025.

After reaching an all-time high of 135 billion in 2020 during the pandemic, downloads have been on the decline. This year’s figure of 106.9 billion installs was down from 109.8 billion in 2024, and follows slowed download growth between 2023 and 2024, when installs were down 3.3%.

Mobile game downloads saw a larger decline this year. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, down 8.6% year-over-year, after a 6.6% decline from 2023 to 2024. Non-game app downloads were essentially flat — they only saw a slight increase of 1.1% year-over-year, reaching 67.4 billion.

The full report also takes a look at the U.S. market specifically. Here, consumers spent an estimated $55.5 billion across all mobile apps, up 18.1% year-over-year from $47 billion in 2024. Downloads reached 10 billion, down 4.2% from the 10.4 billion in 2024. U.S. consumers spent $33.6 billion on non-game apps, up 26.8% year-over-year, and spent $21.9 billion on games, up just 6.8%.

U.S. non-game app downloads were an estimated 7.1 billion in 2025, while games were downloaded 2.9 billion times.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out.

“I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.

ChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.

For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.

Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.

Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.

The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play.

On Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.”

“As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued.

Another driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.

For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.”

            <div id="article-text">With news that Discord is kicking the tires on going public soon, other tech companies are starting to take their chances. Liftoff Mobile filed its first S-1 document late Tuesday, the first step in the process.

The company isn’t yet discussing how big this IPO will be: It has not yet filled in any data about the size of the offering or the stakes held by its principal shareholders. However, the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital reports the whisper number at $400 million, meaning that’s what the street thinks the company hopes to raise.The company offers a platform that helps mobile app developers market their apps and was formed in 2021 through a merger of Liftoff and Vungle. Blackstone acquired the majority of its shares at the time and the finance giant also appointed new leadership, meaning it is no longer a founder-run company. After the offering, Blackstone will remain the majority shareholder, according to the S-1 filing.

Another interesting tidbit: This listing, despite its relatively small expected size, has an unusually large number of bankers underwriting it. The offering has three joint lead bankers (Goldman, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley) and another 12 banks assisting to sell, plus three other financial institutions, including Blackstone, involved. Whew! That could either be a sign of strong investor interest or the need to spread risk across many institutions.

Liftoff claims 140,000 apps use its services. It says it had 2025 revenues of over $519 million and a net loss of just over $48 million. The company also says it is carrying over $1.85 billion in debt.

Welcome back to Atlantic Trivia! Are you hungry for more?

I hope that while I’ve been away, you have been enjoying plenty of food for thought—literally. Research shows that berries help improve memory and that a walnut-heavy diet is associated with higher cognitive performance. Fatty fish and leafy greens are linked to slower cognitive decline. Caffeine is a brain boost too.

A challenge: Combine all these ingredients, Chopped-style, into the perfect pre-trivia meal.

Meanwhile, I have been away these past few weeks thinking mostly about chicken parmigiana. It’s not brain food per se, but I reckon we can call it creativity fuel—so long as it’s eaten for breakfast. That is the suggestion in the first edition of my new newsletter, Better With Time, an eight-week course of ways to add oomph to various parts of the day. Sign up for it here.

And by the way, did you know that mitochondria can be shared among cells? If needed—often in instances of cellular distress—the organelles travel from one cell to another via little bridges called tunneling nanotubes.

I cannot help but anthropomorphize this incredible phenomenon: a knock at the cell membrane. Neighbor, can I borrow a cup of adenosine triphosphate?

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that when the aforementioned dynasty took power in 1925, its country was still known to the world as Persia? It wasn’t until 1935 that the shah asked the international community to start calling the place Iran, to better reflect its makeup (not all Iranians are ethnically Persian).

This was generally accommodated. Then Winston Churchill got involved; the British premier worried that the new name was too close to Iraq’s and would cause confusion during World War II, when both countries were occupied by the Allies. He requested a temporary swap back, and the Iranians—or Persians?—amazingly agreed.

And by the way, did you know that venison, which comes from the Latin for “to hunt,” once referred to any wild game? That meant deer, but also hare, boar, some goats, and elk and their ilk.

That catchall spirit lives on today in South Africa. Because the country’s continent has no native deer species, venison there means meat from eland, kudu, gemsbok, springbok, or impala—which, to save you a search, are all species of antelope.</div>

            <h2>Jeff Bezos Needs to Speak Up</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the government stomps on some once-inviolable right, it may be carrying out the next step in a concerted plan, or it may just be stumbling clumsily. The proper response in these moments is not to wax hysterical, but instead to draw clear moral lines. That is especially true for powerful people with the ability to make themselves heard.

This morning, FBI agents searched the home of the Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson and seized her devices, allegedly as part of a leak investigation targeting sources she had covered.

Journalists are supposed to enjoy legal protections from raids such as this, because courts have recognized that if the government could treat them as criminals for acquiring nonpublic information, their work—protected by the First Amendment—would become impossible. Gray areas do exist, and previous administrations have often tangled with the media over where to draw the line between legitimate investigations of important government secrets and impingement upon the free press.

Depending on what facts the FBI produces, the raid of Natanson’s home may lie within that traditional gray area. But there are reasons it may portend something more ominous.

Paul Farhi: Trump’s campaign to crush the media

One is that Donald Trump refuses to accept the legitimacy of an independent media. He has repeatedly described media outlets whose reporting he doesn’t approve of as operating illegally, and has threatened more than a dozen times to remove the broadcast license of offending outlets. In his first term, he retaliated against The Washington Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, by withholding a lucrative Pentagon contract from Amazon.

In his second term, Trump has learned to apply this pressure more pointedly. He has made it plain that owners of large media firms should expect much friendlier regulatory treatment if they bring to heel the journalists they employ. What makes this tactic so deviously effective is that many influential media outlets are just a tiny portion of their owners’ business interests. The Ellisons own CBS News, but CBS News is a speck in their financial portfolio. Losing audience share for 60 Minutes because the show relinquishes its independence would be an insignificant financial setback, but losing the administration’s approval for the Ellisons’ merger bids would be catastrophic.

The same logic applies to Bezos. Companies he founded take in billions of dollars in federal space and defense contracts, and require the government’s approval for satellite communications. Bezos has good reason to worry that the fate of these companies is tied to Trump’s feelings toward the Post, a newspaper whose gains or losses amount to a rounding error. Bezos has sent a procession of compliant signals: replacing the Post’s leadership and its writers for its editorial page with more conservative figures, spiking the newspaper’s presidential endorsement, and appearing at Trump’s inauguration in a Putin-esque display of oligarchic cooperation.

The question that has hung over the Post since Bezos’s heel turn has been whether he is still willing to protect the paper from a president who yearns to subdue it. He could answer the question by speaking out forcefully in defense of his journalists and their right to report on the government without intimidation. Or he could continue to remain silent, which, in its own way, is also an answer.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic is introducing Premium Plus, a subscription that includes family- and friend-sharing, among other exclusive benefits. This is the first new tier The Atlantic has introduced since it launched a digital subscription in late 2019, and after many years of dramatic subscription growth, The Atlantic is now one of the largest news magazines in the country, with well over 1.4 million subscriptions.  Premium Plus benefits include unlimited access for up to four people, one of the most requested features among existing subscribers; a keepsake coffee-table book created exclusively for Premium Plus; and a colorful version of its iconic tote. With the addition of this tier, The Atlantic now has four annual subscription packages, along with an academic rate for students and educators: Premium Plus, at $199; Premium, at $120, which allows sharing for one gift subscription; Print + Digital, starting at $89; and Digital, starting at $79. All subscriptions include full digital access to all of The Atlantic’s journalism, audio, archives, newsletters, and games, along with subscriber-only podcasts, early access to new podcast episodes such as the new season of Autocracy in America, and virtual events.  The Atlantic scrapbook, developed by Creative Director Peter Mendelsund and the editorial team, showcases original art and design, photography, and text from across the magazine’s 168 years. In a forward, Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg writes: “We have made this compendium of Atlantic words and art and photography and history because we love our magazine and want to share its omnivorous greatness with our faithful readers.” The book contains treasures such as a handwritten draft of Julia Ward Howe’s “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” first purchased by The Atlantic for $5 and published in the February 1862 issue; a letter from contributing writer Mark Twain in 1903, who resented paying for a subscription; and recent photography from cover stories about the Maasai in Tanzania and the journey across the Darién Gap.  The Atlantic has been significantly expanding its reach over the past decade. Last year, The Atlantic added more than 50 journalists to its staff as part of a major editorial expansion; launched broader coverage of defense, national security, technology, health, and science; began publishing two more print issues annually; introduced a Games hub; launched its first video podcasts; and began offering free digital access to every public U.S. high school. It recently launched The Atlantic Across America, a nationwide tour that will hold events in all 50 states over the next three years. The magazine continues to set new records for subscribers and overall revenue.  Press Contacts: Anna Bross and Paul Jackson | The Atlantic [email protected]</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the holidays, Alex Lieberman had an idea: What if he could create Spotify “Wrapped” for his text messages? Without writing a single line of code, Lieberman, a co-founder of the media outlet Morning Brew, created “iMessage Wrapped”—a web app that analyzed statistical trends across nearly 1 million of his texts. One chart that he showed me compared his use of lol, haha, 😂, and lmao—he’s an lol guy. Another listed people he had ghosted.

Lieberman did all of this using Claude Code, an AI tool made by the start-up Anthropic, he told me. In recent weeks, the tech world has gone wild over the bot. One executive used it to create a custom viewer for his MRI scan, while another had it analyze their DNA. The life optimizers have deployed Claude Code to collate information from disparate sources—email inboxes, text messages, calendars, to-do lists—into personalized daily briefs. Though Claude Code is technically an AI coding tool (hence its name), the bot can do all sorts of computer work: book theater tickets, process shopping returns, order DoorDash. People are using it to manage their personal finances, and to grow plants: With the right equipment, the bot can monitor soil moisture, leaf temperature, CO2, and more.

Some of these use cases likely require some preexisting technical know-how. (You can’t just fire up Claude Code and expect it to grow you a tomato plant.) I don’t have any professional programming experience myself, but as soon as I installed Claude Code last week, I was obsessed. Within minutes, I had created a new personal website without writing a single line of code. Later, I hooked the bot up to my email, where it summarized my unread emails, and sent messages on my behalf. For years, Silicon Valley has been promising (and critics have been fearing) powerful AI agents capable of automating many aspects of white-collar work. The progress has been underwhelming—until now.

Read: Was Sam Altman right about the job market?

This is “bigger” than the ChatGPT moment, Lieberman wrote to me. “But Pandora’s Box hasn’t been opened for the rest of the world yet.” Claude Code has seemingly yet to take off outside Silicon Valley: Unlike ChatGPT, Claude Code can be somewhat intimidating to set up, and the cheapest version costs $20 a month. When Anthropic first released the bot in early 2025, the company explicitly positioned it as a tool for programmers. Over time, others in Silicon Valley—product managers, salespeople, designers—started using Claude Code, too, including for noncoding tasks. “That was hugely surprising,” Boris Cherny, the Anthropic employee who created the tool, told me.

The bot’s popularity truly exploded late last month. A recent model update improved the tool’s capabilities, and with a surplus of free time over winter break, seemingly everyone in tech was using Claude Code. “You spent your holidays with your family?” wrote one tech-policy expert. “That’s nice I spent my holidays with Claude Code.” (On Monday, Anthropic released a new version of the product called “Cowork” that’s designed for people who aren’t developers, but for now it’s only a research preview and is much more expensive.)

I can see why the tech world is so excited. Over the past few days, I’ve spun up at least a dozen projects using the bot—including a custom news feed that serves me articles based on my past reading preferences. The first night I installed it, I stayed up late playing with the tools, sleeping only after maxing out my allowed usage for the second time that evening. (Anthropic limits usage.) The next morning, I maxed it out again. When I told a friend to try it out, he was skeptical. “It sounds just like ChatGPT,” he told me. The next day he texted with a gushing update: “It just DOES stuff,” he said. “ChatGPT is like if a mechanic just gave you advice about your car. Claude Code is like if the mechanic actually fixed it.”

Part of what works so well about Claude Code is that it makes it easy to connect all sorts of apps. Sara Du, the founder of the AI start-up Ando, told me that she is using it to help with a variety of life tasks, like managing her texts with real-estate agents. Because the bot is hooked up to her iMessages, she can ask it to find all of the Zillow links she’s sent over the past month and compile a table of listings. “It gives me a lot of dopamine,” Du said. Andrew Hall, a Stanford political scientist, had Claude Code analyze the raw data of an old paper of his studying mail-in voting. In roughly an hour, the bot replicated his findings and wrote a full research paper complete with charts and a lit review. (After a UCLA Ph.D. student performed an audit of the bot’s paper, he and Hall offered a “subjective conclusion”: Claude Code made only a few minor errors, the kind that a human might make.) “It certainly was not perfect, but it was very, very good,” Hall told me. AI is not yet a substitute for an actual political-science researcher, but he does think the bot’s abilities raise major questions for academia. “Claude Code and its ilk are coming for the study of politics like a freight train,” he posted on X.

Not everyone is so sanguine. The bot lacks the prowess of an excellent software engineer: It sometimes gets stuck on more complicated programming tasks—and occasionally trips up on simple tasks. As the writer Kelsey Piper has put it, 99 percent of the time, using Claude Code feels like having a tireless magical genius on hand, and 1 percent of the time, it feels like yelling at a puppy for peeing on your couch.

Regardless, Claude Code is a win for the AI world. The luster of ChatGPT has worn off, and Silicon Valley has been pumping out slop: Last fall, OpenAI debuted a social network for AI-generated video, which seems destined to pummel the internet with deepfakes, and Elon Musk’s Grok recently flooded X with nonconsensual AI-generated porn. But Claude Code feels materially different in the way it presents obvious, immediate real-world utility—even if it also has the potential to be used to objectionable ends. (Last fall, Anthropic discovered that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had used Claude Code to conduct a sophisticated cyberespionage scheme.) Whatever your feelings on the technology, the bot is evidence that the AI revolution is real.

In fact, Claude Code could turn out to be an inflection point for AI progress. A crucial step on the path to artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is thought to be “recursive self-improvement”: AI models that can keep making themselves better. So far, this has been largely elusive. Cherny, the Claude Code creator, claims that might be changing. In terms of “recursive self-improvement, we’re starting to see early signs of this,” he said. “Claude is starting to come up with its own ideas and it’s proposing what to build.” A year ago, Cherny estimates that Claude Code wrote 10 percent of his code. “Nowadays, it writes 100 percent.”

Read: Things get strange when AI starts training itself

If Claude Code ends up being as powerful as its biggest supporters are promising, it will be equally disruptive. So far, AI has yet to lead to widespread job losses. That could soon change. Annika Lewis, the executive director of a crypto foundation who described herself as “fairly nontechnical,” recently used the bot to build a custom tool that scans her fridge and suggests recipes in order to minimize grocery-store runs. Next she wants to hook it up to Instacart so it can order her groceries. In fact, Lewis thinks the bot could help with all kinds of work, she told me. She has two young kids, and had been considering hiring someone to help out with household administrative work such as finding birthday-party venues, registering the kids for extracurricular activities, and booking dental appointments. Now that she has Claude Code, she hopes to automate much of that instead.</div>

            <h2>Trump Is Risking a Global Catastrophe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-greenland-risk-global-conflict/685616/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump has a lot of odd fixations, both as a person and as a president. He tends to focus his tunnel vision on things he wants: the demolishing of the White House’s East Wing, the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. Many of Trump’s quirks are harmless, if unpleasant. (He seems to hate dogs, for example, but no one is forcing him to adopt one.) Some of his ideas, however, are more destructive: His stubborn and ill-informed attachment to tariffs has brought about considerable disorder in the international economy and hurt many of the American industries they were supposed to protect.

But a few of Trump’s obsessions are extraordinarily dangerous, and likely none more so than his determination to seize Greenland from Denmark, a country allied to the United States for more than two centuries. Perhaps because he does not understand how the Mercator projection distorts size on a map, the president thinks that Greenland is “massive” and that it must become part of the United States. If Trump makes good on his recurring threat to use force to gain the island, he would not only blow apart America’s most important alliance; he could set in motion a series of events that could lead to global catastrophe—or even to World War III.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: Denmark’s army chief says he’s ready to defend Greenland

Greenland, of course, is important to the security of the United States—as it is to the entire Atlantic community and to the free world itself. This fact might be new to Trump, but Western strategists have known it for a century or more, which is why the United States has had a military presence in Greenland for decades.

During the Cold War, America and its allies were determined to defend the sea lanes between Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom (often referred to at the time as the “GIUK” gap), the North Atlantic passages through which the Soviet Union could have sent submarines from its Arctic bases toward NATO convoys trying to reach Europe. America and Denmark have always worked closely in the Arctic region, and even once had a secret “gentlemen’s agreement” under which Denmark declared Greenland off-limits for the stationing of nuclear weapons, but would look the other way so long as the United States kept the presence of any such weapons quiet and unacknowledged. (The U.S. Air Force, in a rather flexible reading of that agreement, flew nuclear-armed B-52 bomber patrols over Greenland; one of them crashed and scattered radioactive debris on the island in 1968.)

The Cold War is over, but Greenland is still an important part of North Atlantic security, which is one of many reasons Denmark and the United States and other North Atlantic nations are part of a thing called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But for the Trump administration, NATO—another of the president’s hostile fixations—is not enough to guarantee America’s safety. Trump, like the mad president in the 1965 novel Night of Camp David, seems to believe that the United States must absorb Canada and Greenland and create some sort of Atlantic co-prosperity sphere stretching from Alaska to Norway, a ring of ice and iron that would stand as a tribute to the imperial ambitions of America’s 47th president.

In Trump’s first term, he made overtures about buying Greenland, as if the territory and its people were just a house on the market, available for purchase with all of its original furniture and fixtures. Neither the Danes nor the Greenlanders were interested, and the whole scheme faded away once Trump was immersed in the series of scandals and outrages that led to his loss in 2020 and his attempted coup against the Constitution in 2021. When voters returned Trump to office in 2024, his electoral affirmation seemed to strengthen his determination to do all the things that the responsible adults in his previous administration told him he couldn’t do the first time around.

The idea of a purchase is, in theory, still on the table. Denmark is still not selling. At this point, Trump is so consumed with acquiring Greenland that he has implied that he would use force against an old American friend, if that’s what it takes to get the island. “I would like to make a deal the easy way,” Trump said last week, “but if we don’t do it the easy way, we’re going to do it the hard way.” (He added, in one of his verbal tics, that he’s “a fan” of Denmark, as if it were a sports team or a rock band and not an allied nation of 6 million people located fewer than 1,000 miles from Russia.)

As Trump’s rhetoric has escalated, other administration officials have tried to clean up his remarks, but with little success. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dutifully met with members of Congress to reassure them that Trump intended only to offer to buy the island, but the next day, the White House issued a statement reaffirming that “utilizing” the military “is always an option.” The same week that Rubio was on the Hill, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on January 5 scoffed at the idea that seizing Greenland would lead to armed conflict, because “nobody’s going to fight the United States” over Greenland. (A few days earlier, his wife, Katie, also a White House aide, posted a picture on social media of an American flag superimposed over Greenland, with the comment: “SOON.”)

The president’s obsession with Greenland is especially dangerous because it has no real constituency: Trump is determined to get the island, it seems, only because Denmark and the rest of the world are telling him that he can’t have it. As is so often the case, telling Trump not to do something makes him more determined to do it.

Even the loyal MAGA base has shown no interest in Greenland, or at least not yet; the president’s supporters, of course, usually end up supporting whatever he wants. But so far, taking Greenland is not a chant or talking point on the same level as, say, building a wall along the Mexican border once was. In fact, polls show that most Americans oppose the whole idea. Even so, that didn’t stop Randy Fine, who represents Florida’s Sixth Congressional District, from introducing the Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act on Monday. Perhaps Fine’s constituents in Palatka or Pierson are clamoring for a victory parade in Nuuk, but this idea seems to have possessed Trump and almost no one else, which means the president may choose to get it done with the only instrument that he feels is totally within his control: the United States Armed Forces.

This morning, Denmark sent an advance military command to Greenland in preparation for sending yet more Danish forces to the island. Danish lawmakers told my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker last week that the timing of this deployment is not a coincidence and represents an attempt to create a “credible deterrent” on the island—presumably to the Americans. This afternoon, the foreign ministers of both Denmark and Greenland met with Vice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House, and, clearly, got nowhere: Both ministers reiterated that any solution to Trump’s “concerns” that does not respect the territorial sovereignty of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark is “totally unacceptable.” (The Danish foreign minister called these Denmark’s “red lines” on the matter.)

The Danes are not going to hand over Greenland; the Greenlanders will not vote to become part of the United States. What, exactly, is left for Trump to do, and what will happen if he takes Greenland over the objections of Denmark and NATO?

As my colleagues Shane Harris, Isaac Stanley-Becker, and Jonathan Lemire reported recently, Danish officials are concerned that Trump will simply issue a late-night proclamation that the United States owns Greenland and then dare anyone to contradict him. The international community has become inured to many of the president’s grandiose statements, and Trump declaring himself Lord Protector of Greenland might not have much impact.

But Trump might then try to enforce his claims. He could start by ordering the U.S. military to treat Greenland as sovereign U.S. territory. And such an order, which would be illegal but would likely be fulfilled by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s Pentagon, could set in motion a disastrous chain of events.

Assume, for example, that Denmark closes Greenland’s airspace to U.S. flights in order to assert its continued sovereignty (and to prevent Trump from sending more troops to the island). Trump might then order the Air Force to ignore any directions from local authorities—because, of course, Greenland would now be American airspace—and to treat all such encounters as potentially hostile. Or imagine that Denmark, following some intemperate claim from Trump, demands that U.S. forces in Greenland remain confined to their bases, and Trump, incensed at the insult to his putatively unlimited power, tries to force the issue and tells American servicepeople to act as the island’s de facto police, including suppressing any demonstrations or resistance from the population.

Either by design or accident, members of the American military might end up confronting Danish forces, men and women with whom they have trained for years and may have served in Afghanistan. Someone might be killed. The death of a Greenlander, a Dane, or a member of any other military there as a show of support for Denmark—Sweden has already sent troops to Greenland and Britain is considering similar moves—would incinerate the NATO alliance. Then the real nightmare begins.

The United States is already overstretched around the world because of Trump’s chaotic threats and impulses. Ships that should be in the Gulf or near Europe or Asia are paddling around in the Caribbean because of Trump’s operation to remove the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro from power. The president has threatened to attack Iran, again, if the regime in Tehran continues to kill its own citizens, and U.S. forces would have to dart back across the world to undertake new assignments in the Middle East. Of course, such a move would undermine Trump’s ongoing warnings that he might strike Mexico and Colombia.

As the American military chases Trump’s ever-changing Sharpie lines across the world’s maps, the West’s enemies will be tempted to take advantage of the fact that the United States has obliterated the most powerful alliance in history while scattering American forces around the globe in showpiece operations that have more to do with Trump’s vanity than with sound strategy. They have surely noticed that the U.S. defense and intelligence services are in the hands of unqualified loyalists, and that so far Trump’s plans for improving the battle readiness of the American military are mostly limited to pictures of make-believe battleships that will never be built.

If NATO collapses because of bullets fired in Greenland, Russian President Vladimir Putin might well assume that he could bury the Atlantic Alliance once and for all by attacking NATO’s Baltic members. As the political scientist Ian Bremmer, who founded the analytical firm Eurasia Group, said on social media this week, “Nobody wants the United States to take control of Greenland (and, accordingly, destroy NATO) more than Putin.” The Russians don’t need to fully occupy Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; the point would be to start a war aimed at isolating them. (The three countries together are about the size of Wisconsin.) Putin has taken ghastly losses in Ukraine, but he has enough of an army left, backed by drones and other assets, to pummel the Baltic states and grab pieces of territory that may have no strategic value but whose capture would serve to remind the world that the United States—the new masters of Greenland—will not save Europe.

Other nations, however, are unlikely to sit by, especially neighboring NATO countries such as Poland and Finland. Should they come to the aid of their Baltic allies, at least some other European nations would likely support those efforts, and the result would be a broader European conflict involving some of the most militarily capable states in the world. For the first time in almost a century, the continent would be at war, this time one involving multiple nuclear powers. U.S. forces, like it or not, would find themselves in the middle of this bedlam, and with each day of violence the chances would grow of a cataclysmic mistake or miscalculation by any of the combatants.

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

Meanwhile, a world away from Europe, China might wonder if America has finally tied itself in enough foolish knots to put the conquest of Taiwan within reach, especially with Trump’s “Golden Fleet” nowhere in sight. And although no one should try to predict what North Korea’s bizarre dynasty would do, South Korea and Japan would have to begin planning for the risks that will come during, and after, America’s voluntary strategic immolation, most likely with crash programs to develop nuclear arms.

And all this could happen—for what, exactly? The vainglorious demands of one man who can’t read a map?

Concerned leaders in both parties should explain to the citizens of the United States how much peril Trump is courting. His obsessions could lead not only to the collapse of their standard of living but present a real danger to their lives, no matter where they live. Congress, of course, should have stopped Trump—on this as on so many things—long ago. The Republican majority has the power to put an end to this lunacy by closing its purse strings and passing laws directly forbidding further adventures: Yesterday, Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen introduced the NATO Unity Protection Act, which explicitly prohibits using Federal funding “to blockade, occupy, annex or otherwise assert control over the sovereign territory of a NATO member state without that ally’s consent.” This is one case where the MAGA base, which claims to hate foreign adventures, might forgive the GOP for opposing Trump.

Most Americans probably couldn’t care less about Greenland, but they will be forced to care—tragically, too late—if Trump’s gambit engulfs the world in flames.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum discusses the menacing crises the Trump presidency is inflicting on the United States and its own movement to start 2026. David speculates that the recent lethal ICE incident in Minneapolis, the growing erraticism of Trump&#39;s rhetoric, and the targeting of Jerome Powell indicate that MAGA world is cracking. He argues that Trump’s unpredictable and escalating actions are taking the MAGA movement, the Trump presidency, the U.S., and the rest of the world down a path of doom.

Then, David is joined by Timothy Naftali, the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, to discuss perhaps Trump’s most brazen grift: his proposed presidential library in Miami. Frum and Naftali also discuss why comparisons of Trump to Nixon fall flat and how Trump’s actions in Venezuela reflect a policy of weakness.

Finally, David ends the episode with a discussion of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum:  Hello, and welcome to this week’s episode of The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Tim Naftali. You may know Tim from his many appearances on CNN, where he talks about the history of the presidency. Tim is a distinguished historian of U.S. diplomacy during the Cold War. He was also the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, and we’ll be talking about the many strange moneymaking schemes around the plan for a [Donald] Trump presidential library in Miami. And we’ll be talking about the chaos and danger of the Trump foreign policy as it stumbles toward conflict with Europe over Greenland, in South America over Venezuela, in Iran, in the Far East.

My book this week will be Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë, and I’ll be talking about that and what it tells us about our changing attitudes toward children and toward cruelty.

But before the dialogue with Tim, before the book discussion of Jane Eyre, some preliminary thoughts about what we have seen in these remarkable early days of January 2026. It does seem that the MAGA movement and the Trump presidency have entered a kind of crazy death spiral. So many bizarre and menacing things have happened in just the past few days. There seems to be a kind of intensification of the crisis that has been with us since the beginning of the Trump era, the crisis that has been with us since the beginning of the Trump second term, and now, in 2026, a crisis that becomes ever more terrifying.

Over the weekend, there was a kind of rampage of ICE personnel in the city of Minneapolis. The weekend opened with the shooting death of a motorist in Minneapolis, Renee [Nicole] Good. And ICE seems to have reacted to the outburst of feeling about that shooting not by investigating the shooting, not by reconsidering its methods, but by using ever more brutal methods against ever more people in the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota.

ICE seems to be acting more and more not like a proper federal law-enforcement agency, with all the high professionalism and exacting standards that Americans rightfully expect and usually get from federal law enforcement. It’s acting like an armed MAGA militia, like the armed force of a political party, occupying part of the country and part of the voting population on behalf of another part of the country and another bloc of the voting population.

This comes as President Trump gave an interview to The New York Times in which he said that one of his great regrets about his first term was that he did not order the National Guard to seize voting machines in the election of 2020. Now, back then, there is some question whether, even if he’d issued such a shocking and illegal and improper order, whether the National Guard would have executed it, but now he has this armed mass of ICE militia roaming the country, breaking laws, ignoring rules. He seems to see them as his tool for carrying out such schemes in the year ahead.

At the same time, other bizarre behaviors have been issuing. On Sunday night, we learned that the Trump administration had opened a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell for obviously specious and fake grounds. The Federal Reserve is renovating its headquarters. It’s a big project. There’s some questions about how much the project should cost, as there often are in federal buildings. Some of the reason for the expense is because President Trump himself in his first term ordered marble and other fancy accoutrements. Jerome Powell has testified to Congress about the cost. It’s a very technical matter, and Donald Trump’s people have decided this is their chance to bring pressure to bear on Jerome Powell to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates faster to help Donald Trump avoid catastrophe in the elections of 2026.

Jerome Powell then released a video denouncing the politicization of the Federal Reserve, denouncing the politicization of the Department of Justice that would allow itself to be used in such a way. Powell was promptly backed by a Republican senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But we’re left with a real question: What happens to the Federal Reserve now? Jerome Powell’s term is set to expire in May of 2026. Will any Trump nominee be trusted by anybody as anything other than a Trump stooge? Can the Federal Reserve ever cut interest rates again without it looking like it’s yielding to intimidation by the Trump administration? We may, in fact, find ourselves with higher interest rates than we otherwise would have because of Trump’s attempt to abusively use improper process of law and his shamefully weak U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to intimidate the Federal Reserve Board into adopting different monetary policies than the ones that the Federal Reserve, in its collective opinion, collective judgment, thought were appropriate.

This seems part of a quickening spiral, but it’s not all. The president has been issuing other kinds of crazy commands and fatwas into the economy, decreeing with no legal authority that credit card rates be cut, talking about American oil companies that he’s trying to bully into crazy and unprofitable investments in Venezuela. Over the weekend, he issued a Truth Social post in which he described himself as the “Acting President of Venezuela,” which is kind of a spoof, but also a scene out of Woody Allen’s Bananas where the aging authoritarian president seems to be losing his marbles. He’s not the acting president of Venezuela. No American president should even joke about such a thing. But this one may not be joking.

And finally, we have the eruptions of more and more people around Trump to justify the killing of the motorist in Minneapolis—three bullets into the side of a car for someone who was, as we can all see, trying to escape a confrontation and who was set upon by an officer who seemed bent on punishing her not for anything she did wrong, but for her attitude toward him, for her disrespect toward him—a killing that seemed to have been motivated by ego, not by any sense of self-defense.

We’re in a kind of crack-up of the MAGA world. It’s becoming more extreme, more at variance with America, as it feels its unpopularity intensifying because of the terrible economy. We had a job report at the end of the week before I record that showed that the United States in all of 2025 created fewer net new jobs than the population of the city of Spokane, Washington. The economy’s in trouble, and prices are rising. The Republican prospects for 2026 are diminishing—at least if there is a free and fair election in 2026. And the president’s mind is going to: How can he seize voting machines? How can he use an armed militia against his political opponents? How can he use law enforcement, or the pretense of law enforcement, to pressure the Federal Reserve into making monetary policy subordinate to Trump’s reelection wishes? How can he steal oil from Venezuela? How can he steal Greenland from the Danes?

Trump’s MAGA movement is spiraling on a kind of death cycle. It’s taking the MAGA movement, the Trump presidency, the United States, and much of the rest of the world along for the downward ride to doom. Now, we are not helpless, as individuals, as citizens, to correct course, to stop this ride, to prevent MAGA from doing what it wants to do. We’re going to have to act responsibly because there is a stark choice here. MAGA is not America as we knew America, as we believe in America. MAGA is not the America where rights are respected; where police serve the public, and they don’t attack and harm the public. MAGA is not the America where the law is independent of the president and where the dollar is something that can be trusted by the whole world.

MAGA’s America is one thing; America’s America is another. You can have the rule of law in America, or you can have the Trump MAGA regime, not both. This is going to be, in 2026, the year for choosing. I am hopeful that Americans will, together, choose right. But I have to be clear-eyed about what the alternative is, how dangerous it is, and how bent it is on the doom of everything good and decent about the America as you used to know it.

And now my dialogue with Tim Naftali. But first, a quick break.

Frum: Timothy Naftali is a senior research scholar and adjunct professor at Columbia University School of International [and] Public Affairs. He previously served as the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. His many books include the 1997 classic “One Hell of a Gamble,” the definitive account of the Cuban missile crisis from the Soviet point of view. He is a regular contributor to CNN, where he is their in-house presidential historian. Tim is a native of Montreal, Canada. We were undergraduates together at Yale in the early 1980s and have been friends ever since, although I note for the record that Tim was several classes younger than me and is therefore considerably better preserved. (Laughs.) Tim, welcome so much to The David Frum [Show]. Thank you for making time today.

Timothy Naftali: So you begin with a lie. (Laughs.)

Frum: (Laughs.) No, no, you are an amazing specimen—intellectual, moral, and physical.

Frum: So we’ve got so many things to cover, but I wanna start drawing on your expertise as a founder of a presidential library. There is a project for a Trump presidential library in Miami. It will not surprise you to hear that this project is laden with scandal, but you think it’s not just the financial scandals that are important. So let’s talk about the financial scandal and the intellectual scandal of the Trump library.

Naftali: First of all, it’s great to be with you, David. I had the privilege of working for the National Archives and Records Administration, and I was appointed—I didn’t apply for the job, but I was appointed to be the first federal director of the Nixon Library. After Watergate, because of concerns that President Nixon would destroy his famous tapes and the documents, Congress seized his materials; President [Gerald] Ford signed the law, and so. And as a result, the Nixon materials couldn’t leave the Washington, D.C., area. So Nixon could not have a real presidential library, so he got an ersatz library. His family built a private Nixon Library—the museum was private. the archive was private—but it didn’t have any of his presidential materials, ’cause they couldn’t leave Washington, D.C.

Fast-forward about 10 years, for reasons that the Nixon family knows best, the Nixon family decided they didn’t wanna run this private library any longer; they wanted the federal government to run it. Well, for that to happen, they had to get Congress to change the governing law that affected the Nixon materials. Congress did change the law. The National Archives would then become responsible for the Nixon Library, would rename it, and would move the presidential materials from Washington, D.C., to Yorba Linda, California. And they needed a director for that, and they appointed me.

One of the challenges for my team was to establish the credibility of this new institution. Understandably, many Americans, not just those who are old enough to remember Watergate, were concerned about what might happen to the Nixon tapes and the Nixon papers if they were moved to Yorba Linda and perhaps, technically, under some kind of watchful eye of the Nixon family. And so it was really essential that the first federal director established the credibility of this space, that it’d be nonpartisan—not anti-Nixon, but not pro-Nixon. And so that was my job.

And among my responsibilities was to be the curator of the Watergate exhibit, the old Watergate exhibit. What we inherited basically made the argument that Watergate was a “coup” that happened in order to overturn the results of the 1972 election, and the Democrats pushed Nixon out, and that Nixon was mistreated. And given that we were moving to Yorba Linda, the documents, the materials that made clear that the president had been engaged in abuse of power—and he was never indicted, so we can’t say he was criminally responsible, but let’s say that there was heavy, heavy evidence that suggested the president had participated in criminal actions—in any case, how could you move those documents to Yorba Linda and then have in the public space up ahead, ’cause the archive was downstairs, material that contradicted the basic documents that we had? So the Watergate exhibit had to be changed. The Nixon Foundation said they couldn’t do it, and they asked me to do it, and the National Archives asked me to do it, so I was the curator of a Watergate exhibit, which was one way of establishing the credibility of the institution. And another way was to make sure a lot of materials were declassified and tapes were made available to the public, which we did. I was there for five years in total.

Frum: So let’s move forward in time from the Nixon Library, as you described it, to the project in the 2020s for a Trump presidential library. This library, as I read, is to be built in Miami on an extremely valuable piece of land, almost three acres big, on a highly developable strip of road where you could build condo towers or a hotel or something like that. The land formerly belonged to a local college. The land was transferred by the local college from the college’s ownership to the state government with no payment to the college, not the $65 million that is conservatively estimated, not the $100 million it might be worth, not more—nothing to the college. The state then transferred the land to a trust governed by representatives of the Trump family, and the idea is that some kind of Trump institution will be built on this parcel of land.

But there are a lot of hints that what will be built on the land is not just a library, as we’ve known it, not even the kind of crazy pharaonic library that you get for Barack Obama, but for-profit uses: condos, maybe a hotel. I’ve seen you quoted in stories about this project. What do you know about the coming Trump library? How does it compare and contrast to other presidential libraries that already exist?

Naftali: Well, I don’t know much more than what you’ve just described, David, but I believe in the idea of a presidential library, and I believe in the importance of nonpartisan public history. One of the things I learned out in Yorba Linda was that presidential libraries are important local institutions; we had a lot of students from local high schools and middle schools come to visit. Obviously, we had visitors from across the country. And we were able, in a sense, to try, as a team, to set a standard for public history.

So I believe in these institutions, and I am worried at the development, at the turn that these institutions have taken. You mentioned Barack Obama. President Obama had an opportunity to set a high standard for public history. We could debate his presidency, but what he did not have was a Watergate or an Iran-Contra. He did not have the sort of overwhelming scandal that allies of any president would have a hard time sort of softening, if not deleting entirely. So he had the opportunity to present, or to create, a model, a gem for public history, allowing the National Archives to do its job, overseeing a museum, but he didn’t do it. He decided that he wanted a private museum. Now, I’m not suggesting that Barack Obama wanted to re-create what we inherited and had to change in Yorba Linda, but it was clear that he wanted and his team wanted to be in control of how his presidency is portrayed.

Now we talk about Trump. Now, I’m not saying that President Trump would be doing what he’s doing now if Barack Obama had chosen to have a standard presidential library, but the fact that Barack Obama rejected the standard model of a presidential library just made it a little bit easier for President Trump to create what appears to be Trumpland. And I just think it’s disappointing. Our public institutions are under extreme stress; you’ve talked about this in your podcast on multiple occasions. And I think that, as a people, our self-confidence is directly proportional to how willing we are to talk about the peaks and valleys of our history. And one of the places where people can learn about the peaks and valleys of our history are these presidential libraries. And it’s sad that we’re gonna lose yet another opportunity to learn about the complexities of this era because the Trump library will be as disconnected from reality as possible.

You asked about corruption and Nixon. Before Watergate, Nixon put pressure on a House committee to give up federal land near San Clemente, which was actually part of Camp Pendleton, and allow him to use it for a library—so that’s public federal land, not state land. And Nixon’s people were putting pressure on getting that land. Of course, with Watergate, not only did that pressure campaign end, but the then-Nixon Foundation collapsed; the one that exists now was created well after Watergate. So the idea of putting pressure on a locality or on the federal government to get land that wasn’t really yours for a presidential library, that didn’t start with Trump. Nixon attempted to do it, but Watergate ended those particular desires.

Frum: But pre-Watergate Nixon, when he thought about, And we’ll have a for-profit use in this hypothetical Nixon Library; there will be a cafeteria, a gift shop, perhaps, he didn’t think, We’re gonna have a condo tower and hotel.

Naftali: No, of course not. That would have, by the way, obstructed the view from San Clemente. Of course, he didn’t wanna have … (Laughs.)

Naftali: Now, come on. Remember, Richard Nixon was a realist. No, no, no, of course not, but remember—let’s keep in mind that Donald Trump is our first developer president, and therefore, he thinks of everything in terms of development and, of course, self-enrichment, so I’m not surprised. Look, one of the things that’s clear about the Trump library is it’s gonna reflect the mores and the corruption of the era we’re living in, so it’ll be very representative of this period.

Frum: Yeah, I mean Nixon was a presidency who had a scandal, but Trump is a scandal who has a presidency. (Laughs.)

Frum: So with Nixon, there are a lot of—and I’ve seen this amazing and fascinating institution that has been developed there. There are different rooms because there are things you can say about Nixon that are not about Watergate: diplomatic overtures, maybe the single most important environmental record of any of the presidents, meeting and failing to overcome economic challenges, race relations, or crime. There are a series of Nixon stories that are separate from the Watergate scandal story. I don’t know if there’s any aspect of the Trump presidency, any, that isn’t touched by some really important story of self-enrichment or corrupt dealing or lawbreaking of some other kind. I don’t think there’s a one. There isn’t a room that is: Okay, this is the presidency apart from the scandal. And so, as you say, maybe it’s fitting that the whole library is itself kind of a scandal.

Naftali: Well, I think the first term had a few things that could be pointed to: Warp Speed. Of course, the Trump people don’t wanna talk about that; MAHA does not include vaccines. But I really—and this is a point of view that may seem old-fashioned now and naive—but I really believe that it is healthy for a country to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of our presidents, rather than seeing them as these totems or these saints that are perfect or are devils.

Nixon is complicated. One of the things about Nixon that people might find interesting is that he had a sense of shame. He had a sense of shame, and he had a sense of legitimacy. And his sense of legitimacy was his understanding of what the presidency should look like. And when he thought about the presidency, he was thinking about Dwight Eisenhower and he was thinking about Franklin Roosevelt. So that’s why he was so secretive. Yes, he had dark impulses, but he knew that the American people would not embrace them, and so he was not honest about them.

We live in a different period. We live in a period where we have a president who has been reelected despite the fact that he shared his dark impulses with the American people. And he is not constrained by shame. And Nixon had shame, so it meant internal constraint. And then he had guardrails. And of course, we all talk about them all the time, but his term—his time in office; he had a little more than one term—Richard Nixon had guardrails. And he would have been a worse president domestically had it not been for the guardrails. Well, we have now a president with similar, but not identical, dark impulses who has no sense of shame and no guardrails. And that’s why the Trump presidency, in its 2.0 version, cannot be compared to the Nixon presidency at all. The Trump first term could be compared because you had a president with dark impulses surrounded by good-government Republicans with guardrails. We’re in a different world now.

Frum: Yeah. Well, I think it needs to be stressed again and again with Richard Nixon that the president he most admired was the unlikely figure of Woodrow Wilson, who was the president that most voiced a kind of vaunting idealism, sometimes a little ethereal, out-of-this-world idealism, and Nixon admired that. Richard Nixon’s parents, especially his beloved mother, had been huge Wilsonians, and he admired him so much. There’s a story that William Safire tells—and I’ve never been able to find out whether Safire is wrong or right about the story, and we’ll just have to take it onto Safire’s testimony—but Richard Nixon, in his hideaway office in the Executive Office Building, had a desk that he pulled from the White House inventory—and you must know the story—that was described in the record as the “Wilson desk.” And he believed this was Woodrow Wilson’s desk, on which Woodrow Wilson typed his work. And Safire, who was a Nixon speechwriter, said he talked to the head of the whoever keeps these inventories, and he said, Look, it’s not the Woodrow Wilson desk; it’s the Henry Wilson desk, Henry Wilson being [Ulysses S.] Grant’s vice president.

Frum: But no one has the heart to tell the president that he’s got the wrong [Wilson]. (Laughs.) Now, again, I’ve not been able ever to confirm or deny this story, but Safire would be a pretty good authority; he was there.

Naftali: Well, one thing about Safire is he had a very nice metaphor for Nixon, which was that Nixon was a layer cake, and think of him as a layer cake, and you cut a slice and all these layers, and they’re different, and they’re somewhat contradictory.

One thing I wanna mention is that, yes, it’s true—Woodrow Wilson was a historical mentor of sorts—but so was de Gaulle. Richard Nixon admired [former French President] Charles de Gaulle, next to Eisenhower, of any living leader at the time. And of course, de Gaulle wasn’t Wilsonian at all. (Laughs.) He was the most Machiavellian of leaders. So Nixon’s a complicated man. The point, however—

Frum: But he was, in his own way, a man of great integrity and ethic who had refused to join the sellout of French national identity after the fall of France and had taken the enormous risk of going into exile with nothing, not even his family; they followed later. So that’s an inspirational example too, whereas Donald Trump’s example seemed to be Roy Cohn.

Naftali: Well, and one more thing: Again, Richard Nixon also understood the international system. He did not wanna destroy the architecture that [President Harry S.] Truman had constructed. Although he had real doubts about elements, of course, of the Great Society, he wasn’t about to dismantle the New Deal. He came from a poor family, and he recognized the importance of a safety net. He’s a complicated man.

One of the reasons we talk about him—not simply because he resigned, but he had these dark impulses, and he was a bigot, and he was an anti-Semite. And these dark passions motivated policy, at times, and so that’s why we talk about him: He was a flawed character. The difference, however, was he was a smart man, and he was a man who read, and he was a man who understood history, and he cared about history, and he did not wanna be an outlier. He was not someone who believed, I am the beginning and the end of American history. I have predecessors, and I have to be mindful of them, so that’s also a source of some constraint on his behavior.

Naftali: And I will be passing on to them a better country, I hope, than the one that I received. But remember, he was thinking in terms of the country. His self-dealing involved a $7,000—get this—a $7,000 shield around his pool in San Clemente. That was the great corrupt bargain of his presidency. Now, his crimes and his abuse of power are quite different, but when you talk about “What did he steal, if anything?,” what the Congress found was, yes, he found a way to get the Secret Service to say that it was in the interest of his protection that he have a screen around his pool.

Frum: By the way, that’s not a crazy claim.

Naftali: No, it’s not a crazy claim, but just to give you a sense of proportion.

Frum: It’s not a billion-dollar crypto scheme in which your investors lose 95 percent of their money. (Laughs.)

Naftali: No, no, no. No, he wasn’t a grifter. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon was not a grifter, and it’s important to keep that in mind.

Richard Nixon also believed in allies. He didn’t like all of them—he had some very choice things to say about [former Canadian Prime Minister] Pierre Trudeau and others—but he believed in alliances. He wasn’t about to disrupt and destroy what he had inherited, even though he differed from some of his predecessors. We live in an era with a president who is disrupting and destroying because he can.

Frum: Yeah. One of my pet peeves is: People will use the phrase about Trump “the most corrupt presidency in American history.” And to which I was saying, Okay, if you were to do the corrupt presidencies: Ulysses Grant, Warren Harding, who else would you—although, as you say, Watergate is not technically a corruption scandal, but let’s throw it in because we’re speaking loosely. Would you add anybody else to that list?

Naftali: Well, one of the problems for those of us who study this is that the documents are pretty sparse about congressional corruption in the 19th century; we have some documents about presidential corruption. But keep in mind, before Chester Arthur, ironically, pushes for civil service reform, and we get a nonpartisan professional civil service, government jobs were given away to the highest bidder. So, in a sense, you had a basic corruption at the core of presidencies because—

Frum: I wanna dissent for that. They were not sold to the highest bidder; they were given as rewards for party loyalty. So it wasn’t [that] there was a lot of cash that traded hands—because people who had cash to spend would not want a government job. They might want a government contract.

Naftali: I was thinking about being the head of the post office—or, actually—

Naftali: —the customs duty officer, or also, the person who had the concession on, in that era, the Indian land reservation, those people made lots of money. Also, that was the era when government documents were actually printed by private companies, and that particular contract was worth a lot of money. No, the president didn’t get any cash in return, but he was paying off an ally, and there was a business consequence for the ally.

Frum: And then you have Warren Harding, who himself was kind of a lecherous “slob,” as Alice Roosevelt [Longworth] called him, but doesn’t seem to have been on the take in any way—

Frum: The big corruption scandals were happening around him and with him being checked out and indifferent because he was not very intelligent and not very conscientious, but he was not, personally, a crook.

But the point I’m building to is that I don’t think you can compare any of these things to, for example, the Trump crypto business, where a president has made a billion dollars in less than a year in office selling assets that have just collapsed in [value] in the hands of the buyers. And this, to me, looks like that we need to say: This is not the most corrupt president in American history. If Trump were Russian, if Trump were Nigerian, he’d be one of the contenders for the most corrupt president in Nigerian or Russian history. He’s just outside the realm of anything ever previously contemplated for a president—not for an Indian lands commissioner, not for the head of the New York [Custom] House, but for a president in American history.

Naftali: If you look at the essence of all of these peace discussions, it is no surprise that sovereign-wealth funds are involved because we—not the American people, but we, our government—is seeking resources. So it’s not a peace agreement. What is happening is that we are engaging in some kind of bribery scandal with all these countries, where we are saying, Give us a piece of whatever your mineral resources might be—like in Congo, there are certain kinds, and in Ukraine—and we’re saying, We’ll help you by throwing our weight around, but in return, you’re gonna help us. And us is not the American people writ large, but the president’s—I would call them the chauvinistas or chovinistas, of Mar-a-Lago, the people that are close to the Trump family. They’re the ones likely—and the tech bros—they’re the ones likely to benefit from this.

This is, to use the term from Broadway, this is a musical crap game that is going from conflict zone to conflict zone, and the president is using this as a way to enrich himself and his allies. There is no precedent for this. And because there is no country as powerful as the United States, no authoritarian leader in the world has the opportunities for enrichment that Donald Trump has at the moment.

Frum: Well, this takes us, I think, to the Venezuela topic, which you wanted to discuss. Now, one of the things I have said, and I’ve said this in a more colloquial way that was open to be misunderstood, that I talked about wars for oil and how no one fights them. Well, that’s not quite right; people have fought wars for oil. But what I mean is that anyone who did his accounting wouldn’t do a fight for oil because the oil is available on the marketplace. You have to pay for it. Whether or not the oil is on land that is friendly to you or not, whether it’s your sovereign territory or not, you have to pay for the technology; you have the return on capital; you have to pay the people who work there; you have to build the infrastructure and the roads. If you do proper accounting, what you’ll [find is]: You know what, just buy it; don’t fight for it. The war costs way more than any benefit of the oil. But of course, if you don’t do the accounting, if you say, Well, no, my accounting is this: The public pays all the bills, and a small handful of insiders get all the benefits. Then, from the point of view of that small handful of insiders, then the war can make sense, which is what seems to be happening in Venezuela.

Americans of a certain age forget this: The United States is now again by far the largest producer of oil on Earth and by far the largest producer of natural gas on Earth. If you throw in Canada—and Trump wants to not throw in but grab Canada, but group the United States and Canada together, whether Canada retains its independence or not—almost 30 percent of the planet’s output of oil comes from the United States and Canada. And the price is at barely breakeven right now, so it’s not like we’re desperately short of it. As I record, it’s about $58 a barrel, and in most parts of North America, that’s a break-even price. So the idea of having lots more of it—for what? But there are people who say, If I can get my personal hands on Venezuelan oil, at someone else’s expense, then I personally can make a lot of money, even though it’s a crazy-bad deal for the American people.

Naftali: One of the things that students of the Cold War—some—missed was that we did not engage in our Cold War crusades in search of resources. In fact, the quagmire area was Vietnam, and there were, at the time, no resources whatsoever. We were in the business of regime change and regime construction because we were contesting the world with the Soviet Union, and we were also worried about the credibility of our alliances. When we were dragged into some countries, we were dragged in because of the weakness of our allies, and Iran is a perfect example. We toppled the government of Iran because the British had been pressing us to do this. Why—

Naftali: The 1950s. I’m bringing this up because what our president is doing now is what weak countries do, not strong countries. The British were weak, and they needed to control the oil refinery in Abadan, in Iran, and they did not want the Iranians to have a better share of the money that was really theirs. And so the British put pressure on us to help them. And we knew how weak the British were.

So it’s absolutely true that the mercantilist Trump vision of how states are powerful is a vision of a weak country, not a strong one. We have the resources to buy what we need. But I agree: What I think is going on is that his buddies are going to benefit, which is why he is dealing with the Congo and why he’s—I’m not sure what he’s getting from Thailand and Cambodia, but that’s why he’s interested in the Congo; that’s why he’s interested in Azerbaijan, and he called it Albania, but it’s Armenia. It’s because these places have resources, and he and his buddies would like access to it. It has nothing to do with the interests of the United States.

Frum: Yeah, it’s a private profit at public expense. And I think you are putting your finger on something very profound, which is: During the Cold War, at the time of American power, the American interest was always a world system. That’s why the United States from 1945 onward, and even before, rejected spheres of influence, because spheres of influence were for losers. The American view was, Sphere of influence? It’s the planet. We can’t necessarily make our writ run on every part of the planet all the time; there are other powers, some of them hostile. But our vision is of a planetary-wide system of collective security, free trade, American investment—we want the whole thing. And we believe that will be good for people; we believe that we’re bringing liberty and prosperity to other people, so it’s not something we’re cruelly imposing on others. But the ambition was large.

The sphere of influence is what declining powers want: Well, as we no longer can make our writ run broader and broader, so we want an area where we’re preserved and where other powers agree not to poach in our waters, because they could if there weren’t a deal. You’re going to talk about the Monroe Doctrine a little bit—

Frum:  The Monroe Doctrine was issued in the United States—I think you were going to say “was weak,” and so explain that.

Naftali: Well, the Monroe Doctrine—1823, the Spanish empire is collapsing in the Americas. There’s a great fear that the French and the Russians, what was called then the Holy Alliance, would come in, sweep back into the Western Hemisphere, and reimpose monarchical systems, in competition with our Republican system. And so the U.S. government wanted to say to the European monarchical powers, Stay away. We will be neutral in your conflicts in your sphere. Stay away from the Western Hemisphere. It was an anti-European doctrine. What happens over time is, as American power grows, the Monroe Doctrine becomes a more offensive doctrine.

Frum: I gotta pause you there, though, because this is a thing that I think not enough Americans realize when we talk about spheres of influence being for the weak. What was the enforcement mechanism for the Monroe Doctrine?

Naftali: Oh, it’s easy: the British navy. The British navy—  Frum: It was the British navy. (Laughs.) It was the British navy! The way the Monroe Doctrine worked was: The United States said to Britain, We will offer you privileged access, or favorable access, to our markets, which were—we fought two wars, the Revolution and 1812; there’s a lot of unpleasantness and ill feeling. Let’s put all of that behind us. Let us be permanent friends. (Laughs.) And your navy, which you pay for, will police the Arctic to keep the Spanish and everybody else out of what we are calling our hemisphere, but what we really mean is your hemisphere.

Naftali: Look, we could, and I don’t know if your listeners would wanna do this, but we could talk about the peculiar relationship between the Americans and the British. The British actually offered to have a joint statement that was something like the Monroe Doctrine; they actually offered it to the Monroe administration. And John Quincy Adams, who wanted to be president in 1824, realized—he was secretary of state at the time—realized that, because his father was John Adams and associated with the Federalists, which were associated with a pro-British party, that it would be political suicide if he participated in a joint statement with London. So he convinced Monroe, No, no, no, no joint statement with London. Let’s have a unilateral statement that says, “Europe out.” But the administration actually knew that it needed Britain; it desperately needed Britain. Even Thomas Jefferson, who was a former president by that point, and Jefferson never liked the British much, recognized that Britain could destroy the United States and wanted—this is as a former president—wanted the Monroe administration to be on good terms with Britain, so absolutely, the Monroe Doctrine was a product of weakness, not strength. It’s in the 20th century that, with the growth in American power, the Monroe Doctrine is pointed to as a source of strength. It wasn’t. That’s not its tradition.

Frum: And then, in the early 20th century, the United States has become strong, but is not yet the strongest. Then the United States becomes increasingly aggressive and militaristic in its enforcement of an exclusion zone, especially in the Caribbean—principally against the Germans, much less against the British, who still were a fearsome force in the 1890s, 1910s.

Naftali: Well, I’m gonna say something nice about lawyers. I don’t often say nice things about lawyers, American lawyers, but I wanna say this about American lawyers. So you have Theodore Roosevelt, who, because he desperately wants the [Panama] Canal, right, Theodore Roosevelt has something called the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which basically says the United States can intervene at will in its sphere of influence, which is the Western Hemisphere, to protect American interests and American private interests. In the 1930s, American lawyers, Elihu Root and Henry Stimson, say, This is a bad policy. We don’t wanna be intervening. The United States, for example, had Marines in Nicaragua from 1912 to 1931. It was almost as long as we had troops in Afghanistan.

Naftali: And the position was: It’s foolish. These are expensive investments. And frankly, we don’t wanna be running these countries, because then we have to be involved in the day-to-day business of their politics, which are confusing. And anyway, they speak Spanish; Haiti speaks French. So what Stimson, who was secretary of state under Herbert Hoover, says is, We’re not doing this anymore. The Monroe Doctrine, it’s a doctrine of the United States versus Europe, not the United States versus Latin America. This is not in our interests. We are no longer gonna do this.

And so from 1931 until last weekend, our position in the Western Hemisphere was: We have an interest in an American system of free states. Different presidents had a different threshold for intervention, but the fact of the matter is, ultimately, what we want are all these states to govern themselves and for us to trade with them. It was not, We wanna find the resources we need and acquire them. That had been our policy before 1931. It hasn’t been since 1931, and now it has changed, and I sure wish the team in power did a little bit of historical work and realized why we got out of that business back in the early 20th century.

Frum: Well, they’re about to find out the hard way because, this intervention in Venezuela—maybe they’ve just bundled President [Nicolás] Maduro out of town, and they’re going to give him a trial and see what happens. I keep saying they have not calculated enough that he might be acquitted. You gotta think that there is a real chance that that could happen because it’s not a drumhead court-martial. It’s not a Pete Hegseth I take away your pension, and then you sue me. It’s going to be a real trial, and the defendant can win. And, by the way, and if the defendant wins, the defendant may have some tort claims (Laughs.) against the United States for the summary method with which he was removed, so that could all happen. They didn’t seem to have thought about that.

But if they are serious about trying to extract oil from Venezuela, the oil is in places where the road network isn’t good, where the electrical network isn’t good. I’m given to understand there are not remotely enough tankers in the world to begin moving Venezuelan oil at any scale. So all of those things are going to have to be built and paid for by somebody.

Naftali: Yes, and ask yourself, with the price of oil dropping—and you’re in the oil business—are you going to invest money into what could be a failed state? So then the question is, Okay, well, we—

Frum: With guerilla warfare a real possibility.

Naftali: Yeah. So then we ask the question, Oh, well, we don’t want a failed state. Oh, no, no, no, we don’t want a Somalia. No, no, no, no, no. And then the question is, Okay, how are you going to avoid a failed state with this particular approach to the transition in Venezuela? You’ve got a group of people whose intellectual worldview is fundamentally different from our—I don’t care how Machiavellian they might be; they are fundamentally different from the vision that the best of the Trump team has for Venezuela, by that, I mean Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio. How are you gonna manage that with them? Well, maybe you can’t manage it with them, which means we have to go, which means we find ourselves supervising the police, making sure there’s law and order, because no American businessperson is gonna wanna invest in Somalia or you name whichever failed country that might have access to oil—you name it, and they’re not gonna wanna do it—which means we’ve just managed to create a failed state in Venezuela, or at least, that’s the possibility.

It’s amazing to me the hubris that has led to this. But, by the way, as we’ve seen before, hubris begets hubris because we’re already talking about the next great American expedition and acquisition in the Western Hemisphere: Greenland.

Do you think the Trump library in Miami will, in fact, ever be built?

Naftali: Hmm. Well, after the first term, of course, the current president decided he hadn’t lost and his interest was in regaining power, not in legacy. And so there was no Trump library—there was no foundation for a Trump library after the first term. There seems to be some interest in legacy right now. After all, this is a president who wants his name on everything, so he’s clearly thinking about the future. It’s fascinating. He’s already putting his name everywhere, as if he’s about to retire. So I have a feeling that the old man actually wants a Trump library.

Frum: Let me develop the thought a little bit. He’s tapping out hundreds of millions of dollars for this Trump ballroom that is being built beside the White House. The estimate began at $200-something million. It’s risen to $300 million. I don’t know that there’s any real cost accounting going on here; I would not be surprised if it turns out to be a lot more than that. He won’t care, because he’s raising the money from people who are buying influence. They don’t care: Well, what does it cost to keep Trump happy? Twenty-five million dollars. I give it; I get something in return.

But a lot of those people are going to be tapped out. He’s not going to want to pay for the Trump library himself. He’s going to wanna turn to that same network of donors. And their calculus of interest in paying for it may be quite different after November than it is now. They’re not giving it because they like them so much; they’re giving it because they expect something from him. And that library advances to the extent that Trump can deliver benefits to people of whom he’s asking tens of millions of dollars.

Naftali: Well, we have to ask ourselves, To what extent will the government of Congo, will Qatar, will the UAE, will Saudi Arabia, to what extent are they gonna front-load payments to this library as part of elaborate agreements that the Trump team is engaged in? I wouldn’t be surprised if there are promissory notes for all these things that have already been established, and that would allow the Trump library to be sort of a laundering mechanism for whatever follows. So I wouldn’t put it past this team—I’m talking about the Trump team—that they are not thinking about ways to use this quasi-commercial Trump library as a place to park money, and money that we can get from governments that have an interest in what we’re deciding today, get it from them now. So they’re not gonna wait until December of 2028 to get this money.

Frum: Tim, thank you so much for your time and insight today.

Naftali: My pleasure. Thank you, David, for inviting me on.

Frum:  Thanks so much to Tim Naftali for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë. I opened this book series by discussing the masterwork by her sister Emily, Wuthering Heights, one of the darkest novels in the entire canon of English literature. Jane Eyre is a more assimilable document. It is much more like a classic love story, although very dark in its way. The story of Jane and her brooding, mysterious Mr. Rochester has, I think, enlivened a lot of high-school classes. I wanna discuss something that is not the love story, something that occurs earlier in the book Jane Eyre.

Jane Eyre tells autobiographically, in the first person, the story of a young English woman, starting from about the age of 10 until she is married and has children. The young Jane Eyre is an orphan who is sent to live with an aunt by marriage and cousins, who treat her neglectfully at best, quite brutally at worst. And the book opens with a searing depiction of the maltreatment and unkindness of the adult world to unwanted children. So here is a passage from the recollections of the young Jane Eyre, aged only 10. The aunt by marriage is named Mrs. Reed, and Mrs. Reed is the person referred to in the quote I’m about to read.

“Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.” The above is a quoted insult to the young Jane. “Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?

“‘Nothing, indeed,’ thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.”

Now, those are not a 10-year-old’s words. That’s not a 10-year-old’s vocabulary. But those are very much a 10-year-old’s feelings. And what I draw attention to here is this book, published in 1847, is the beginning of a new thing in English literature specifically and in world literature in general, which is attention to the vulnerability and feelings of the young child.

Now, it’s not invented in Jane Eyre. Oliver Twist is published in 1838, earlier, and I’m not scholar enough to know, but I’m sure somebody in English literature was doing this even before [Charles] Dickens and Charlotte Brontë. But it is something you will not find much of in the literature before 1800; nothing at all, I would think, before 1750; and nothing at all in Greek and Roman literature, and the other literatures that shaped English literature of the 19th century. It’s a new thought that is forming; a revolution against cruelty to the vulnerable, especially the young; a transformation in human consciousness expressed through literature and taught through literature.

Where does it come from, and what does it mean, this new thing in the world? Well, it comes from, in some ways, from a sort of secularized Protestant Christianity that a lot of the—Jane Eyre is a very religious person, and it’s a very religious book. Although the Brontës had not much use for the formally constituted clergy, the awareness of God and the person’s relationship to God is a powerful theme, especially in Jane Eyre, but in all the Brontë novels. It comes too, I think, from something that is happening in the material world around them. The 1840s are the beginnings of the moment where individual people in England would feel the power of the Industrial Revolution to transform humanity’s relationship to its environment.

When young Jane Eyre is sent off to school, there’s an outbreak of some kind of disease—maybe tuberculosis, maybe typhoid fever—that kills a lot of the girls. Now, Jane Eyre is written before the advent of modern germ theory. Neither the narrator nor the author understand where this disease comes from. But they do have a sense that something could and should be done about it, which is a new idea. As people become more masterful toward nature, they become more insistent that something better than what existed before could and should happen. And the way you measure this change, this transformation is, above all, in the status of the most vulnerable people in society and especially children. A revolution against cruelty, and you can see it happening in the pages of novels, and you can see it happening, especially, in the early parts of Jane Eyre.

It’s a remarkable thing to see a new idea coming into being, especially such a sweet and generous new idea as that of goodness and protectiveness toward children of every status, not just those who are children of kings, not just those who are heroes and gods, but every child. That’s the message of Jane Eyre. That’s a new idea in the world, and it’s one that we’re still integrating into our consciousness, but that has more and more power to shape and guide us, and should have more and more power to shape and guide us. The rejection of cruelty is one of the proudest things about modern humanity, and it’s good to meet it at the beginning of its career and to speed it along its way at this later phase in its career.

This seems to be a fairly standard case of corruption, caught the usual way.  Amount is peanuts compared to many, and like usual, the question of how they thought they&#39;d get away with it comes up.Taking away his federal pension will easily recoup the lost funds.

Agreed. Also, how is this news for nerds? Ordering phones and selling some to a pawn shop - OOO000ooo 1337 H4x0r!(yeah yeah... &quot;sysadmin&quot; and &quot;IT&quot; was in the blurb)

The government says it remains committed to mandatory digital right-to-work checks but will no longer require enrollment in a new ID system.
TL;DR: They found a way to get what they want from the existing paperwork.

That means the new ID system isn&#39;t required, can be &quot;sacrificed&quot; to appease the public, and hopefully distract the public long enough to enact their overall goals in spite of the public.

TL;DR: They found a way to get what they want from the existing paperwork.

Labour have wanted a national ID card for years. Most of our neighbouring countries have them, but there&#39;s some part of the British psyche that hears &quot;ID card&quot;, thinks &quot;papers please&quot; and then replies &quot;no fucking way&quot;. I don&#39;t really see much of a problem myself since we&#39;re not legally obliged to identify ourselves to police anyway, unless they suspect you of a crime. On the other hand I can foresee this government or a future one changing that if a national ID scheme existed. I think I&#39;d rather carry on wi

The ID checks are already decently strict. Any reputable employer demands a passport or equivalent and will check it.

Cunty non-employers like deliveroo pay sub minimum wage specifically on the principle that one account can be shared between people and they have no idea who it is so they are really contractors not employees and Deliveroo is basically exempt from everything.

And cash under-the-table people already know what they are doing and are likely also doing tax fraud and don&#39;t care either.

I personally think that a honest admission of having made a mistake and a frank acceptance of blame is a far greater show of strength than pushing through an idea everyone knows is stupid but too craven to say it out loud.Captain Asoh is a role model for me in this regard.

They can&#39;t help but show weakness or indecision.

It&#39;s not so much weakness and indecision as directionless.

Starmer has no apparent politics. No principles and no ideals.

So it&#39;s not weakness so much as a lack of direction. He has no particular idea why he&#39;s doing anything. Even his vague claims of &quot;working people&quot; and &quot;making things better&quot; don&#39;t hold up because you have to define what &quot;better&quot; is, for whom (who is a working person and why), what it looks like to be better, and so on. That ultimately requires

This is NOT a U-turn. They are backing off, for the moment. When they think no one is looking they will stomp on the gas again.

They won&#39;t give up. The answer is to vote them out of office.

It is already the case - and has been for ages - that you have to prove that you have the right to work in the UK before you can start a job by producing various paper documents.  However, there are also huge numbers of people working who don&#39;t have that right.  Ergo, unscrupulous employers don&#39;t do the required checks because then they can pay the illegal workers less and not bother with tedious things like taxes and workplace safety.

Nobody (not least from the government) ever explained how this &quot;digital ID&quot; would make any difference.  The dodgy employers simply wouldn&#39;t bother to check that either!

            <div id="article-text">SOoooooooo many companies have done the EXACT same thing.  This is a very tired playbook.  Usually results in little to no real effective improvement, but the metrics and dashboards look good to upper management, and the consultants doing the implementation are well paid.

It&#39;s just re-arranging chairs in a big organization.  Hardly newsworthy in my opinion.

Around the time they bought EMC to buy Documentum. It was a resounding failure. They tried again a few years later, and also had the same level of failure. This time, well, don&#39;t really care now that they made the partner program worthless. Fuck&#39;em. We&#39;re selling HPe now.

Or was Catalyst the replacement for the one that failed?

As I recall, the failed one customized everything for how EMC did things.  The replacement changed how EMC did things to match the default, as it was easier to change the company than customizes the software.  The only pain point I remember on the engineering side was all the part numbers changing to match the new standardized format.

&quot;The initiative, dubbed One Dell Way, will replace Dell&#39;s existing sprawl of applications, servers and databases with a single enterprise platform designed to unify the 42-year-old company&#39;s operations.&quot;

I could be wrong but I predict this will be a huge, costly, multi-year disaster that will cripple the company in new and exciting ways.

Maybe they built it in-house - there&#39;s a chance then. Or if they went to SAP or the likes, they better have had customized their processes to the ERP, not the other way round, because that would be the shortcut to clusterfuck and a bottomless pit to throw money in without ever getting out of pre-alpha.

Or, considering the times we are in, maybe they had someone vibe code everything with an AI backend. That would be fun to watch.

My previous employer was moving from Uniface on VAX/mainframes to the GUI version 7 when I began there in 1998 as sysadmin. The software team has been migrating to various newer ERP frameworks every few years since then and the German high command has decided last time to migrate all companies to SAP.

My best mate only has a couple more years to go before early retirment and has declined to join the SAP knowledge course. He&#39;s busy enough as one of the very few people who can service the sti

So ChatGTP told him that this was a good idea?

Cool! From what I hear, their divesting all of their hardware and software interests and concentrating solely on supplying best quality, high grade Baba Ganoush to the market. Can&#39;t wait!

I certainly understand the motive, but it&#39;s much easier to introduce a new single unifying platform than it is to migrate off and retire the myriad old ones.

So says the Dell guy: We need one way -- simplified, standardized and automated -- so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better

After a long career, all I can say is it is less important than you might think.

Let’s see where they are in a few years and whether it was worth it.

My guess: lots of heat and light, lots of short term chaos, followed finally by stabilization, followed by the realization they are only marginally more productive.

But middle management will be able to check off so many performance goals!

They re-wrote the social security systems in 30 days, didn’t they?  Or maybe it was the US air traffic control system. I can’t remember. Well, whatever it was, I hear they are wicked smaaaht and specialize in things like this.

&quot;Michael Dell, you blockhead!&quot; sneered COB Lucy as she held up the football.

Dell has made lots of acquisitions over the years, and each one had their own systems.  Dell acquired me at one point (I&#39;m sure that was their intent, and they just got EMC thrown in with the deal), so I&#39;ve certainly seen this.  It took a long time to really merge the companies, and I&#39;m sure they still have many separate systems.  Eventually it makes sense to move everything to the same enterprise management system; at least everything that they aren&#39;t keeping separate for an easy future spinoff.

My condolences and heartfelt sympathy for Dell employees about to undergo what must be the 300th failure to try to do this thing in the past 20 years. You will singularly bear the brunt of the pain, you will endure insane new meetings that will go nowhere and do nothing, and the result will be yet another new, mediocre thing to deal with.

It&#39;s a bold strategy, Cotton.  Let&#39;s see if it pays off for them.

Musk is a &quot;Quit bitching and do something to fix it&quot; type of person.

AGW proponents are in it for the bitching. Which is why the geoengineering climate solutions are met with &quot;Noooooo!&quot;

Why doesn’t the world’s richest man step up?

Step up to what? He&#39;s already building one of the most successful EV brands in the world. Basically changing the image of the vehicle from a glorified golf cart to a viable competitor for ICE. I think he&#39;s earned the right to tell everyone with their filthy little hands out to &quot;F-k off.&quot;

He&#39;s not a denier but he&#39;s definitely not talking about it or acknowledging it and as the OP mentioned he&#39;s a prominent enabler of the current administration that denies it so you know, his personal opinion and business ventures on the matter is somewhat irrelevant. Not that he should enforce opinions on the platform but what do we think much of the user base on X thinks about climate change?

10 years ago I&#39;d put Musk squarely in the helping camp, now, on the net, even with Tesla and all it does he&#39;s probably a net negative on the effort. if you believe it&#39;s a problem.  2012 Musk and 2026 Musk may as well be two different people.

> He&#39;s the same guy who says we need to have more people.

Do you really think Musk is a climate denier? 





He&#39;s the same guy who says we need to have more people.




Remind me again who is creating man made climate change.This is where the business mind of Musk clashes with the do-gooder appearances he used to try to keep up when he was pretending he was trying to save humanity. The business world desperately needs more humans to keep up the whole &quot;everything must grow forever&quot; thing that keeps the profit cycle churning. That&#39;s diametrically opposed to helping sustainability, which used to be something he prattled on about in between sci-fi sounding diatribes about making us multi-planetary in order to prevent the &quot;all eggs

From https://earthbound.report/2024... [earthbound.report]

Here&#39;s Elon Musk in 2006:&quot;The overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.&quot;

And in 2024:&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to sort of vilify the oil and gas industry ... I think we should just generally lean in the direction of sustainability.&quot;

In 2015:&quot;The goal is to exit the fossil fuel era as quickly as possible.&quot;

In 2024:&quot;If, I don&#39;t know, 50 to 100 years from now, we&#39;re mostly sustainable. I think that&#39;ll probably be okay. So it&#39;s not like the house is on fire immediately.&quot;

Here&#39;s Musk in 2015:&quot;If we wait, and if we delay the change, the best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy. The worst case however, is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined.&quot;

And in 2024:&quot;The risk is not as high as a lot of people say it is with respect to global warming. But I think if you just keep increasing the parts per million in the atmosphere long enough, eventually it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe. People don&#39;t realize this. If you go past a thousand parts per million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea.&quot;

Yes, that&#39;s Elon Musk telling Donald Trump that the biggest issue with carbon emissions is that people get headaches if you get to a thousand ppm of CO2.

Humanity is definitely in the &#39;stupid&#39; phase of it&#39;s existence.

Musk is a murderous sociopath. Someone needs to update the old Mexican beer commercial. Any AI animators in the house? Suggested script along these lines:

Goodreads was the specific website I was referring to in my reference to &quot;another sociopath&quot;. Since 2012 or thereabouts.

Well, that is a pretty daunting problem if the atmospheres natural CO2 levels are objectively toxic for humans. We&#39;d likely die out within a decade or two. I don&#39;t know how you can be more clear about us reaching 1000ppm of CO2.

As for man-made CO2: Musk has been consistent with his warnings. He says it&#39;s not doomsday yet, but there will be serious problems

What makes you think they don&#39;t publish methods?

You&#39;re a man of science so I&#39;ll get you started.

https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gis... [nasa.gov]

https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.... [wiley.com]

https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov... [nasa.gov]

Huh? All of the groups tracking global climate publish their methods in exhaustive details, with detailed discussion about precision and accuracy, and listing where the data comes from. Have you ever actually looked?  No, didn&#39;t think so.

Since we&#39;re discussing NASA here, try looking at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies page  [nasa.gov] and drilling down to Earth Observations/Temperature. But you could look at any of the other four major climate groups and find equivalent discussion of methods.

&quot;Yes, we&#39;re seeing a trend of global weather patterns altering for worse outcomes.

One tip-off for a cult is that they use their own language.

The good thing is that it seems to be the same language used in the Voynich Manuscript, so hopefully they will be able to decipher it. The problem is, we won&#39;t be able to understand them when they do.

These are the words of the first 16 scientists of 46 that have left the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) due to the corruption of science within the organisation ...

When we had our last set of quakes here in Humboldt we lost VZ coverage in my town because the cell tower had inadequate backup power. Verizon promised to bring a generator out and then... didn&#39;t. Had no phone service for three days.

I&#39;d get something else but it&#39;s all shit here. ATT? Fuck that. US Cellular? I know from experience trying to call people that they will regularly just tell callers to go fuck themselves instead of allowing them to leave you a voicemail. T-Mobile has 0 towers here.

Yeah, VZW has been sucking ass for a while now.  My main carrier is Tmo, which has a pretty solid buildout in my home areas, but I have VZW as backup for when I travel.

Lately, one of the main areas in which I use VZW has been seeing dialup-modem-level performance, and as an added bonus, MMS quit working entirely on their network.  They tell me to check the APNs, which doesn&#39;t work because Verizon demanded that Google lock users out of APN settings.  I got it to work for a while by manually editing settings

Sometimes you may need to back to using a classic landline where the CO has both batteries and generators capable of extended service times.But we can&#39;t watch TikToks of bitches twerking on a landline.

&quot;Sometimes you may need to back to using a classic landline&quot; ... Which the telcos are working to abandon as much as possible.

Anyway there weren&#39;t a bunch of other things going on at the same time and Verizon has money and can afford to rent a generator. More importantly, they lied.

They&#39;ll apologize and give you 5 dollars for your trouble

Or since that includes 911, perhaps your next of kin.

And then I remembered we switched away from Verizon late last year.  It just took a couple seconds to realize it.  I had gotten so used to dealing with the Verizon network being down.  One time it was down so long that I bought a mint mobile SIM to get connected.

When the Supreme Court heard arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J. on Tuesday, it confronted two cases that appear, at first glance, to raise the same question. Both involve state laws that bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ school sports teams. Both feature plaintiffs who argue that these laws violate the Constitution and, in the West Virginia case, Title IX. And both arrive at the court after lower courts treated transgender status as legally relevant to a discrimination inquiry. At oral argument, the justices did not approach the cases as moral disputes about inclusion or fairness in women’s sports. The questions largely avoided normative judgments altogether, focusing instead more narrowly on doctrine, statutory structure, and the limits of judicial review. That approach could produce a formally narrow decision that nevertheless risks foreclosing meaningful relief for transgender individuals whose discrimination claims would otherwise warrant serious judicial consideration.

Hecox arises from Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, enacted in 2020. The statute categorically bars transgender women and girls from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams at any level, from elementary school through college. Before the law’s enactment, Idaho permitted transgender girls to compete on girls’ teams under policies that required hormone suppression. Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman and college student, challenged the law after it foreclosed her ability to compete on women’s teams consistent with her gender identity. The district court preliminarily blocked enforcement of the law as applied to Hecox, concluding that she was likely to succeed on her equal protection claims. The 9th Circuit affirmed, holding that the law classified on the basis of sex and transgender status and failed heightened scrutiny because it rested on overbroad generalizations rather than evidence tailored to Hecox’s circumstances.

Idaho sought review, presenting the court with two threshold issues and one merits question. The first was mootness. Idaho argued that because Hecox is no longer competing under the law, the case no longer presents a live controversy. The second was the standard of review. Idaho insisted that the law does not classify based on transgender status and should be reviewed, at most, under the lower threshold of rational basis scrutiny. And even if intermediate scrutiny applies, the state argued, the law substantially advances its interest in protecting athletic opportunities for female athletes.

B.P.J. reaches the court from a different posture. West Virginia enacted a similar sports ban, which B.P.J., a transgender middle school student, challenged under both the equal protection clause and Title IX. Unlike Hecox, B.P.J. never experienced endogenous male puberty. The district court nevertheless granted summary judgment to the state. The 4th Circuit reversed. It held that excluding transgender girls from girls’ teams constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX, and that the law could not be justified as applied to B.P.J. because it effectively excluded her from meaningful participation in school athletics. On the equal protection claim, the 4th Circuit vacated summary judgment and remanded for further factual development, concluding that disputed questions remained about whether transgender girls like B.P.J. possess any meaningful athletic advantage over cisgender girls.

West Virginia asked the Supreme Court to reverse on both grounds. It argued that Title IX permits sex-separated athletics and does not require schools to treat transgender girls as similarly situated to cisgender girls. It also argued that the 4th Circuit erred by forcing the state to justify the law as applied to B.P.J. rather than assessing the validity of the sex classification in general.

Against that background, the states in both cases framed the dispute at Tuesday’s oral arguments as one about categorical sex distinctions, not transgender status. They emphasized that the challenged laws exclude all biological males from girls’ teams. The laws, they claim, do not draw lines based on gender identity. Any disparate effect on transgender girls, the states argued, is incidental rather than structural. This framing allowed the states to argue that the plaintiffs are not challenging a discriminatory law in the traditional sense. They are asking for individualized exceptions to a rule the law already tolerates.

Several justices appeared interested in that distinction. Chief Justice John Roberts pressed counsel on whether a sex-based classification in sports necessarily classifies based on transgender status. The implication was clear. If sex separation in sports is permissible, and if the law applies uniformly to all males and females, then the plaintiff’s claim is not that she is treated worse because of who she is, but that the general rule fails to account for her particular circumstances.

That move had important doctrinal consequences. Under equal protection law, intermediate scrutiny does not require perfect tailoring. The government may rely on generalizations so long as they are substantially related to an important interest. Idaho leaned heavily on that principle. It warned that allowing plaintiffs to prevail by showing that a justification does not fit them individually would transform intermediate scrutiny into something closer to strict scrutiny, forcing courts to adjudicate exceptions athlete by athlete. The federal government echoed that concern, cautioning that such an approach would undermine administrability and destabilize sex-separated sports.

The justices sympathetic to that argument returned repeatedly to the problem of line drawing. Sports, they suggested, require clear and enforceable rules. A regime that turns on individualized physiological assessments risks becoming unworkable. From that perspective, the relevant question is not whether the state can justify excluding this plaintiff, but whether the sex classification itself is substantially related to the state’s interest in protecting women’s sports.

The plaintiffs advanced a different conception of heightened scrutiny. They did not dispute that sex-separated sports are generally permissible. Instead, they argued that intermediate scrutiny requires courts to examine fit, not just at the level of abstraction but as applied to real people. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed this point forcefully. Even if a general rule is valid, she suggested, a plaintiff should be able to show that the rationale for the rule does not hold in her circumstances.

Justice Elena Kagan raised a related concern. She questioned whether the states’ theory effectively eliminates as-applied equal protection challenges in this context. If courts may never ask whether a sex-based rule actually advances the state’s interest for a particular plaintiff, then intermediate scrutiny loses much of its teeth.

Those disagreements came into sharper relief in B.P.J., where Title IX complicates the analysis. West Virginia relied heavily on the statute’s regulatory structure. Title IX expressly permits sex-separated athletics, and Congress reinforced that understanding through the Javits Amendment. West Virginia argued that this framework resolves the statutory question without requiring courts to redefine sex or transgender status under Title IX.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s questions suggested particular interest in this approach. She appeared skeptical of treating Title IX athletics as a domain where courts must engage in individualized justification inquiries. The statute and regulations, she implied, already reflect a legislative judgment that sex-based separation in sports is permissible.

The plaintiffs warned that this approach risks hollowing out Title IX’s nondiscrimination mandate. They argued that excluding a transgender girl from girls’ teams treats her worse because of sex, regardless of how the teams are labeled. From their perspective, focusing on the permissibility of sex-separated teams obscures the real question, which is whether the law denies an individual equal access to educational opportunities.

Justice Neil Gorsuch tested that argument with hypotheticals. He asked whether the “similarly situated” reasoning embraced by the 4th Circuit could justify other sex-based exclusions beyond sports. If schools may exclude transgender girls because they are not similarly situated to other girls, what prevents them from excluding girls from other programs based on asserted differences? The question highlighted the potential breadth of the plaintiffs’ theory.

West Virginia responded by insisting that sports are different. Physical differences matter in athletics in ways they do not elsewhere. Congress recognized that difference. The regulations codify it. Courts need not generalize from sports to other educational contexts.

Taken together, the arguments in Hecox and B.P.J. suggest a court searching for a way to uphold sex-based sports classifications without issuing a sweeping pronouncement about transgender status under the Constitution or Title IX.

The central question, stripped of rhetoric, is whether heightened scrutiny permits plaintiffs to win by showing that a general justification fails them individually. The states urged a categorical answer. Once a sex-based classification in sports is deemed substantially related to an important interest, the inquiry ends. The plaintiffs urged a more individualized approach, one that allows courts to ask whether the rule’s rationale actually applies to the person challenging it.

The oral arguments suggest that a majority of the court is inclined toward the former view. If that instinct prevails, the court’s decisions will likely turn on narrow grounds. In B.P.J., the court may rely on Title IX’s regulatory framework to uphold sex-separated athletics without deciding whether discrimination against transgender students is always discrimination on the basis of sex. In Hecox, it may resolve the case on mootness grounds or reaffirm that intermediate scrutiny tolerates generalizations even when they imperfectly fit at the margins.

Such outcomes would not resolve the broader debates that animate these cases. But they would mark a shift away from an equal protection analysis that demands close attention to fit and effect, toward one that treats administrability and legislative line drawing as decisive.

That choice may be framed as judicial restraint. For those excluded by the rules the court is asked to uphold, it will feel like something far less neutral.

This article was republished in partnership with Balls and Strikes.

In October 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Bostock v. Clayton County, a case about whether a federal civil rights law that prohibits employment discrimination based on “sex” extends to gay and transgender Americans too.

On paper, right-wing culture warriors had good reason to be optimistic that the court’s answer would be no. A year earlier, President Donald Trump had replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who occasionally sided with the liberals in cases about LGBTQ+ rights, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative with a track record of adopting the movement’s preferred positions when it mattered most. His confirmation gave the right what it had sought for decades: the five Supreme Court votes necessary to turn its policy agenda into binding precedent.

Eight months later, though, a six-justice majority of the court held that federal employment protections indeed protect trans people in the workplace. The basic logic of Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Bostock, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberals joined, is that if an employer treats a transgender man differently than it would treat a man assigned male at birth, the workplace is treating that trans man differently “because of sex.”

Conservative types who had expected Kavanaugh’s confirmation to pay immediate dividends promptly lost their minds. In a dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito called the majority’s argument “deceptive” and its conclusion “preposterous.” One conservative activist accused Gorsuch of abandoning textualism and succumbing to pressure from “college campuses and editorial boards”; another compared Bostock to Dred Scott, the 1857 Supreme Court case that denied citizenship to Black Americans and more or less started the Civil War. In a somber speech on the Senate floor, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley declared that the decision heralded “the end of the conservative legal movement.”

Bostock felt like ancient history on Tuesday morning, when the court heard oral argument in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. BPJ, two cases about state laws that ban trans women and girls from playing on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. This time, the members of the court’s conservative bloc sounded far more comfortable with imposing some limits on legal protections for trans people. In an exchange with West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams, Roberts sought to distinguish these cases from Bostock, asserting that a “sex-based classification” about sports eligibility might not “necessarily” implicate transgender status, and thus might not be discriminatory at all. Williams, realizing he was getting good news from a justice whose vote he needed, had the sense to quickly agree.

After Roberts, counting to five gets easy. Last year, in a different case about trans rights, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurrence, joined by Alito and Thomas, in which she opined that trans people are probably not a “suspect class” for purposes of equal protection and that trans sports bans are thus likely constitutional. Kavanaugh, another Bostock dissenter, did not join Barrett’s opinion, but his questions at oral argument in Hecox and BPJ suggest that he is willing to give states some flexibility in the name of preserving the sanctity of women’s sports. Even if—and this is a huge if—Gorsuch were to stick to the logic of Bostock, the conservatives still have the votes to allow lawmakers to legislate their trans constituents out of existence.

The shift from the court’s approach in Bostock has less to do with substantive legal issues than with the evolving social and political context in which the justices will decide these cases. Bostock came five years after the court’s landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the justices held that the Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry. Although conservatives mourned that case in the same way that they would mourn Bostock, Obergefell was consistent with established trends in public opinion: A month before the court decided the case, Gallup found that 60 percent of Americans supported marriage equality—an all-time high, and up from just 27 percent two decades earlier.

In the wake of Obergefell, legal protections for trans people seemed, for a moment, as if they might be on the same trajectory. North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” which Republicans passed in March 2016, was an economic and public relations disaster that cost the state thousands of jobs, billions in investment and tax revenue, and the privilege of hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. In a 2017 survey, about 70 percent of respondents said the country was becoming “more tolerant” of transgender people, and slightly more than 50 percent wanted the government to “do more to support and protect” them. To anyone whose brain was not pickled in right-wing media, Bostock was not some outrageous act of judicial overreach, but a simple, overdue acknowledgment of what most people believed that the law required.

The right responded as it has always responded to threats to its cultural relevance: by redoubling its efforts to incite a moral panic, vilifying trans people as dangerous and anti-woman. Since 2021, state lawmakers have introduced more than 2,500 bills that target trans people, including more than 1,000 just last year. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump, who during his first term sought to ban trans people from serving in the military, promised more of the same if voters returned him to the White House. Attack ads in swing states contrasted Democratic nominee Kamala Harris as “for they/them” and Trump as “for you.” In October, the month before the election, Fox News aired at least 47 segments about trans athletes, up from six in September—nearly a sevenfold increase.

This steady drumbeat of transphobic agitprop was maybe even more successful than its proponents had hoped. Today fundamental legal protections for trans people—the same protections the conservative-controlled court extended in Bostock—are less popular than they were three years ago, according to Pew Research Center data from February 2024. This is true among not only Republican voters but also Democrats looking to apportion blame for Harris’ loss. In the aftermath of the 2024 election, some Democratic politicians publicly argued that the party’s support for trans rights had contributed to its losses at the ballot box. One Democratic member of Congress went so far as to parrot vile anti-trans talking points to the New York Times, explaining that he did not “want to discriminate against anybody” but did not believe that “biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports.”

Back in 2018, YouGov found that 29 percent of Americans thought that society had gone “too far in accepting people who are transgender.” Today that number has increased to 36 percent. Support for explicitly anti-trans policies like bathroom bans, sports bans, and bans on gender-affirming care for young people is stronger than it was as recently as two years ago. Sports bans like those at issue in Hecox and BPJ are especially popular, supported by two-thirds of voters, including 45 percent of Democrats, according to Pew.

The most important predictor of the court’s behavior is its ideological composition. The confirmation of Barrett in late 2020, which cemented the current six-justice conservative supermajority, certainly made outcomes like Bostock less likely. But the court’s apparent willingness to retreat from Bostock in Hecox and BPJ is not just a product of its changing membership. It is also the result of a cynical campaign to dehumanize trans people and to ensure that whenever the court decided that it was ready to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, Americans who might have otherwise been supportive of those rights would be just fine with that result.

Perhaps the most ominous sign for the future of trans rights is that Trump’s 2024 election has emboldened anti-trans activists like never before. Since taking office, the president has issued executive orders that (among many other things) require passports to display the holder’s sex assigned at birth, that pull federal funding from certain providers of gender-affirming care, and that (again) ban trans people from military service. On its shadow docket, the court has backed Trump by rejecting requests to temporarily block some of these orders from taking effect. The result is a vicious cycle of bigotry: anti-trans voices persuading voters to elect anti-trans politicians who pass anti-trans laws blessed by anti-trans judges and celebrated in anti-trans media outlets, which then whip voters into an anti-trans frenzy all over again.

The eventual opinions in Hecox and BPJ will be long on legalese and explain in excruciating detail why, notwithstanding the result in Bostock, the court’s precedent empowers Republican lawmakers to stop trans women and girls from playing women’s and girls’ sports. The better explanation for the decisions will be much simpler: The conservative movement spent years working to prevent anything like Bostock from happening again. The justices are simply delivering the payoff.

            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/2026-election-midterms-democrats-blue-wave-analysis.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is going to be a chance to answer a pretty strange question: What if one of the most powerful and theoretically coveted jobs in the world was actually one that very few wanted to keep?

The job is that of a senator or a member of Congress. NPR is tracking the number of lawmakers who have decided to throw in the towel this year. It’s a record: By last count, we’ve got 11 senators headed for the exit and 47 House members doing the same. Some are running for a different office. Others have gotten sick. Still others, like Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene, have just decided to leave without even finishing out their terms.

Political scientist David Faris has been tracking all this too.

“There’s a sense that you can’t achieve anything in the American Congress right now,” Faris says. “It’s too broken. You have standard retirements compounded by a greater sense of the institution’s dysfunction and weakness vis-à-vis the executive branch.”

The congressional chaos is an opportunity for Democrats that will come mainly in November, when all 435 members of the House and a third of the Senate face their constituents in the 2026 midterms.

One of the things that’s helpful if you’re trying to predict what’s going to happen in these midterms is that we’ve been here before. Meaning: We’ve had a congressional election like this one, in 2018, two years after President Donald Trump was first sworn into office. Back then, Democrats gained 40 seats in the House—enough to retake the lower chamber of Congress. Members like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar were sent to Washington. According to Faris, the conditions leading up to that election were in some ways less favorable to Democrats than they are now.

Things are looking up for the party’s chances of retaking the House, and the Senate is in play in a way it wasn’t a year ago. But, he cautions, it’s all taking place against this backdrop of “very deep and persistent abnormality.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Faris about the case for a blue wave, and how to manage expectations for the midterms. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Polling is an interesting and important part of your case for why a blue wave is imaginable in 2026. You look at Democrats’ own internal polling for the past decade or so and see how it matches up with how the election actually went. And you say there’s been a shift. Can you explain that?

David Faris: Sure. In the off-year elections in 2025, which seem like 7,000 years ago but were actually two months ago, Democrats overperformed the public polling across the board in a way that they have never done in the Trump era. [These included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, Zohran Mamdani in New York, and smaller local contests.] These are races where we didn’t have good public polling but where Democrats clearly blew out the expectations in a pretty significant way.

Even in 2017, when Democrats won these same gubernatorial elections and we were all feeling good in roughly the same way, the candidate in Virginia did beat his polling, but the candidate in New Jersey did not. And you didn’t have a blowout victory in, say, the Virginia House of Delegates in the way that you did in 2025.

So the results just weren’t as definitive.

In 2017 they were pretty much across-the-board good. But what’s different is that Democrats beat their polling here, so there’s some evidence that if the electorate is composed roughly the same way in 2025 and 2026, it might actually be underestimating Democrats.

Right before the holiday break, there were a couple of prominent stories that have been on my mind, and I wanted to talk to you about them. One was in Politico, and the other was in New York magazine. They basically made opposite cases about this whole blue-wave notion. The Politico article looked at the prospects for Democrats to take the House and be competitive in the Senate, and it asserted that those prospects are a far cry from 2018 because a gerrymandered map is a tighter map for Democrats. They could get a lot of votes, but those votes are going to be diluted and it’s possible they won’t translate to seats—or at least not enough seats for what they call a comfortable majority. What do you make of this argument?

I don’t care how comfortable the victory is. It’s like if you’re running for a flight and you just slip in right as the door is closing at the gate, and they’re like, “We’re going to stick you in the back by the toilets.” I don’t care.

A five-seat majority is a five-seat majority. The reality is, if we have the gavel, we can do things that we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. Politico is not wrong about the obstacles to a truly historic wave happening here. I will note that if you go back to the past few cycles, these predictive analyses about what size margin the parties need to do X, Y, and Z have been very wrong. For example, there was a Brennan Center analysis in 2018 that said something like, “Democrats could win the national popular vote by 7 or 8 points and still not retake the House.” And that turned out not to be true.

One thing Republicans are really worried about right now actually does relate to the results in the Virginia House of Delegates. The way that Democrats were able to flip 13 seats in that chamber was by flipping a bunch of Trumpy districts. If Democrats could win double-digit Trump districts—in places where the president won by 10 points or more—and be competitive in those districts, then none of these gerrymanders are safe.

I mentioned that there were two articles. The other, in New York magazine, basically makes your case: The Democrats don’t need to do much to retake the House. They need to win a handful of seats. What I took away was that even if the party does well this cycle, it may still feel tight in Congress, and so the question becomes: How comfortable with acting aggressively in a tight environment are Democrats? Because, historically, they have not been comfortable in that situation, acting aggressively, right?

I think that this is a bigger problem in 2029 than in 2027. Say we have a new Democratic president with, like, a 10-seat majority in the House and a one-seat minority in the Senate. That’s when I would be worried about this narrative of “Wow, we didn’t do as well as we had hoped” or “This isn’t really that big of a repudiation of Trump, and maybe we better move to the center.” For taking one or both chambers of Congress as the opposition party, I’m not sure that those dynamics are as important for the next couple of years.

Can we look at the math here? If this blue wave is going to happen, Democrats need to flip three seats to claim a majority in the House, and four seats to win control of the Senate. That doesn’t seem like a lot when I say it out loud, but it can be, and I know that in the Senate it’s harder than in the House. Can you explain that a little bit?

The Senate is tricky because it is elected in three classes. Every two years, a third of the Senate is up for reelection.

And sometimes there are more Republican seats, and sometimes there are more Democratic seats, right?

Yes. So it’s an artifact of the map and the partisanship of the states at any given time, how good or bad your Senate map is for you. In 2018, when Republicans gained seats in the U.S. Senate, even in a Democratic-wave year, that was a famously horrific map for Democrats.

It’s not as horrific as 2018, but it’s not great. There’s Maine, where Susan Collins is like a zombie who keeps surviving election after election after election in a pretty blue-leaning state. In 2020 she beat her polls by, like, 9 points to hold that seat. I mean, it was unbelievable.

But it’s where Democrats are focusing. It seems as if there’s some navigability here. Where else are they focusing? Thom Tillis is retiring in North Carolina. Does that seem like a place Democrats are eyeing?

Yeah—every cycle we’re within 2 points of winning North Carolina, and every cycle we lose it by 2 points. But North Carolina was very close in 2024. And Democrats are playing defense in a bunch of Trump-voting states. Michigan and Georgia are probably the most important ones. Those are going to be tough races. And in Minnesota, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is retiring. If we lose any of those seats, we’re not taking the U.S. Senate. The optimistic case is that we hold those seats.

And then we get some kind of fantasy wish-cast Barbie Dream House candidates.

Yes, and this is the same position we were in in 2024, when we had to hold all the tough races, then we had to get a win in a couple of places where we haven’t won in a long time. And there was a brief moment in the summer of 2024 when it looked as if that might be possible. And then things ended up turning out very badly, including Bob Casey losing his seat in Pennsylvania. It complicates the math for Democrats in the Senate for the next six years, right? That was one of the worst outcomes of the night, in my mind, aside from, of course, that we elected a fascist who’s destroying the country.

Is there anything I’m leaving out here that we need to consider?

I do think that all the pieces of the optimism case tied together—like the big shift among Latino voters—will come into play in a really serious way. And young people. They did not drift right in the same way that the popular imagination says they did. But to the extent that they did, they flipped way back to 2018 levels of support for Democrats.

Gen Z men have never been as far right as people say they are. They’re still far more liberal than their elder counterparts. It’s just that what’s happening is that the young men who are on the right are, like, psychotic. The young men who vote Republican tend to be part of this shitposting internet culture—but the numbers aren’t there for them. Gen Z is still a far more liberal generation than Gen X–ers or boomers. But the people who are on the right are significantly more to the right than we would maybe like them to be.

This conversation feels less like “Get ready for a blue wave” and more “Get ready to feel the pain in some way.” Whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, whatever, pain is coming.

Our whole politics is painful right now. I sometimes feel embarrassed to walk into my political science classrooms. The students that I’m talking to, this is their whole conscious adult life. College freshmen right now were 8 years old when Trump walked down the escalator. And so their whole conscious experience of politics as a sentient, quasi-adult human is this nightmare politics that never ends. People don’t necessarily want to study politics under those conditions, and I can’t blame them.

In April 2010, a state-of-the-art offshore oil rig operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The blast killed 11 and ignited a fireball so large it could be seen from 40 miles away. For nearly three months, Americans watched as BP (formerly British Petroleum) tried desperately to cap the Macondo well 5,000 feet below the surface. More than 134 million gallons of oil blackened the Gulf from Florida to Texas.

The Deepwater Horizon spill remains one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. More than 15 years later, coastal communities in the Gulf are still recovering from the devastation of their economies and ecosystems. But the passage of time naturally dulls the horror for people farther away.

BP and the Trump administration appear to be counting on that. As the world fixates on Venezuela’s oil reserves, industry and regulators are quietly paving the way for reckless projects much closer to U.S. shores.

Indeed, the company responsible for Deepwater Horizon is trying to open its next chapter in the Gulf: a massive new hub for offshore drilling that could give it access to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently reviewing BP’s proposal for Kaskida, among the first of several planned ultra-deep-water oil projects. Although BOEM sent back BP’s initial proposal in August, the company has since resubmitted what the agency has characterized as minor modifications. BOEM now has until March to issue its decision.

The proposal itself is riddled with red flags, demonstrating that BP has not learned from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. It utterly fails to prove that the project could operate safely under the high temperatures and pressures of ultra-deep-water drilling. Instead, it seems the London-based company is hoping that Donald Trump’s obsession with fossil fuels will push it over the finish line.

I helped document the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon disaster as the lead investigator for the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission. President Barack Obama convened our bipartisan group of science, policy, and industry experts a month after the Macondo blowout began—and a good two months before the industry was able to cap it. As millions of gallons of oil were pumping daily into waters owned by the American public, the president gave us a simple but important job: Figure out what happened so that the oil industry, the federal government, and Gulf communities could ensure it would never happen again.

We wrote an entire book to document our technical findings, but it’s easy to sum up our broader observations: In the decades leading up to the disaster, oil companies had been undertaking riskier and riskier projects even as government safety standards grew increasingly outdated. Industry executives were trusting themselves to the point of willful ignorance. Ambition and shareholder pressure created a culture of complacency in which oil and gas executives convinced themselves that they could do no wrong, despite incidents that should have warned them otherwise.

Executives at BP and every other oil company all told me they never thought that something like the Deepwater blowout could happen. With billions of dollars at stake, they just couldn’t overcome the temptation to drink their own Kool-Aid.

Protecting people, private property, and our public lands from this kind of industry complacency is supposed to be the job of expert, nonpartisan regulators. But in the years leading up to Deepwater Horizon, fossil-friendly politicians of both parties had steadily starved regulatory agencies of resources, authority, and independence.

Scientists and engineers who were supposed to supervise the industry got captured by it instead. They knew that risks were increasing as the wells were getting deeper and more dangerous, but they trusted the oil companies’ assurances. Our report found that by the time of the Deepwater Horizon calamity, federal regulators had been routinely rubber-stamping new ventures into deep water.

The underwater volcano of oil from the Macondo well blew apart BP’s complacency—for a time. The company was forced to reckon with the reality that no one knew how to stop a blowout from a well as big and as deep as Macondo. BP’s drilling proposal for the well should have provided a viable plan for a worst-case scenario, but it didn’t. And overwhelmed and underresourced regulators didn’t respond to that gigantic red flag.

We had a major opportunity to learn from Deepwater Horizon. But other industry players distanced themselves from BP rather than internalize the lessons. When I talked to them, they appeared to be in denial. While I wasn’t entirely shocked when BP executives told me that they never thought a blowout like Macondo could happen on one of their projects, I was stunned when other industry execs insisted that it would not have happened on any of their projects.

None of them recognized that their company’s hubris was just one instance of an industrywide culture of complacency.

The public should expect our government to address this complacency through expert oversight. But 15 years on, and despite the dedicated advocacy of the bipartisan Deepwater Horizon commission and others, Congress has done nothing to address the budgetary and structural problems that plague the agencies tasked with providing it. Congress hasn’t touched the liability limits that enable the industry to gamble with public health. The Department of the Interior did issue modest improvements to drilling regulations in 2016, but it rolled them back during the first Trump administration in what the American Petroleum Institute hailed as a “modernization” effort.

The second Trump administration has been even friendlier to industry. Executive orders have reversed a number of Biden-era offshore restrictions to fast-track permitting and weaken technical requirements (e.g., adjusting various technical constraints to allow drilling under higher pressures and enable more output). The Elon Musk–led DOGE project also shuttered regional offices and fired regulators.

The administration’s quest to accelerate drilling with inadequate regulations and fewer regulators is a recipe for disaster that leaves the industry largely to its own devices. And judging by its half-baked proposals, BP has either forgotten the lessons of what it termed a “catastrophe” or decided that catastrophe is an acceptable risk. After all, the company’s shareholders can still count on the American taxpayer and the communities of the Gulf to bear most of the costs of a spill, just as they did last time.

The proposed Kaskida project is even riskier than Macondo was. It is over 1,000 feet deeper, and drilling overall is becoming more challenging as ever-stronger storms rip across a heating Gulf with ever-increasing regularity. Yet BP’s proposal reveals that the company is not meaningfully better prepared to cap a deep-water well than it was 15 years ago. It took 87 days to cap Deepwater Horizon; according to the BP proposal, it would take 90 to 100 days to stop a spill from Kaskida.

Members of Congress have found even that dismal figure optimistic, concluding that the company underestimates the magnitude of a worst-case scenario at Kaskida by using a questionable methodology. In a scathing letter to BOEM in August, lawmakers urged Acting Director Matthew Giacona to reject the project. They correctly noted that BP’s proposal “fails to meet basic regulatory standards,” including neglecting to show that the company possesses the necessary equipment to contain a high-pressure spill. Under the law, the fact that BP hasn’t met current regulatory standards should be sufficient to deny the application.

Yet it seems that federal agencies have gone from merely failing to regulate the oil industry to actively advocating for it. The first Trump administration saw oil companies as its “partners.” The second Trump administration treats them as its “customers.”

Fossil-fuel giants have, of course, exploited the White House’s “customer service” stance to demand accelerated approval of new oil and gas pipelines and export terminals. They’re scrambling to secure long-term leases to some of the more than 1 billion acres of our public waters that the administration is offering up for drilling. They aim to lock in lengthy property rights and economic advantages that will insulate them from the reality of the inevitable clean-energy transition. That includes a new era of ultra-deep and high-risk drilling in the Gulf.

Kaskida is very much part of this pattern. And it’s just the beginning: BP has already submitted an additional production proposal for another ultra-deep-water project called Tiber, and companies like Chevron and Beacon Offshore Energy have proposed a slew of multibillion-dollar ultra-deep-water projects in the Gulf.

Even as the administration is bending over backward to green-light risky offshore oil projects, it is doing all it can to stop renewable-energy projects that create jobs and deliver gigawatts with far less pollution and climate impact. If BP were proposing to build wind towers instead of drill wells at Kaskida, it wouldn’t have a chance.

The Trump administration and BP are trying to carry on as if nothing has changed since Deepwater Horizon. In some ways, they’re right. The regulations still are not strong enough, the companies aren’t any wiser, and there’s even more oil money in politics.

But some things have changed. Renewable energy has become cheaper and increasingly more reliable than fossil energy, and it is getting more so every day. At the same time, the risks of fossil-fuel extraction are a lot less hypothetical. Every American adult can summon up searing images from the Deepwater Horizon spill.

We know that the oil industry has not operated in good faith, that our regulators aren’t protecting us, and that the American public, particularly Gulf communities, will bear the costs of the next disaster. If we witness another Deepwater Horizon, no one will be in a position to plead ignorance.

            <h2>CrowdStrike shareholders lose battle to recoup losses from 2024 outage</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/crowdstrike_shareholders_lawsuit_dismiss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of CrowdStrike shareholders who sued the company over losses sustained following its 2024 global outage will have to head back to the drawing board if they hope to recoup losses, as a Texas judge has deemed they failed to adequately state a claim.

The plaintiffs in the case alleged 15 statements from CrowdStrike leadership were misleading. US District Judge Robert Pitman of the Western District of Texas ruled [PDF] on Monday that, while he agreed two of those statements were plausibly misleading, the shareholders failed to plausibly plead that they were made with the intent to defraud investors, a required element of a securities-fraud claim.

&quot;Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly plead a strong inference of scienter [intent or knowledge of wrongdoing] for the individual Defendants or for CrowdStrike itself,&quot; Pitman opined. &quot;Thus, even though the Court found … that Plaintiffs had plausibly alleged two misleading statements, the Court will grant Defendants&#39; motion to dismiss.&quot;

For those who don&#39;t recall CrowdStrike&#39;s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day in July 2024, the world ground to a halt after the company pushed a faulty Falcon sensor content configuration update for Windows. Millions of machines around the world promptly face-planted into blue screens of death.

The update was malformed, and CrowdStrike&#39;s internal validation system, designed to ensure updates didn&#39;t cause serious snafus, failed to catch the issue, as the company later explained in a post-mortem. CrowdStrike acknowledged it had made a mistake, causing its share price to plummet and leaving the company with months of uncertainty for investors, many of whom are institutional.

One such institutional group was the Plymouth County Retirement Association, which filed a lawsuit in July 2024. Other parties signed on to the suit, turning it into a class action complaint under the leadership of New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund, one of the institutional CrowdStrike investors who lost money following the outage. Pitman dismissed the case this week.

He&#39;s previously dismissed other suits related to the outage, too.

In June of last year, he tossed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike filed by a group of airline customers who were left stranded following the outage. Plaintiffs in that case sought relief for their inconveniences from CrowdStrike, arguing that the company&#39;s sloppy update screening process ended up costing them time and money they wanted back.

Pitman dismissed that case on the grounds that the federal Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) preempted the passengers&#39; claims, because the alleged harm was &quot;related to&quot; airline services such as scheduling and boarding, triggering the ADA&#39;s preemption clause. The fact that the passengers sued CrowdStrike rather than the airlines themselves didn&#39;t change the analysis, Pitman said, because the claims were still &quot;related to&quot; airline services and therefore barred.

He also ruled in favor of CrowdStrike over statements made by its president, Michael Sentonas, who said in an April 2023 investor briefing that CrowdStrike&#39;s agent architecture does not trigger blue screens when updates fail.

&quot;Agent cloud architecture … doesn&#39;t require a massive tuning burden and doesn&#39;t blue screen endpoints with failed updates,&quot; court documents quote Sentonas as saying.

As CrowdStrike argued in its motion to dismiss, Sentonas&#39; statement was not a promise that CrowdStrike could never trigger a blue screen outage under any circumstances.

&quot;The Court agrees with Defendant that this statement by Defendant Sentonas is not actionable,&quot; Pitman decided in his dismissal order, further describing it as &quot;arguably immaterial puffery&quot; rather than a concrete claim capable of supporting a securities-fraud charge.

&quot;We appreciate the Court&#39;s thoughtful consideration and decision to dismiss this case,&quot; CrowdStrike Chief Legal Officer Cathleen Anderson told The Register.

We note the case was dismissed without prejudice, and Pitman has given the plaintiffs a chance to file an amended complaint, so the case isn&#39;t over yet.

When asked how it plans to respond, DiNapoli&#39;s office only told us that &quot;the decision is under review.&quot;

Delta Air Lines, which also sued CrowdStrike to recover damages from the outage, has defeated a motion to dismiss its own lawsuit against the company in Georgia state court. That case is ongoing. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google on Wednesday began inviting Gemini users to let its chatbot read their Gmail, Photos, Search history, and YouTube data in exchange for possibly more personalized responses.

Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs, Gemini and AI Studio, announced the beta availability of Personal Intelligence in the US. Access will roll out over the next week to US-based Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers.

The use of the term &quot;Intelligence&quot; is more aspirational than accurate. Machine learning models are not intelligent; they predict tokens based on training data and runtime resources.

Perhaps &quot;Personalized Predictions&quot; would be insufficiently appealing and &quot;Personalized Artificial Intelligence&quot; would draw too much attention to the mechanized nature of chatbots that now attracts active opposition. Whatever the case, access to personal data comes with the potential for more personally relevant AI assistance.

Woodward explains that Personal Intelligence can refer information from Google apps like Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube to the company&#39;s Gemini model. This may help the model respond to queries using personal or app-specific data within those applications.

&quot;Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,&quot; said Woodward. &quot;It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.&quot;

As an example, Woodward recounted how he was shopping for tires recently. While he was standing in line for service, he didn&#39;t know the tire size and needed his license plate number. So he asked Gemini and the model fetched that information by scanning his photo library, finding an image of his car, and converting the imaged license plate to text.

Whether that scenario is better than recalling one&#39;s plate number from memory, searching for it on phone-accessible messages, or glancing at the actual plate in the parking lot depends on whether one sees the mind as a use-it-or-lose-it resource. Every automation is an abdication of autonomy.

To Google&#39;s credit, Personal Intelligence is off by default and must be enabled per app. If Personal Intelligence is anything like AI Overviews or Gemini in Google Workspace apps, expect notifications, popups, hints, nudges, and recommendations during app interactions as a way to encourage adoption.

Woodward argues that what differentiates Google&#39;s approach from rival AI agents is that user data &quot;already lives at Google securely.&quot; There&#39;s no privacy intrusion when the call is coming from inside the house.

Gemini, he said, will attempt to cite the source of output based on personalization, so recommendations can be verified or corrected. And there are &quot;guardrails&quot; in place that try to avoid bringing sensitive information (e.g. health data) into Gemini conversations, like &quot;I&#39;ve cancelled your appointments next year based on your prognosis in Gmail.&quot;

It&#39;s ancient history now but in 2012, when Google changed its privacy policy to share data across its different services, that was controversial. The current trend is to encourage customer complicity in data sharing.

Woodward insists Google&#39;s aim is to provide a better Gemini experience while keeping personal data secure and under the user&#39;s control.

&quot;Built with privacy in mind, Gemini doesn&#39;t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library,&quot; he said. &quot;We train on limited info, like specific prompts in Gemini and the model&#39;s responses, to improve functionality over time.&quot;

Pointing to his anecdote about his vehicle, he said that Google would not use the photos of the relevant road trip, the license plate in those photos, or his Gmail messages for model training. But the prompts and responses, filtered to remove personal information, would get fed back to the model as training data.

&quot;In short, we don&#39;t train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it,&quot; he said.

Google&#39;s Gemini Apps Privacy Hub page offers a more comprehensive view of how Google uses the information made available to its AI model.

The company says that human reviewers (including trained reviewers from partner service providers) review some of the data that it collects for purposes like improving and maintaining services, customization, measurement, and safety. &quot;Please don&#39;t enter confidential information that you wouldn&#39;t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve our services, including machine-learning technologies,&quot; it warns.

The personalization with Connected Apps page offers a similar caution.

Google&#39;s support boilerplate also states that Gemini models may provide inaccurate or offensive responses that do not reflect Google&#39;s views.

&quot;Don&#39;t rely on responses from Gemini Apps as medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice,&quot; Google&#39;s documentation says.

But for anything less consequential, maybe Personal Intelligence will help. ®

            <h2>New Linux malware targets the cloud, steals creds, and then vanishes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/voidlink_linux_malware/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A brand-new Linux malware named VoidLink targets victims&#39; cloud infrastructure with more than 30 plugins that allow attackers to perform a range of illicit activities, from silent reconnaissance and credential theft to lateral movement and container abuse.

When VoidLink detects tampering or malware analysis on an infected machine, it can delete itself and invoke anti-forensics modules designed to remove traces of its activity.

In December, Check Point Research discovered the previously unseen malware samples written in Zig for Linux and appearing to originate from a Chinese-affiliated development environment with a command-and-control interface localized for Chinese operators.

The developers referred to it internally as &quot;VoidLink,&quot; and the samples seemed to indicate an in-progress malware framework rather than a finished tool.

&quot;The framework&#39;s intended use remains unclear, and as of this writing, no evidence of real-world infections has been observed,&quot; the research team said in a Tuesday report. &quot;The way it is built suggests it may ultimately be positioned for commercial use, either as a product offering or as a framework developed for a customer.&quot;

It&#39;s especially notable for two things. First, VoidLink is specifically designed to run in Linux-based cloud environments. After infecting a victim&#39;s machine, it scans for and detects AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent, and its developers plan to add detections for Huawei, DigitalOcean, and Vultr.

While malware operators have traditionally focused on Windows-based systems, VoidLink&#39;s cloud-first focus is significant. Government agencies, global enterprises, critical infrastructure and other high-value attack targets increasingly run on cloud-based services and host their most sensitive systems in the cloud - so malware that hunts for infected machines&#39; public cloud providers is likely to reap bigger rewards for government-sponsored spies as well as financially-motivated ransomware gangs.

In addition to its cloud-detection capabilities, VoidLink is notable for its custom loaders, implants, rootkits, and numerous modules that provide attackers with a whole range of stealthy, operational-security capabilities, making it &quot;far more advanced than typical Linux malware,&quot; according to Check Point.

The framework includes multiple kernel-level rootkits, and chooses which one to deploy based on the environment where it runs. VoidLink also uses the rootkits to hide its processes, files, network sockets, and the rootkit modules themselves.

It uses a custom API, which the threat hunters describe as very similar to and likely inspired by Cobalt Strike&#39;s Beacon API. And it has at least 37 plugins - all of which are detailed in Check Point&#39;s analysis, so give that a read - that the developers organize by category.

&quot;The framework is designed for long-term access, surveillance, and data collection rather than short-term disruption,&quot; Check Point research said in a subsequent blog about VoidLink. &quot;Its design reflects a level of planning and investment typically associated with professional threat actors rather than opportunistic attackers, raising the stakes for defenders who may never realize their infrastructure has been quietly taken over.&quot; ®

            <h2>Ignore rosy datacenter expansion projections – there isn't enough power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/14/datacenter_expansion_power_limit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A looming shortage of electrical power is set to constrain datacenter expansion, potentially leaving many industry growth forecasts looking overly optimistic.

In its latest report, &quot;Five Predictions for 2026,&quot; Uptime Institute says that power will become the defining constraint on datacenter growth in 2026 and beyond.

This is because it simply isn&#39;t possible to add extra grid and generating capacity at the same rate as new server farms are popping up, so something is going to have to give.

The AI-driven infrastructure boom can be traced back to the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022. But even before that, a shortage of available power saw moratoriums slapped on new datacenter builds in Amsterdam, Dublin, and Singapore, as well as delays to projects elsewhere.

Since then, the rate at which new capacity is added has effectively doubled, with Uptime estimating that the total global datacenter power load associated with AI will hit 10 GW by the end of 2026.

Part of the problem is that some of the planned AI facilities are enormous, but these can likely still be built in about three years, while a large solar farm takes about five years, a wind farm or gas turbine generator site around six, and nuclear power plants at least a decade.

When average datacenter sizes were smaller, pockets of spare grid capacity could be found to serve them, Uptime says. But today, projects are being measured in hundreds of megawatts, and even gigawatt facilities are planned. Sourcing this amount of power in the timescales needed is a challenge in almost any location.

The first wave of large campuses opted for one of two strategies to secure large amounts of power at short notice, the report states – on-site gas turbines or to repurpose power formerly used by cryptocurrency miners.

But high demand means that buyers are now facing shortages of gas turbine generator equipment, with a three to four-year waiting list, and prices have doubled in some markets.

Meanwhile, the supply of available sites formerly occupied by cryptocurrency mining operations in places where power is (or was) plentiful and cheap, is running out.

Uptime spells out the bottom line bluntly: &quot;It is unclear how the industry will continue to deliver capacity at the rate that many projections forecast.&quot;

But even if datacenter growth slows, there still remains the problem of their greenhouse gas emissions, and operators will increasingly consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) schemes in future, the report claims.

A projected 75-125 GW growth in server farm power requirements through 2030 will likely have to be met through on-site and grid-based natural gas generation, putting the industry&#39;s aggressive net-zero emission commitments at risk.

These commitments can&#39;t simply be disregarded, as they are enforced by regulations in some regions, or baked into contracts with enterprise customers, which need to account for emissions in their own corporate sustainability reports.

However, Uptime notes that of six carbon capture technologies it identifies, only amine solvent systems are commercially available. These systems use absorption by chemical solvents to remove carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas stream.

There are five others, of which solid sorbent and chilled ammonia systems appear to be the most promising, but these are still in early development and not markedly cheaper or more efficient, the report states.

But storage of captured carbon is a major limiting factor in the adoption of such systems, depending on the availability of an accessible (and permitted) geological formation for this purpose. This could become a significant factor in where datacenters are sited, Uptime states, and will also likely rule out retrofitting CCS systems to most existing generation capacity.

According to the report, Google has already inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a gas-fired generator site using CCS in Illinois, while Microsoft has expressed its openness to procuring electricity from such facilities.

One of the main issues facing CCS systems to date has been cost, but Uptime says the economics look better compared with the cost of procuring carbon offsets or energy attribute certificates (EACs), which can range from $10 to $1,000 per metric ton. The cost of electricity from a generator site using CCS will be comparable to or less expensive than buying energy plus offsets, making it competitive with other low-carbon energy options.

Interestingly, Uptime claims that amid all the AI hype, most datacenter operators are &quot;continuing to plan in the face of uncertainty,&quot; rather than executing on clearly AI-driven demand. Meanwhile, the need for general-purpose compute, storage, and connectivity remains strong and is likely to persist regardless of the trajectory of AI applications.

But a segmentation in the industry is emerging. The most demanding AI workloads are driving a distinct class of high-density infrastructure with greater power and cooling requirements. The majority of datacenter capacity, however, continues to support more traditional workloads. This separation may ultimately benefit the industry by clarifying risks, investment priorities, and operational strategies. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A fraud-detection AI model trained on COVID-19 loan data could have flagged potentially tens of billions of dollars in payments before they went out, reducing the feds&#39; pay-and-chase cleanup, the US government&#39;s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee told Congress on Tuesday.

Hindsight is 20/20, of course, and the roughly five million Small Business Administration COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan applications used to train PRAC&#39;s &quot;Fraud Prevention Engine&quot; were only available after the programs were already up and running, by which point billions of dollars had been paid out and later identified as potentially fraudulent.

Regardless, PRAC executive director Ken Dieffenbach told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee at a Tuesday hearing that it&#39;s time to put those lessons to work to prevent other cases of government fraud, something that the Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders ostensibly care a great deal about.

&quot;The time is now to use this data to prevent fraud schemes before taxpayer dollars are lost and hold wrongdoers accountable,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Committee.

According to the PRAC director, the Fraud Prevention Engine was developed as a proof of concept &quot;to determine if such a model could be developed and to identify and address any technical hurdles.&quot; By Dieffenbach&#39;s account, it appears the project was a success.

The Engine was built with a bunch of modular components, including unsupervised machine learning models used to detect anomalies, supervised ML that identifies patterns consistent with pandemic fraud cases, and rules-based flags that catch invalid Social Security and employer identification numbers. According to Dieffenbach, such small anomalies can often identify hidden connections, like shared bank account numbers among supposedly independent applicants, that suggest fraud.

And it can do it quickly: Dieffenbach said the AI can process 20,000 applications per second.

&quot;We estimate that had our Fraud Prevention Engine been in use in March 2020 it would have quickly … flagged potentially tens of billions of dollars in payments for further scrutiny before the funds were disbursed,&quot; Dieffenbach told the Oversight Committee.

PRAC says it has helped recover just over $500 million so far, a small fraction of the payments Dieffenbach says the Engine could have flagged before disbursement.

In other words, there&#39;s a lot of work to be done, and that&#39;s just on pandemic fraud. Dieffenbach isn&#39;t stopping the Fraud Prevention Engine&#39;s work at PRAC&#39;s COVID loan recovery efforts, though.

Trump&#39;s budget reconciliation bill passed last summer extended PRAC&#39;s mandate to cover fraud detection and prevention in programs funded under the law, pushed the Committee&#39;s end date out to September 30, 2034, and provided $88 million in funding to support its expanded oversight work.

Since then, PRAC has begun working with Inspectors General across multiple agencies to deploy the Fraud Prevention Engine and related analytics in support of oversight of programs funded by the reconciliation law. Dieffenbach said the effort has already helped identify specific programs where PRAC&#39;s data and technology can provide valuable insights.

&quot;We have identified several specific programs where our data and technology can provide valuable insights,&quot; the director said.

Pete Sessions (R-TX), a member of the Oversight Committee, says the Engine needs to find a permanent home before PRAC disbands in eight years.

&quot;A permanent solution that maintains the analytic capacities and capabilities that have been built over the past six years is necessary and needed,&quot; Sessions said. &quot;Its database is billions of records deep and it has begun to pay for itself.&quot;

We reached out to PRAC to learn if it&#39;s been in discussions to find a permanent home for the Engine, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The French data protection regulator, CNIL, today issued a collective €42 million ($48.9 million) fine to two French telecom companies for GDPR violations stemming from a data breach.

Free and Free Mobile are two separate businesses, respectively overseeing fixed-line and mobile services, owned by Iliad Group. The fines relate to an October 2024 breach that led to the data of more than 24 million individuals being compromised, including financial information such as IBANs.

In its judgment, CNIL noted that the attack began on September 28, 2024, and the companies were made aware of the intrusion on October 21 via a message from the attacker responsible. Free ousted the attacker from its systems the following day.

The attackers gained access to Free&#39;s network via the company VPN before connecting to Free Mobile&#39;s subscriber management tool, MOBO. Even though the attacker only gained access to Free Mobile&#39;s application, MOBO, at the time, allowed users to search for the data belonging to customers of both Free and Free Mobile, including their IBANs, provided they were subscribers of services.

A post-mortem of the attack revealed that the attacker began exfiltrating customer records on October 6, 2024, including those related to the total 24,633,469 fixed and mobile contracts. This was broken down into 19,460,891 Free Mobile contacts and 5,172,577 Free contracts.

At the time of the attack, Free Mobile had around 15.5 million subscribers, while Free had approximately 7.6 million. The companies were fined €27 million ($31.4 million) and €15 million ($17.4 million), respectively, based on Iliad&#39;s €10 billion turnover and €367 million profit posted in 2024.

The regulator said that the companies contravened GDPR in three ways: by failing to properly secure personal data, failing to adequately communicate the breach to those affected, and failing to comply with data retention laws.

Announcing the fine, CNIL said: &quot;The restricted panel found that on the day of the data breach, the companies had not implemented certain basic security measures that could have made the attack more difficult.

&quot;In particular, it noted that the authentication procedure for connecting to the VPN of Free Mobile and to that of Free – used especially for remote work by the company&#39;s employees – was not sufficiently robust.

&quot;Furthermore, the measures deployed by Free Mobile and Free to detect abnormal behavior on their information systems were ineffective.&quot;

The nature of the data that was stolen came into consideration when deciding the fine, as did the companies&#39; data retention policies.

CNIL noted that both Free and Free Mobile lacked the necessary capabilities to sort former subscribers&#39; data in a way that retained only the necessary information for accounting purposes.

They also lacked an adequate data-deletion mechanism at the time of the attack, and when it came to notifying their users about the attack, the initial email lacked key details users needed for a comprehensive understanding of its consequences. ®

If you’re looking for a simple way to streamline your workflow, the Elgato Stream Deck Plus is a handy productivity tool for automating everyday tasks. Right now, it’s on sale for $159.99 ($40 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is its best price to date.

Like the standard Stream Deck, the Stream Deck Plus comes with eight programmable keys you can use to automate tasks, such as muting yourself on a video call or turning off smart lights. The Plus, however, adds more customizability with four rotary dials that let you make fine adjustments, like changing the volume for a specific app.

The dials are especially useful for controlling music. With a single dial, you skip forward or backward through a Spotify playlist, then press it to pause or play. On a standard Stream Deck, you’d need multiple buttons to do the same thing. Elgato also includes “Dial Stacks,” which let each dial handle multiple functions you can cycle through. A slim touchscreen above the dials shows what each control is currently assigned to and lets you swipe between different pages within a profile. And while the touchscreen itself can’t trigger plug-ins like the regular buttons, Elgato’s since released software updates that let you assign up to three standard button or plugin actions to each dial, making the Stream Deck Plus far more useful than it was at launch.

Verizon phones across the US have had trouble connecting since about noon Eastern, Verizon says it’s aware of the issue.

The first big outage of 2026 is here, as Verizon customers across the US, including several of our phones, complain that service has been spotty or nonexistent starting at around noon ET, with phones switching to SOS Mode and being unable to connect.

This cell service outage follows a “software issue” that cut off service for many people in August for several hours, and while Verizon has acknowledged the issue, there is no word yet on when it will be fixed.

We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.

The most recent update from Verizon’s news account on X posted at 4:12PM ET says:

Verizon’s team is on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers. We know this is a huge inconvenience, and our top priority is to get you back online and connected as fast as possible. We appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue.

On DownDetector, the number of reports listed has dropped to about 50,000 after peaking with around 175,000 at around 1PM ET, but according to our own testing, as well as other posts on social media, many phones are still offline or only connecting intermittently. We have contacted Verizon, and will update this article when more information is available.

Update, January 14th: Added 4:12PMET Verizon update.

You can add a numpad, trackball, touchpad, or a 3D controller called Float.

Naya has already shipped one successful Kickstarter for a weird keyboard. The Naya Create was an ergonomic split deck with four swappable controller addons: a touchpad, a trackball, a rotary encoder, or a 6DoF spatial mouse. The Connect takes that modular concept, applies it to a more traditional flat keyboard form factor, and expands the ecosystem to be even more flexible. And clearly, people are into the idea, because it hit its minuscule funding goal in just six minutes.

The Naya Connect has four main components: a low-profile 75% mechanical keyboard called the Naya Type, a 24-key multipad, a six-key programmable strip, and a dock. The dock has four keys and a slot for one of the same four swappable controllers as the Create. If you can’t decide between a full-size keyboard or a compact one, a trackball or a mouse, this could solve your indecision.

Each piece has magnetic connectors, and they can be arranged in almost any combination: want a giant rotary controller to the left of the keyboard and a touchpad on the right? Go ahead. You can put the multipad on the left in case you’re left-handed, or put one on each side for dual sets of macros.

The All-in bundle, which includes one of everything, including two docks, will set you back €568, or about $662. The cheapest bundle with a dock and just the touchpad controller is €187 (about $218). Of course, all the usual Kickstarter disclaimers still apply.

It’s a voice actor from the games, but not the one you’re thinking.

Amazon has announced the first cast member of its God of War live-action adaptation on Prime Video. Ryan Hurst, known for his work as Opie in Sons of Anarchy and Beta in The Walking Dead, will play the titular God of War, Kratos. Though the casting might come as a bit of a disappointment to the fans hopeful that Christopher Judge, Kratos’ award-winning voice actor in the games, might have been tapped for the role in some fashion, Hurst has familiarity with series. He voiced Thor in God of War: Ragnarok and earned a BAFTA nomination for the performance.

Amazon originally announced the God of War series in 2022 in collaboration with PlayStation Productions. It’ll follow the journey of Kratos and his son Atreus outlined in the most recent God of War games and is currently one of several live-action video game adaptations in the works from both Amazon and Sony. The Last of Us (Sony) is currently working toward a third season, a Horizon Zero Dawn (Sony) show is in the works at Netflix, Fallout (Amazon) is currently in the middle of airing its second season, while Tomb Raider (Amazon) has recently announced its principle cast.

The upcoming M3 will be BMW’s first proper all-electric M-series sports car. Its quad motor setup is sure to pack a punch.

BMW teased its forthcoming all-electric M-series performance sedan today, promising that the quad-motor M3 sports car would feature specs that are truly next level when it arrives in 2027.

The M3 will have four electric motors and simulated gear shifting, a feature that is quickly becoming a must-have for electrified sports cars. BMW says the setup unlocks the benefits of both rear and all-wheel drive, with the ability to decouple the front axle.

Four motors, though, is a bit of an outlier in the performance world. Tri-motors, sure, you can find plenty, like Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire. But four motors are bit a rarer: the only ones I could think of are the Rivian R1T and R1S Quad, Rimac Nevera, and the electric Mercedes G-Wagen (or G580 with EQ Technology, if you prefer).

The electric M3 will also be built on BMW’s Neue Klasse platform that promises more efficient batteries, lightning fast charging, and higher powered computers. The architecture will be 800-volt, the regenerative braking will be highly efficient, and if the camouflaged pictures are any indication, it will be a real looker on the streets.

Speaking of computers, the M3 will have four of them, unified under its oddly named “Heart of Joy” component that aggregates all the traction, stability, and electric motor management functions of the vehicle. That means when software updates are made available, the vehicle’s brain will be able to receive them over-the-air faster than BMW’s current processors.

The M3’s simulated gear shifting will feature a “newly developed soundscape” that “channels pure emotion.” Like other automakers, BMW is loathe to alienate its loyal M-series customers by giving them all the torque but none of the gearing feedback. And now a fake “soundscape” will accompany all that shifting. Porsche, Hyundai, and Dodge are also on board the fake EV gear shifting bandwagon.

BMW has been promising a proper electric M-series for years, after releasing a string of i-series M performance vehicles. The upcoming M3 will be the first to bear the proper M badge, but certainly not the last.

Never get locked out again with a smart lock you can control from your phone, with your face, or with a fingerprint.

A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.

One of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.

For most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.

Having a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.

I’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don’t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.

I install each lock on one of four exterior doors and use it daily for at least a week. I evaluate the ease of installation and setup, including adding codes and registering biometrics such as fingerprints, faces, or palms. I connect the locks to various smart home platforms and test integrations through automations and routines.I assess all control methods offered — physical keys, codes, biometrics, Home Key, and auto-lock/unlock — checking for speed and reliability. I test remote features like app control, code sharing, and platform integrations.Design, aesthetics, and how the lock pairs with devices like video doorbells are also considered. I test accessories like external keypads and any unique features offered. For battery life, I estimate the duration based on performance during my testing window and conduct long-term testing on top picks.

A good smart lock should have at least three ways to unlock in case one method fails. My favorites are fingerprint and keypad since they don’t require you to carry anything with you, but other options include phone apps, auto-unlock via geofencing, voice control from your phone or watch, physical keys, NFC fobs, and Apple Home Key. Home Key is awesome, but you have to have an iPhone or Apple Watch — for now. Every smart lock in this list also has the option to auto-lock after a set time. This means you don’t have to remember to physically lock your door.

A key feature of a smart lock is the ability to control your lock when you’re away from home, either remotely using the app or by sending a code to someone so they can manually unlock it. My preferred option is remote control, as sometimes it’s just easier to unlock the door for someone and then lock it when they leave, even if you’re 2,000 miles away.

Smart locks broadly use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and/or Thread to allow you to control them from an app. My least favorite option is a Bluetooth lock that uses a dedicated bridge to connect to Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is power-hungry and drains batteries fast, so some door locks use a bridge as an intermediary. This is fiddly and annoying (especially if someone unplugs it accidentally). I prefer locks with built-in Wi-Fi or those that can connect to a multi-purpose hub or bridge, such as an Apple Home Hub or an Echo smart speaker. Locks that connect over Thread are starting to become more popular; they require a Thread border router, but offer longer battery life and out-of-home control.

Most Wi-Fi smart locks have a battery life of under six months, which is a pain. Those that use Bluetooth last longer, but need that extra hub or bridge for out-of-home control. Thread is a new connectivity option that promises longer battery life but also requires a second device (a Thread border router). (See the FAQ for more on this.)

The lock should have the option to assign “virtual keys” or unique codes to other household members, service people, or a neighbor looking in on your dog. These should be easily revoked or assigned only for specific times. The app should also have a log/alerts that let you know who accessed your door and when.

A good smart lock should be compatible with at least some of the major platforms, so you can schedule the lock, set up home automation routines, and use features like tapping your phone to your door to unlock it. New standards like Matter and Aliro are working to bring universal compatibility between smart locks, smartphones, and smart home platforms. (See the FAQ for more on this.)

Excellent auto-unlock functionChoice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-ThreadGreat designDiscreet door sensorCan be rekeyed

Have to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlockNo Home Key or biometric accessTouchscreen shows fingerprintsProminent Kwikset branding

Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Thread / Access options: Key, keycode, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade AAA / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)

The Kwikset Halo Select is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.

I strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)

Of the four entry methods — a keyway (which is re-keyable), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.

My experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.

The Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time, as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.

The Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one.

If you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup, so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.

Kwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing

Matter-over-Thread does promise better battery life — and long-term testing bears this out — as well as the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.

It’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.

Kwikset recently launched the Halo Select Plus, which we’re currently testing. This adds Apple Home Key support, but at $329, you’re paying a lot more for this one added function. Other recent updates include new finishes for the Halo Select line.

Inexpensive Good fingerprint readerOffline access codesLong battery life

No Wi-Fi No smart home supportLarge rear housing

Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0 / Access options: Fingerprint, keypad, app / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: One year / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: N/A

The Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list.

In addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).

The Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems

The Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.

But without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing.

Since I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its Wyze Video Doorbell Pro that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.

Lightning fastNice, compact designSimple to installSupports Wi-Fi and Matter over ThreadNo account requiredBroad smart home compatibility

No Apple Home KeyProprietary charging cableNo door sensor included

Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Non-removable, rechargeable / Battery life: Up to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings

The Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter over Thread, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.

Whereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.

The Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.

If you don’t have a Matter hub and a Thread border router — like a HomePod — Nuki’s Premium service provides remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Nuki Premium was previously offered as a monthly subscription, but as of December 3rd, 2025, the cost is now folded into the purchase of each lock. That means the Nuki Smart Lock is now more expensive up front at $199 (up from $159); however, the good news is that premium features are no longer behind a paywall. Those who already have Nuki Premium will also be able to continue using the premium features for the lifetime of the product without an added fee.

Additionally, Nuki offers an optional keypad, which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one with ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB) and NFC support.

Nuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.

Easy installOption of fingerprint keypadA year of battery life

Requires Wi-Fi bridgeKeypad is big and uglyNo support for Matter

Connectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (with plug-in module) / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad and fingerprint reader sold separately / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA alkaline batteries / Battery life: 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings

Starting at $130, the Yale Approach is a more affordable retrofit lock with no monthly subscription. It’s super easy to install, looks nice, and has a good list of features — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.

The Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. It has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.

The lock comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.

The bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home, but there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard Thread radio that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.

The optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button.

The keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.

My biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.

The Yale Assure 2 line — previously my top pick — has something for everyone. There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with Apple Home Key, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released a keypad version. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.

The Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door.

The lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.

Support for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a Z-Wave module for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, Ring Alarm, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this still hasn’t materialized. They have announced a different lock that uses Thread, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.

I tested the Wi-Fi module in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to Alexa Routines, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.

Support for Apple Home and Home KeyWorks over ThreadEasy-to-use keypadNice design options that may match your hardware

Connectivity: Wi-Fi or Thread / Access options: Key, keypad, app, voice, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Up to six months / Security Grade: ANSI Grade 1 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Apple Home Key, Amazon Alexa, Ring, and Google Home

Apple Home Key lets you use your iPhone or Apple Watch to tap to unlock your door in much the same way as you tap to pay. It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android.

Home Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as Apple has made it part of Matter). The Schlage Encode Plus is still the best option — if one of the most expensive — as it has a built-in keypad and works over Thread.

The keypad is useful for giving access to people with whom you can’t share a Home Key (sharing is quite limited), and Thread makes for a rock-solid connection. While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.

To use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly.

To allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app.

If you don’t want a smart lock that looks like a smart lock, there’s the Level Lock Pro. It doesn’t feature a chunky battery box or prominent branding, yet it packs a ton of technology inside the footprint of a traditional lock. The newer model features an upgraded processor, Matter-over-Thread support, a passive infrared sensor for presence detection, and a built-in door sensor to tell you if the door is open or closed, not just locked. It also comes in one of two discreet finishes, matte black or nickel, and offers up to a year of battery life with a single CR2.

In terms of execution, the faster dual-core Bluetooth/Thread chip delivers more reliable performance than earlier models — including our former pick, the Level Lock Plus — and the lock offers support for multiple access options. You can unlock the Lock Pro with a regular key, Apple Home Key, the Level app, voice control, auto-unlock, or a touch-to-unlock mode. We found the auto-unlock feature to be finicky at times, though, and the installation can be a headache on older doors. It’s also pricey, starting at $349 (plus an optional $79 Wi-Fi bridge).

That said, if you want a lock that offers premium features and a sleek design, the Lock Pro feels like the brand’s most fully realized vision of what a minimalist smart lock should be.

The Aqara U300 is a lever-style smart lock; it replaces a knob or lever lock on a door with a single borehole rather than a door with a deadbolt lock with two holes. This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.

There are options for smart lever locks from Yale, Schlage, and Lockly, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.

I installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.

It paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.

I love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.

The U300 is expensive at $230, but it’s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.

Eufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and video doorbell in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.

My favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it’s super handy.

The lock has another fairly unique feature: palm vein recognition technology. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.

Palm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.

The main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.

The 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.

There’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, including facial recognition, you need to connect it to a Eufy HomeBase.

Bear in mind, Matter integration only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock, Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread.)

Adding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.

At $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.

Connectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / Access options: Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: 10,000mAh rechargeable / Battery life: Eight months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home

I was very impressed with the Lockly Visage. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that’s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it’s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.

I was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.

There’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it’s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It’s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.

Note that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have a video doorbell version for $429, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.

Surprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.

Lockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other.

At $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.

Concerns about someone hacking your connected door lock are largely unfounded; it’s a lot easier to physically force a deadbolt lock or break a nearby window than it is to hack a smart lock. All residential door locks are rated for physical security by the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) standard, accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The deadbolt locks in this guide meet BHMA standards (retrofit locks aren’t rated, as it depends on the deadbolt they’re attached to). There are three levels: 1 is the highest, 3 is the lowest, and 2 is the norm for most residential locks. (You may also see letter grade ratings, a newer system introduced in 2021). Some “meet the standard” but aren’t accredited.

Most deadbolt locks are simple to install, requiring about 30 minutes and a screwdriver. If you have an older door, you may have to make some modifications, but smart locks are designed to be adjusted to suit standard doors.

Smart locks that work over built-in Wi-Fi will last 3 to 6 months. Those that use Bluetooth and have an optional plug-in module to connect to Wi-Fi will go 8 to 12 months. Those that rely just on Thread should last up to a year (I haven’t been able to test one for long enough to know for sure). Remember, if you have a lock that can use Thread and Wi-Fi (like the Schlage Encode Plus), Wi-Fi will drain the batteries quicker than Thread — so avoid activating the Wi-Fi if you can.

Most smart locks without a keyhole have some form of exterior power option to allow you to charge it enough to access the door when you’ve ignored the continuous warnings the app and lock have sent you to tell you the battery is running low. Most use a USB-C port to connect to a portable power bank, but some, like Yale, use a 9-volt battery to provide enough power to bring them back to life.

Auto unlock is a feature on several smart locks that uses a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi to determine where your phone is in relation to your front door and automatically unlock it for you as you approach. Your smartphone’s GPS determines your location, and Bluetooth then talks to your lock when you’re close enough, telling it to unlock. The lock will switch to away mode when GPS tells it you’ve left a radius around your home, and to back or home mode when you return. You do need to keep the lock manufacturer app open on your phone for this to work (it can run in the background).

Matter is a smart home standard designed to make connected devices more interoperable, reliable, secure, and easier to use. The benefit of a Matter smart lock now is future-proofing. Today, it doesn’t add much that most locks can’t already do (and, in some cases, less). But it means your lock should work with all the big smart home platforms in the future and will work with any Matter-compatible device now, such as smart plugs and smart lights, for home automation routines (for example, to shut off all your lights when you lock your door).A major benefit of a Matter lock is that you can share the lock across platforms without downloading additional apps, setting up accounts, or linking services through the cloud. This lets you use the same lock with Apple Home and Google Home, should you want, and you can control it with both voice assistants. The downside is that not all platforms support creating PIN codes for Matter smart locks with keypads (Google Home and Alexa don’t offer this yet). Additionally, Matter doesn’t support voice PIN codes, which platforms like Google Home use to authorize remotely unlocking door locks using smart speakers and smart displays.Matter locks with NFC that work directly with Matter (not through a bridge) can now support Apple Home Key through the Apple Home app (iPhone only).

If a lock uses Matter-over-Wi-Fi or connects through a bridge, you will need a Matter controller from the platform on which you want to use it — a HomePod or Apple TV for Apple Home, a Nest hub or smart speaker for Google Home.If the lock uses Matter-over-Thread, you will need a Matter controller and a Thread border router. These can be the same thing — a HomePod is both, and a Nest Hub Max is both. But the Thread border router doesn’t need to be platform-specific. So, if you have an Apple TV or an Eero Wi-Fi router that supports Thread and a smart speaker from Nest that’s a Matter controller — you could use a Thread lock over Matter in Google Home.

There’s a new standard coming to smart locks called Aliro. This is being developed by Apple, Samsung, and Google, along with major lock and chip manufacturers, to help smart locks integrate more seamlessly with smartphones. It is slated to have two main functions, UWB and NFC unlocking. UWB is a hands-free auto-unlock tech that uses a UWB radio in the lock and your phone to know when you’re approaching the door and automatically unlock it. NFC lets you tap your phone or watch to your lock to unlock it; it’s essentially Apple’s Home Key function, but not limited to iPhones, and Samsung and Google both plan to adopt it.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia. Read our story about why they’re provoking so much fury.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Massive structures, with thousands of specialized computer chips running in parallel to perform the complex calculations required by advanced AI models. A single facility can cover millions of square feet, built with millions of pounds of steel, aluminum, and concrete; feature hundreds of miles of wiring, connecting some hundreds of thousands of high-end GPU chips, and chewing through hundreds of megawatt-hours of electricity. These facilities run so hot from all that computing power that their cooling systems are triumphs of engineering complexity in themselves. But the star of the show are those chips with their advanced processors. A single chip in these vast arrays can cost upwards of $30,000. Racked together and working in concert, they process hundreds of thousands of tokens—the basic building blocks of an AI model—per second. Ooooomph.

Given the incredible amounts of capital that the world’s biggest companies have been pouring into building data centers you can make the case (and many people have) that their construction is single-handedly propping up the US stock market and the economy.

So important are they to our way of life that none other than the President of the United States himself, on his very first full day in office, stood side by side with the CEO of OpenAI to announce a $500 billion private investment in data center construction.

Truly, the hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota, where the good citizens of Sioux Falls hurled obscenities at their city councilmembers following a vote to permit a data center on the city’s northeastern side. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia.

So, let’s go to Georgia. The purplest of purple states. A state with both woke liberal cities and MAGA magnified suburbs and rural areas. The state of Stacey Abrams and Newt Gingrich. If there is one thing just about everyone there seemingly agrees on, it’s that they’ve had it with data centers.

Last year, the state’s Public Service Commission election became unexpectedly tight, and wound up delivering a stunning upset to incumbent Republican commissioners. Although there were likely shades of national politics at play (voters favored Democrats in an election cycle where many things went that party’s way), the central issue was skyrocketing power bills. And that power bill inflation was oft-attributed to a data center building boom rivaled only by Virginia’s.

This boom did not come out of the blue. At one point, Georgia wanted data centers. Or at least, its political leadership did. In 2018 the state’s General Assembly passed legislation that provided data centers with tax breaks for their computer systems and cooling infrastructure, more tax breaks for job creation, and even more tax breaks for property taxes. And then… boom!

But things have not played out the way the Assembly and other elected officials may have expected.

Journey with me now to Bolingbroke, Georgia. Not far outside of Atlanta, in Monroe County (population 27,954), county commissioners were considering rezoning 900 acres of land to make room for a new data center near the town of Bolingbroke (population 492). Data centers have been popping up all across the state, but especially in areas close to Atlanta. Public opinion is, often enough, irrelevant. In nearby Twiggs County, despite strong and organized opposition, officials decided to allow a 300-acre data center to move forward. But at a packed meeting to discuss the Bolingbroke plans, some 900 people showed up to voice near unanimous opposition to the proposed data center, according to Macon, Georgia’s The Telegraph. Seeing which way the wind had blown, the Monroe county commission shot it down in August last year.

The would-be developers of the proposed site had claimed it would bring in millions of dollars for the county. That it would be hidden from view. That it would “uphold the highest environmental standards.” That it would bring jobs and prosperity. Yet still, people came gunning for it.

Why!? Data centers have been around for years. So why does everyone hate them all of the sudden?

What is it about these engineering marvels that will allow us to build AI that will cure all diseases, bring unprecedented prosperity, and even cheat death (if you believe what the AI sellers are selling) that so infuriates their prospective neighbors?

There are some obvious reasons. First is just the speed and scale of their construction, which has had effects on power grids. No one likes to see their power bills go up. The rate hikes that so incensed Georgians come as monthly reminders that the eyesore in your backyard profits California billionaires at your expense, on your grid. In Wyoming, for example, a planned Meta data center will require more electricity than every household in the state, combined. To meet demand for power-hungry data centers, utilities are adding capacity to the grid. But although that added capacity may benefit tech companies, the cost is shared by local consumers.

Similarly, there are environmental concerns. To meet their electricity needs, data centers often turn to dirty forms of energy. xAI, for example, famously threw a bunch of polluting methane-powered generators at its data center in Memphis. While nuclear energy is oft-bandied about as a greener solution, traditional plants can take a decade or more to build; even new and more nimble reactors will take years to come online. In addition, data centers often require massive amounts of water. But the amount can vary widely depending on the facility, and is often shrouded in secrecy. (A number of states are attempting to require facilities to disclose water usage.)

A different type of environmental consequence of data centers is that they are noisy. A low, constant, machine hum. Not just sometimes, but always. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year. “A highway that never stops.”

And as to the jobs they bring to communities. Well, I have some bad news there too. Once construction ends, they tend to employ very few people, especially for such resource-intensive facilities.

These are all logical reasons to oppose data centers. But I suspect there is an additional, emotional one. And it echoes one we’ve heard before.

More than a decade ago, the large tech firms of Silicon Valley began operating buses to ferry workers to their campuses from San Francisco and other Bay Area cities. Like data centers, these buses used shared resources such as public roads without, people felt, paying their fair share. Protests erupted. But while the protests were certainly about shared resource use, they were also about something much bigger.

Tech companies, big and small, were transforming San Francisco. The early 2010s were a time of rapid gentrification in the city. And what’s more, the tech industry itself was transforming society. Smartphones were newly ubiquitous. The way we interacted with the world was fundamentally changing, and people were, for the most part, powerless to do anything about it. You couldn’t stop Google.

You could stand in front of it and block its path. You could yell at the people getting on it. You could yell at your elected officials and tell them to do something. And in San Francisco, people did. The buses were eventually regulated.

The data center pushback has a similar vibe. AI, we are told, is transforming society. It is suddenly everywhere. Even if you opt not to use ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, generative AI is  increasingly built into just about every app and service you likely use. People are worried AI will harvest jobs in the coming years. Or even kill us all. And for what? So far, the returns have certainly not lived up to the hype.

You can’t stop Google. But maybe, just maybe, you can stop a Google data center.

Then again, maybe not. The tech buses in San Francisco, though regulated, remain commonplace. And the city is more gentrified than ever. Meanwhile, in Monroe County, life goes on. In October, Google confirmed it had purchased 950 acres of land just off the interstate. It plans to build a data center there.

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.
