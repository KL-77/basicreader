            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <h2>Home Depot Deploys Havana-Style Sonic Weapon Against Day Laborers</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) are running up on migrant workers in Home Depot parking lots, the home improvement corporation has decided to take a stand — against the migrant workers.

Reporting by The Guardian reveals a cruel new initiative being rolled out to one high-traffic Home Depot location in Los Angeles’ Cypress Park: high-pitched noise machines meant to shoo away day laborers.

The Intituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California (Idepsca), an advocacy group for migrant workers, is calling for the removal of three sonic devices they say are causing migrant workers to suffer headaches and nausea.

In some areas, it’s common for day laborers to congregate outside home improvement stores like Home Depot, where they can find new gigs, catch rides to job sites, and quickly buy new equipment or material. It’s all part of the informal gig economy, a system which exploits poor and working class people for cheap labor.

Home Depot’s sound devices, advocates say, are punishing these folks at the bottom of the ladder.

“They chose to weaponize sound,” Los Angeles city councilwoman Eunisses Hernandes said at a conference. “Devices like these are used as torture against our people.”

One worker described to The Guardian how he has to wear ear plugs to block the excruciating noise, saying it “penetrates your bones.”

Hernandez also said that the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has begun using the devices on its property.

“This is the people’s land,” she said. “This is Caltrans land that is owned by Californians who pay taxes. The people’s land is being used to torture the people.”

The noise machine evokes tales of a mythic weapon supposedly responsible for the ailment known as “Havana syndrome,” which specifically seems to effect US intelligence officers stationed in Havana, Cuba.

No direct evidence of Cuba’s supposed sonic weapon has ever surfaced, though the Home Depot ear blasters do have another precedent: riot control weapons. In situations like the Ferguson uprising of 2014 or the Dakota Access Pipeline protest of 2016, police have deployed “sound cannons,” mobile arrays capable of incapacitating people with high-amplitude noise.

In other words, the same tactic has been refined from a tool of police control to a mechanism to protect corporate property. In both cases, sound is deployed as a weapon to repel unwanted people from a space, closing any chance for a dialogue.

The timing of the Home Depot deployment is significant, coming on the heels of a high number of brutal ICE raids in which Latino-looking workers are rounded up at random, stuffed into cars, and brought to deportation centers.

So far, Home Depot has been silent about the raids happening on its property. But given the chaos these agents cause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Home Depot is trying to wash its hands of the whole thing — “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”

WATCH: ICE agents jumped out of a rental truck and arrested 16 people outside of a Home Depot in Los Angeles as a part of what CBP calls “Operation Trojan Horse.” In a statement, Penske, the rental truck company ICE agents used during this raid, said the company was not made aware of the operation. #immigration #ice #la #losangeles

Asked for comment on the sonic warfare, Home Depot told The Guardian that the machines are a “safety initiative… intended to deter and prevent illegal overnight parking in the area,” with no connection to any “immigration enforcement.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have discovered an astonishing exoplanet that’s stretching our understanding of what’s possible for these distant worlds. And when we say say “stretch,” we mean it literally.

The roughly Jupiter-mass object, designated PSR J2322-2650b, orbits just one million miles away from its star, or one percent of the Earth’s distance from the Sun, with a single “year” lasting just 7.8 Earth hours. And at such proximity, the extreme gravity of the star — an exotic type known as a pulsar — pulls the entire planet into an oblong shape, like a lemon or a football.

The findings, published in a new study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are so unusual that the astronomers are having to consider if they represent an entirely new class of cosmic object.

“It’s the stretchiest planet that we’ve confirmed the stretchiness of,“ lead author Michael Zhang, an exoplanet scientist at the University of Chicago, told the New York Times.

The planet’s sun is a type of rapidly spinning neutron star. These are the almost impossibly dense stellar cores that are left over in the aftermath of a supernova, containing mass equal to our entire Sun in a package the size of a human city. (The resulting gravity is so extreme that if you could scoop just a tiny teaspoon of one of these objects without being instantly crushed into a soup of pure neutrons, which is what neutron stars are, it’d weigh trillions of pounds.)

Some of these neutron stars spin, becoming pulsars, and emit a sweeping beam of energy along its poles like a lighthouse, appearing to telescopes as a repeating signal.But since it emits mostly in gamma rays, it also means its light is invisible to telescopes like the James Webb, which see in infrared wavelengths. This provides a perfect opportunity to study an exoplanet, which are often outshined by the light of their star.

“This system is unique because we are able to view the planet illuminated by its host star, but not see the host star at all,” coauthor Maya Beleznay, a physicist at Stanford University, said in a NASA statement. “So we get a really pristine spectrum. And we can study this system in more detail than normal exoplanets.”

Their observations revealed that just as unusual as the planet’s lemon shape is the composition of its atmosphere. With surface temperatures up to 3,700 degrees Fahrenheit —which is four times hotter than Venus, the hottest world in the solar system — it’s almost entirely dominated by helium and carbon, something that’s never been seen before on any planet. That’s because molecular carbon easily binds with other elements commonly found on planets and especially gas giants, such as oxygen and nitrogen, suggesting that these elements must not be present.

With a weird composition comes deeply peculiar weather. The astronomers speculate that clouds of carbon soot float through the air. Near the core of the planet, these clouds can condense into shards of solid diamond.

As it stands, everything about PSR J2322-2650b is an enigma. Few pulsars are known to have a planet, let alone one that’s shaped like a lemon, has graphite for clouds, and lacks the elements detected on other worlds.

One possibility is that this configuration is actually a type of star system known as a black widow binary, in which the pulsar slowly siphons material from a smaller stellar object in its orbit, sucking the life out of it until it’s devoured completely.

But this has only been observed between a pulsar and another star, not a planet. That raises the possibility that the exoplanet is actually some kind of stellar remnant that’s already been whittled away at for eons. “It would have lost 99.9 percent of its mass, and we just happened to catch it right at the very end,” coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington told the NYT.

The more exciting alternative is that we’re witnessing an “entirely new type of object that we don’t have a name for,” Zhang suggested to the paper.

“Did this thing form like a normal planet? No, because the composition is entirely different. Did it form by stripping the outside of a star, like ‘normal’ black widow systems are formed? Probably not, because nuclear physics does not make pure carbon,” Zhang elaborated, via NASA. “It’s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism.”

            <h2>White House Confused by How Random YouTuber’s Stream Became Featured on Its Website</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The executive branch has been infiltrated by an unexpected entity: a random livestreamer.

On Friday, the White House said it was launching an investigation after some bearded dude’s YouTube stream suddenly showed up on its official website, Bloomberg reports, heightening the absurdity of our already tenuous reality.

The livestream was hosted by @RealMattMoney, who can be seen in a Bloomberg screenshot — see below — on the White House’s “Live News” section sitting at a typical streaming setup, and wearing gaming headphones and a dark gray t-shirt. An overlay shows his stream chat, where viewers praise his analysis. Beneath the video window, the stream’s title, displayed in elegant White House font, promises there will be “no mid-stream ads,” plus a little descriptor offering a $10 discount if you click a link for “StreamYard.”

The stream was visible on the “Live News” section of the official White House website shortly before midnight Thursday, appearing and disappearing for around an hour, according to Bloomberg‘s reporting.

RealMattMoney claims he had no idea about any of this.

“There’s no way this is real, right?” he tweeted Friday, responding to the reporting. “I was just trying to stream with my buddies.”

The video stream appeared to show a YouTuber, who describes himself as &quot;a shepherd for individual investors.&quot; Read more: https://t.co/6luLYBiyCH📷️: https://t.co/t99jnI2LNZ pic.twitter.com/AQTkCJzV65

While it seems mostly innocuous, the strange incident is bound to raise eyebrows given the Trump administration’s track record of cybersecurity gaffes, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth accidentally leaking secret bombing plans in an unsecure group chat.

@RealMattMoney, whose real name is Matt Farley, gives investor advice to his audience. When not in front of a webcam, he works as a petroleum engineer in Texas, and is a fan of president Trump, he told Bloomberg. “Had I known I would be on the White House page I would probably have dressed a little differently,” the 34-year-old added.

On his socials, he further lamented the missed opportunity to impress his dear leader, adding that he “would have had a different message than personal finance.”

As it stands, it’s not clear if Farley’s five minutes of fame was the result of a hack or an accidental post, per Bloomberg.

The year in transportation started with a couple of bankruptcies — Canoo and Nikola — and now it’s ending with two more. Rad Power Bikes is coming to an end — or at least a bankruptcy. The electric bike company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days.

And then there is troubled lidar maker Luminar, which also filed for bankruptcy this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation.

The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of layoffs, executive departures, and a legal fight with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter Sean O’Kane reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy.

Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed emerged. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026.

The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by Waymo’s fast-paced growth, although Zoox and Tesla have also started to set up shop. This next year could be when we see these companies really squaring off in the same markets; it will also be the year when companies will face even greater scrutiny over safety and how robotaxis fit into daily life.

Meanwhile, EVs have had their struggles this year and automakers have struggled to adjust.

For instance, Ford is pivoting yet again. The company said this week it is ending production of the fully-electric F-150 Lightning as part of a broader companywide shake-up that will put more emphasis on hybrids and gas-powered vehicles. As part of its shift, Ford is turning to the increasingly popular “extended range electric vehicle” version of the truck, which adds a gas generator that can recharge the battery pack to power the motors for over 700 miles. It’s also getting into the energy storage business — gotta do something with all those batteries — and says it is still committed to producing a midsized electric truck that will go on sale in 2027.

But hey, the EV is not dead. And the promise of smaller, more affordable ones are looming in the near distance with the imminent launch of Rivian’s R2 and Slate Auto’s electric truck.

Reporter Jagmeet Singh, who is based in India, always seems to have birds chirping in his ear about startup deals. The latest is Spinny, the Indian online marketplace for used cars.

Spinny is raising around $160 million, funds that will be used to acquire car services startup GoMechanic. TechCrunch learned the Series G round includes a mix of primary and secondary transactions and will value the 10-year-old startup at about $1.8 billion post-money.

Boatsetter and GetMyBoat, two companies that operate Airbnb-type business models for boats, agreed to merge.

Cowboy is back — sort of. The Brussels e-bike startup has been acquired by ReBirth Group Holding, a company that owns Gitane, Peugeot, and Solex. The e-bike startup had its buzzy moments but ultimately ran into problems, including a frame recall. The terms weren’t disclosed, but apparently it includes €15 million ($17.6 million) from existing shareholders.

Nirvana Insurance, an insurance tech startup focused on trucking, raised $100 million in a Series D funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. Lightspeed and General Catalyst also joined. Former TC reporter Mary Ann Azevedo had the scoop on the new valuation, which is now $1.5 billion.

Redwood launched a newly patented Battery Collection Bin designed to encourage consumers to recycle batteries. The system, which will launch in San Francisco, safely stores, packages, and monitors hundreds of batteries and battery-containing devices.

Rivian has added its branded “Universal Hands-Free” driving via a software update to its second-generation R1 EVs (not sure I am a fan of that term “universal hands-free,” btw). This upgrade will allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). Also in case you missed it over the weekend, senior reporter Sean O’Kane took us inside Rivian’s bet on AI-powered self-driving.

Securing America’s Future Energy has a new CEO. Avery Ash, SAFE’s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs and Special Initiatives, will become the organization’s next CEO.

Slate Auto, the electric truck startup backed by Jeff Bezos, said it has collected more than 150,000 refundable reservations for its low-cost EV due out at the end of 2026.

Sterling Anderson has been on the job at GM for six months and there is already chatter about him taking over as CEO once Mary Barra retires. My take: Anderson has big tasks ahead, so let’s all take a beat before assuming he’ll get that top post. GM president Mark Reuss is also in the wings.

Tesla has pulled its human safety monitors out of its robotaxis in Austin. The robotaxi service is limited with a fleet size numbering in the dozens. Still, it is a milestone. And for those wondering, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told me this week that Tesla has not applied for a driverless testing permit. The company only holds a permit to test autonomous vehicle technology with a human safety operator located behind the wheel.

Meanwhile, Tesla is facing a tricky situation in California. Here’s the gist: An administrative law judge agreed with the case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and ruled Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software. The DMV wanted to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its action, and a judge has agreed.

Ah, but wait. The DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to comply. That gives Tesla two options if it wants to keep those licenses: drop the Autopilot name or ship software to its cars that make them autonomous.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-as-robotaxis-stall-during-blackout/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets.

Numerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled at roads and intersections as human drivers either passed them by or were stuck behind them.

Waymo said on Saturday that it had temporarily suspended service in the city due to the blackout. Spokesperson Suzanne Philion provided a similar statement to TechCrunch on Sunday morning.

“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,” Philion said. “Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials to monitor infrastructure stability, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon. We appreciate your patience and will provide further updates as soon as they are available.”

The company did not provide an explanation for why the blackout had such a dramatic effect on its vehicles. One possible culprit: The blackout took down many of the city’s traffic lights. (In fact, with the blackout affecting both lights and Muni mass transit, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warned residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.)

Others theorized that Waymo might have been affected by an interruption in cell service or traffic data.

The blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.

A letter from Tiger Global Management leaked earlier this month said that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/as-eu-waters-down-2035-ev-goals-electric-startups-express-concern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.

Instead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader ‘Automotive Package‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.

If the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.

“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”

Douglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.

Their appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.

Even within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”

Unlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.

Issam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”

To be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.

The plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”

Still, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.

Already, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.

Another uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.

The debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s about a five-hour drive from Akron to South Bend. Things get a little tricky on the outskirts of Cleveland, but after that you just stick to I-80. I stopped for gas and a Subway sandwich and reached my brother’s apartment around two in the afternoon. He lived in an old hotel, which had been dolled up and turned into residential units. This was part of a compromise with his wife, who didn’t like the thought of their kids living downtown (in South Bend! that hub of degenerate America), so after they separated, he picked a supervised building to calm her down. But it meant he could only afford a two-bedroom; both girls had to sleep in one room. I had never been there before.

I don’t see my brother often but whenever I’m about to … I feel this onrush of eagerness. All day it came in waves, as the miles strung out behind me. The highway takes you north of the city, and I turned off and drove past Notre Dame, then nosed along, following my phone and staring out the window at every stoplight. South Bend is pretty wide open. The river is like another blue highway between roads. There are public gardens on street corners and low-rise banks and apartment blocks. It’s funny to think, we grew up in the same house, but this is where he made his life.

The Hoffman is opposite a Burger King, where I left the car. Later I had to move it underground—his apartment comes with visitor parking.

Eric’s working day is unpredictable. Sometimes he’s in the office, but he also spends a lot of time visiting schools, not just in South Bend but across St. Joseph County. When I spoke to him on the phone, he promised to leave a key with the super. It took me a while, but I found the super and got the key and let myself into his empty home, which was on the sixth floor and had a view of the river from the kitchenette. But the whole place still felt like a hotel, the carpeting, the furniture, the pillar holding up the living room, the windows that you couldn’t open. At least the girls’ room had toys on the floor and pictures on the wall—kid pictures in crayon and watercolor, stuck on with Blu Tack. What was nice about the apartment was that you got the feeling he didn’t care what it looked like to other adults, but that was also a little depressing.

I left my backpack on the floor and lay down for a minute in one of the bottom bunks. When I woke up, Eric was leaning over me. The curtains were closed; it was still sunny outside, and the glow of the afternoon came through in dusty lines.

“I didn’t know if I should wake you. It’s after five.”

“Hey.” Then I said, “That’s all right. I didn’t sleep much last night. It’s nice to see you.”

Eric and I are six years apart, the same age gap as my children. Whether you want to or not, you end up reproducing the structure of your childhood. In Eric’s case, that meant he didn’t really remember our father, I mean, remember him as somebody who lived with us. The guy we spent two weeks in the summer with, in his house in Orange County, where he had another two kids, much younger, and a new wife, and basically didn’t want us around … that guy, Eric knew well. But the other guy, on his first marriage, when Dad still thought, Maybe I can live a life where I haven’t made any unforgivable mistakes, where whatever we’re going through is just the normal headache—he didn’t remember him.

When Dad left, Eric started sleeping in Mom’s bed. Because he kept waking up with nightmares, she said, but really because she didn’t want to sleep alone. This was tricky, because Eric still wet the bed. Even at 7 years old; he had a bladder problem, and eventually my parents bought rubber sheets for him, so Mom didn’t have to keep washing his bedclothes. But when he started sleeping with her, the same thing happened. I was old enough to help with the household chores, which included laundry. So sometimes I had to deal with their wet sheets. Every night she put him to sleep in his bed, and then, when she went up a few hours later, carried him to her room. They had a relationship from which I was basically excluded, not that I really wanted any part of it. Eric had to absorb a lot of her craziness and unspent love.

The truth about Dad was, he didn’t like small kids. He just didn’t like them, which made it ironic that when he started an affair with Lisa, who was 20 years younger and worked in the L.A. office, he eventually moved in with her and had two more kids. But he didn’t mind teenagers, and that’s what I was when he left. He taught me how to play cards, not just basic poker, but old-school games like casino and bridge. He had a funny way of laying down a winning card. He didn’t say anything, but just set it down a little heavily, so you noticed. He could shuffle a deck in mid-air, which I spent hours practicing. Sometimes, on Saturday afternoons, he took me and Eric to Phillies games, but since Eric got carsick and generally made himself a pain in the neck, eventually he just took me. When he left, it was harder for me to say, the guy’s a jerk. Not that this was Eric’s point of view, but there wasn’t a big gap in his life after Dad walked out, as there was in mine.

It probably sounds like I resented my kid brother, which wasn’t the case. I felt sorry for him and guilty about him. He was one of those kids who always gets what he wants and isn’t happy about it. For one thing, he was a very fat kid until he hit puberty. I mean, fat enough that it was an impediment to certain activities. If I tried to talk to Mom about it, she just got stressed out. It was one more thing going wrong in her life. And she couldn’t say no to him, anyway, if he wanted soda for supper or another bowl of mint chocolate chip. Part of why I went to Pomona was to get the hell out of New Jersey; also, maybe, because I thought I might see more of my dad. But that didn’t really happen. Even though the campus is less than an hour’s drive from Newport Beach, maybe I saw him five or six times in the whole four years. But I didn’t know that when I went.

I felt bad about Eric, though, I really did. Leaving him alone with our mother, when she was in that state.

But he turned himself around. He lost a lot of weight. When I flew home the summer after freshman year, I almost didn’t recognize him. He used adolescence as a chance to make certain decisions about himself, and who he wanted to become. So, no to all the cookies and Cokes, which my mother found hard to take—it was like a rejection of her love. He never liked sports but started jogging in the mornings and lifting weights after school. Even as a fat kid, he’d had a kind of social confidence, he didn’t mind attracting attention, which he found ways of putting to good use. At some point I came home to a world in which my dumb kid brother was the star of the school play and reading Walker Percy on the pot, so you couldn’t get him out of the bathroom.

All of this came at a price, and not just for Mom. Somehow he didn’t seem comfortable with this new identity in front of me. For example, he’d made Mom join a church, St. Hedwig on Brunswick Avenue, just to get her out of the house, he said, so she could meet new people. But I think he also liked the idea of having a mission and a community, neither of which I’ve ever been a big fan of. So on Sunday mornings over the holidays I had to decide: Do I go along or not? Eric made it pretty clear, essentially saying to me, I don’t expect you to follow this new direction our lives have taken, which was reasonable of him. But I think he also meant, Leave us alone. So I left them alone. On the whole I was grateful that he’d found a way to turn his unhappy energy outward, even if it meant I didn’t get to play big brother. That’s fine, that’s okay, I mean, for eight months a year he was on his own. He couldn’t rely on his big brother very much.

Still, every time I was about to see him, I felt this rush of childish eagerness clutching my heart, which was replaced, when I did see him, with something more complicated. A feeling like, we both have to protect ourselves against this level of intimacy.

He wanted to know how long I planned to stay, if I could stick around and see the girls, who came after school every Wednesday. But I told him, “I’m leaving tomorrow. I have to get to Denver.”

“To see Brian Palmetto. But that’s a longer conversation; it can wait.”

I sat in his living-room area, on one of the low couches. He made me a cup of Celestial Seasonings. “What do you want to do?” he asked.

He took off his shoes and stood on the thick carpet in his socks. Because of all those years of acting, he had good physical balance; he moved like an athlete. He also looked too skinny, if you ask me.

“We can drive around, I wouldn’t mind seeing the city.”

So that’s what we did, but first I had to move my car from the Burger King into one of the Hoffman’s visitor parking spots. So we got in my car, then we got in his car. Eric drove an old Camry. It was basically his office, he spent a lot of time on the road. There were papers on the passenger seat, which he told me to throw in the back. “You see how I live,” he said. But it pleased him, I think, to sit behind the wheel; it made the power relationship a bit easier.

We drove across the river to the girls’ school, which took up several blocks behind a spear-topped iron fence. “That’s where all my money goes,” he said. You couldn’t see much. There were trees in the way, and wide lawns, and vague collegiate-looking buildings in the distance. We parked for a minute on the other side of the street, in front of somebody’s house. It was 6 o’clock. People were coming home after a working day, and we watched a couple of cars pull out of the long school drive.

“But the girls are happy,” he said. “At least at school.”

“More or less. Officially nondenominational. It’s where Terry went. They’re basically having her childhood … without the father.” He laughed; he had a sweet, unhappy laugh. Eric, unlike me, had lost most of his hair and cut what was left pretty short, so he looked like a monk or a long-distance runner. To me, he still looked like a kid, boyish and somewhat intense, but I realized that if I met him now I’d think, a middle-aged man.

“Maybe you could call and say their uncle’s in town.”

“I’ve learned it’s better if you stick to the script.”

Terry and the kids lived in Granger, about 20 minutes away, by the Michigan border. But first he took me past her parents’ place, which isn’t the house she grew up in but where they moved after retiring. It was on a cul-de-sac with a circular drive at the end, which was around a patch of green lawn with a flagpole sticking out of it and an American flag flapping around on the pole. “Can you believe it?” Eric said. “You couldn’t make it up. Thirty years ago, none of this was here, this wasn’t even a place.”

“Who? Terry’s parents? I don’t know. I can’t describe them and sound like a sane person. We go to the same church.”

“I didn’t know you went to church anymore.”

“Sometimes I take the girls.” He was circling the flagpole. Eventually he said, “They still introduce me to people as their son-in-law.”

In Granger, there were no other cars, the streets were wide and curbless. Most of the houses had extensive lawns, and sometimes at the end of a block, there was open grassland, dotted with trees, so you couldn’t always tell where one yard began and another left off. “That’s it,” Eric said, slowing down. “With the Honda in the driveway.” In fact, all you could see of their house was the gray metal door of the garage.

We turned a corner but the rest of it was screened by trees. I had a slightly creepy feeling of déjà vu.

“I can’t remember how long you lived there.”

“Three years. First we had an apartment in Edgewater. Then we moved out here. I actually have a job offer in Chicago, but if I take it, I’ll never see the girls. Except maybe like Dad, for two weeks in the summer. I don’t know. We can park and get out, nobody will see us.”

He pulled over by the side of the road, but we just sat there, under the trees. Eric turned off the engine.

“About 10 years ago, she had an affair with a guy from … our synagogue. I told myself, when Miri leaves home, then I can go, too.”

One of the downstairs lights in the house came on; dusk was setting in. Eric said, “That’s the bathroom light.”

“I forgot to give them to you, but I bought a few things for the kids.”

“Mostly candy, but I got them a Frisbee, too. In case they didn’t have one already. I don’t know.”

“That’s nice.” Then he said, “Terry always drives them to her parents’ house. It’s a 10-minute walk but she always takes the car. She won’t even let the girls bike over there.”

“Traffic,” he said. We sat in the dark car by the side of an empty street. “She lives in a world of fear. I couldn’t take it anymore.”

“The apartment isn’t really a place I want to be in the evening, if the girls aren’t there. So I drive around.”

“Listen,” I said. “I need to cut loose a little. Is there somewhere we can get a beer?”

So that’s what we did. He turned on the engine and we drove into Edgewater, his old neighborhood. Nothing seemed very far away in South Bend, it’s a shrinking city. We went to a place called Kelly’s, where it was easy to park. Just a small windowless building on the corner of a large lot. I said to Eric as we walked in, “Can you eat here?” and he said, “You can eat.” There was a pool table at the back, and a couple were playing pool. But other than that, it was fairly empty, it was Monday night. Just some people at the curved bar—guys in trucker hats and women in shorts.

“I come here because Terry never would,” Eric said. “They had a big shooting outside a few years ago.”

We sat down near the pool table; a waitress came over. I ordered a French-dip sandwich and an IPA with a stupid name. Eric went for the fish basket. We had a couple of pints before the food arrived. One of the things I forgot about my brother is that he giggles when he drinks, he gets happy pretty fast, until it turns into something else. We watched the people playing pool, the girl was better than the guy. He wore a Fincher Landscaping shirt, short-sleeved with a collar, and looked about 25. She was older, late 30s, early 40s, on the heavy side but well made-up, with straight dyed-black hair and bright-red lipstick. A little Goth-y, but, like, now she had a job.

Maybe they weren’t a couple, but he kept trying to flirt with her. He said, “Play me again. I gotcha this time, I’m just screwing around. Oh come on.” He kept putting quarters on the table.

“Terry says I have anger issues, but I think what I need to deal with is the stuff that makes me angry, that’s what I need to deal with.” Everything seemed funny to Eric. “I don’t know, I’m working on regulating my moods. Regulating my moods.” He repeated himself, too.

“The company I work for has headquarters in Evanston. It’s a step up the ladder, but it means not going into schools anymore. It’s a lot more money.”

“I don’t know. I need to do something different. But it’s not, like, back in college, I dreamed of working for an educational charity.” That made him laugh, too.

“Nobody ends up doing what they wanted to do.”

“Didn’t I sell you a house on Carroll Street?” It was the woman at the pool table; she was talking to me. “Come on, help me out here,” she said. Fincher Landscaping was looking over at us. He had soft brown hair like a loose shower cap, I don’t know why this image occurred to me. He was about 6 foot 4. “You had a little girl,” she went on. “I didn’t think the marriage would last.”

“I’m just messing with you. How old is she now?” She rested her cue against the wall, which was covered in seven-inch singles around a framed Milwaukee Brewers Robin Yount jersey.

“Eighteen. I just dropped her off at college.”

“I think you’ve got me mixed up with someone else.”

“Help me out here,” she said again. “Want to shoot some pool?”

So the three of us ended up playing cutthroat. I mean, my brother and me and this woman, Sharon Donnegan—that’s how she introduced herself. She worked for Wayman Realtors. Fincher tried to argue with her but she said, “I’m sorry, I ran into some friends,” and eventually he went over to the bar and watched us from there.

Eric never had much hand-eye coordination, that was one area of childhood he left to me. Even as a teenager, when he got in shape, he was a get-in-shape kind of kid and not really into sports. Sharon and I were roughly on the same level, but she won the first two games, which gave Eric a lot of joy. He was drunk enough that he said things like, Look at you, getting beat by a girl, which he wouldn’t have said sober. But he also liked calling her a girl, I think he thought it sounded flattering or flirtatious. “Where’d you learn to play like that?” he said, and she said, “My dad was in the Air Force. Every base had a table.”

I felt bad for Eric, I didn’t think she was interested. When he missed a shot, he asked her what he was doing wrong. “Your back stroke is all over the place,” she said, and he said, “Show me.”

The waitress came and he ordered three more beers. I told him, somebody’s got to drive us home, I don’t mind drinking Coke. And Sharon wanted a hard seltzer.

In the end, she took over the order, because Eric was having trouble making himself understood. He wasn’t that drunk but he was trying to manage too many interactions at once. So he had another IPA, and I had a Coke, and she had a Vizzy. It was about 10 o’clock at night, I’d been in the car all day, I wanted to go home—or at least, to my kid brother’s rented apartment, where I could sleep in my niece’s bottom bunk. Eric said we need to play again, to maintain the honor of the Layward brothers.

“Are you guys brothers? You don’t look alike,” Sharon said.

“He’s a lot older than me, he let himself go.”

I think Sharon liked me; it’s awkward to write this, but she gave me that impression. And maybe that’s why, when Eric said, “Show me,” she finally said, “All right, line one up,” and stood behind him with her hips against his ass and her hand on his elbow and slowly guided his cue. While giving me a look, maybe she wanted to make me jealous, I don’t know. Stir up some kind of fraternal rivalry for her attentions. I couldn’t tell if Eric was having a good night, letting off steam, or just descending deeper into unhappiness. He kept wanting to use my phone.

“You don’t carry a phone? It’s not like a gun.”

But he borrowed mine and started taking pictures—mostly of Sharon, bending down over the table. I won the third game. “So what are you doing here?” she said, when Eric went to the bathroom.

“I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing. Seeing my brother.”

He was in the bathroom a long time. “You want another drink, or you want to go somewhere else?” she said. For a second I wondered what it would be like. She had a pale face, which the lipstick made look even paler, and I could see, when I stood next to her, the soft white skin of her scalp between the grains of her hair. She was younger than Amy and obviously less attractive, but you got an energy from her, like she was still interested in what might happen next, which I didn’t get from Amy anymore.

But that’s what I suggested, when he came out of the bathroom. He looked pretty pale himself, he didn’t look good. But he didn’t want to go home. He said, “We can’t abandon Sharon to the vicissitudes,” in one of his theatrical voices. I don’t know who he was channeling. Some English actor. “You’ve got a pretty good accent,” Sharon said. “My mother is actually Scottish, at least, that’s where she was born.”

He tried a Scottish accent, but it wasn’t really coming.

“You go, I’ll stick around with … Sharon. We’re having a good time. Everybody knows how to have a good time except you.”

“I don’t think she wants you to stick around.”

She looked at him, she looked at me. It was a Monday night in Kelly’s Bar, she probably had work in the morning. I don’t know who goes out on Monday night, or why.

“I think I should probably head out, too,” she said. “I just need to use …” and she did a little curtsy, “… the ladies’ room.”

In the parking lot, we had an argument about who should drive. I’d had two or three beers, Eric probably had a couple more. They affected him more than they affected me, he was a very skinny, very nervy person. Eventually Eric gave me the keys but he wanted to wait until Sharon came out, to make sure she was okay.

“Don’t you feel a little creepy,” I said, but we waited a minute and then drove home.

The drive was only five minutes, we probably should have walked. Maybe it would have sobered Eric up. As soon as we started, his mood fell off a cliff. He sat hugging himself against the seat belt and looking out the window. I didn’t actually know the way, I kept saying, you have to tell me where to go. We crossed over the river and I tried to follow it into town. He said, “You didn’t have to put her on the spot like that.”

“So why’d she ask us to play?” After a minute he said, “You always think women are hitting on you.”

“You were always like that, even when we were kids. You always thought, other people were embarrassed by us.”

By us I guess he meant him and Mom. “That’s not true at all.” But I don’t know, maybe it was. He was 12 years old when I left for college, I didn’t really know him as anything other than a fat little kid. He was always whining about something; I felt bad for him. He just wanted and wanted and didn’t get, until Mom gave in. Sometimes I tried to redirect the conversation from their constant interplay. I tried to get Mom to teach him self-restraint. But he didn’t change until I left.

All that was 35 years ago. At a certain point with these family dynamics, you’d think the statute of limitations would run out.

We parked in the underground garage, which had an elevator. It was almost midnight, we were almost talked out. Back in his apartment, he said, “Do you need me to change the sheets? They’re pretty clean. Anyway, you already slept in them.”

“No, that’s fine. Hey, it’s nice to see you.”

“I’m sorry if I got it wrong tonight. I’m getting a lot of things wrong right now.”

We were in the girls’ bedroom. He sat down on one of the small chairs.

“I don’t meet many women these days. I’m spending a lot of time in my own head.”

“They’ll be all right. We were all right.”

“You turned into a totally different person. You got your shit together. I can’t tell you … how impressed I was, every time I came home. I thought, If he can do that to himself, he can … he’ll be fine.”

He looked at me with tears in his eyes. “I just miss having a woman in my life. I miss having somebody to be nice to.”

“That’s pretty much my only function right now.”

But I didn’t know what else to say. He let me use the bathroom first, and then I lay in bed with the lights off and listened to him moving around. Eric warned me he wasn’t much of a sleeper, he watched a lot of TV.

Lying there, in the kids’ bed, with the top bunk crowding down on me, I remembered something my dad once did. When I was about 12 years old, he took me out to Cadwalader Park to have a sex talk. We had just moved to Trenton, I thought he wanted to show me the neighborhood. But he explained about wet dreams, we talked about masturbation. Everything you think or want turns out to be normal, don’t worry about that, he said. I was 12, none of these biological changes meant much to me. Look, this is just a stage you have to go through. I’m sorry about it but there’s nothing you can do. You just have to go through it. I tried to concentrate on my jump shot. If I missed, at least it gave me a minute to chase down the ball.

I’ll give you some free advice, which you’re not going to listen to, my dad said. But I listened. At some point you have to learn to control the sex urge, otherwise you let yourself get bossed around.

Who was he talking to? Me? Two years later, he ran off to California and started a second family with the woman from the L.A. office. Maybe he had already been having an affair.

He died in February 2020, just before everything shut down. Complications from diabetes; I don’t really know what he died from. He had a stroke, then he went to the hospital and never came out. I always thought he looked after himself pretty well, for a man of his generation; his wife was somebody you could trust to be on top of things, medically. Despite the way he left us, he was basically a conservative person, always trying to protect himself against things going wrong. Walking out on Mom was the one big romantic gesture of his life.

Eric and I shared a hotel room, none of our wives or kids came to the funeral. We stayed at the Ramada, just off Route 55 and about 10 blocks from the beach.

It was a very alienating experience. Everybody else at the funeral—he was cremated and half his ashes were scattered off a boat deck into the Pacific—belonged to his California life, his second life. (Later they erected a gravestone in Pacific View Memorial Park, where Kobe Bryant is also buried, but that was after we left.) We had two half sisters we barely knew, who were now 30-something women and much closer to Dad than we ever were. The younger one, Sammy, wore a Philadelphia Eagles hard hat to the ceremony, the kind where you can strap a couple cans of beer or soda to the ear holes and drink them through a crazy straw without moving your head. It seemed inappropriate to me, Eric was very upset. It turned out Sammy had given Dad the hat for his birthday; he still rooted for Philadelphia sports teams and used to wear it in front of the TV on Sunday afternoons.

“He didn’t really fill it up, it was just for shits and giggles.”

“I didn’t even know he was a football fan.”

“Oh he loved the Eagles, he watched every game.”

She was the kind of person who is determined to have a good time at a funeral, because it’s supposed to be a celebration of a happy life. Even if I had no personal connection to her, I don’t think I would have liked her.

Because of jet lag, Eric and I woke up early after the funeral. Maybe we were both hungover. The heavy hotel curtains made it hard to tell the time of day. Eventually I got up (my bed was nearer the window) and pulled them back. So from about half past four we watched the California light slowly grade into morning. The traffic noise increased. We dozed a little, I looked at my phone. It was a long night. Eric said, “From their point of view, I don’t think we ever really existed.” And I told him, which I probably shouldn’t have, the story of those last few weeks before Dad walked out.

“He told me he was going,” I said. “He wanted to tell you, but you were too little, he thought you might tell Mom.”

“I don’t know, I don’t remember. But I’ll tell you a terrible thing, I felt excited for him. He was very excited, that’s why he told me. He couldn’t keep it a secret anymore, from all of us. He had to tell someone. Maybe I was just excited because it was me. I was 14 years old. It just seemed like … one of those glimpses of adult life, which at that age … I wanted to know what was really going on. That’s how it felt to me, but I also don’t think … I didn’t think he’d actually do it. When he left I was so ashamed, I couldn’t even look at Mom. She thought I was upset because of Dad but really I just felt guilty. Have I told you this before? I don’t think I’ve told anyone, except Jill.”

“No, you didn’t tell me. I’m sorry,” Eric said.

“That you had to deal with all that, it wasn’t fair.”

It’s not what I expected him to say. I thought he’d be mad or jealous.

“I don’t know. It just seemed like one of those things you tell your college girlfriend.”

We had different flights out—I was going to JFK from LAX, he’d flown into John Wayne. They had direct flights to Chicago, where he’d left the car. After that it was just a two-hour drive to South Bend. We had breakfast together in the hotel restaurant, then got different cabs. That was the last time I’d seen him, before now.

In the morning, I could tell the atmosphere had shifted. Whatever window of communication had opened up between us had closed again. It was just another working day, he liked to leave the house by 8 o’clock. I was still in boxer shorts when I walked in.

He was making coffee in the kitchenette. The toaster popped.

“I don’t know. It’s just something that started happening.”

I guessed he meant my face, which was swollen and leaking water through the eyes—I had to squeeze them just to see.

“Eventually. They ran a lot of tests. I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”

“You need to do something.” He felt happier, showing his concern.

I drank some of the coffee he’d made and put another waffle in the toaster. There were a couple of stools under the kitchen counter. If you sat with your back against it, you could see the river. Funny how the eye is drawn to water—it’s just a very flat part of the view. But the surface shifts a little, slowly. Eric had disappeared into the bathroom. When he came out again, he looked like one of those people you meet whose job is to be friendly and helpful. With his pale, almost clean-shaven head, and his Adam’s apple sticking out.

He stood in the living-room area, and I got up to hug him but stopped a little short—he carried a messenger bag across his chest.

“Just close the door behind you,” he said. “Are you coming back this way?”

“After Denver … presumably you’ve got to get the car back to New York.”

“I haven’t really thought that far in advance.”

“Well, if you do, you know where I live.”

“It’s good to see you, Eric. I hate to … I don’t know, I hate all the distances.”

“Where should I put the presents for the girls?”

“Just leave them in their room. If it’s candy their mother won’t like it, but that’s her problem.”

I wanted to say something else but didn’t know what.

After he left, I loaded the breakfast things in the dishwasher and showered. There were rubber letters stuck to the side of the tub. Then I stripped the bed and packed my backpack and left.

Driving out, I followed my phone for a while, but then, outside Waterford, I stopped for gas and turned it off. The route was pretty much just a straight shot west. I was thinking about Eric but at some point realized that I was talking to Amy about him. The whole time I felt like I was in communication with her. She said, How’s your brother, and I said, Not great. We went out to some bar and he got drunk. There was a pool table and we started playing pool with some woman. Eric got a little … he was very attentive, which I don’t think was appreciated. I didn’t like seeing that.

It’s fine, right? He’s single … he’s allowed to try.

No, but it feeds into this whole dynamic we used to have, where I was …

What? What were you? Did she want you instead?

I don’t know and I don’t really care; she wasn’t important. I’m just worried about Eric.

You worry because it makes you feel better about yourself. You always have to be the responsible one.

That’s not fair, that’s not true. I mean … look at me now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last July, while on his way to his job as a security guard at a cannabis farm in California, George Retes was tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, and arrested by federal agents conducting an immigration raid. The agents ignored the license plate on Retes’s car and the sticker on his windshield, both of which identified him as a U.S. Army veteran, and did not even bother to determine whether he was a citizen before strip-searching him and locking him up in a cell. Retes was detained overnight without any opportunity to call a lawyer or his family.

“No one deserves to be treated like this,” Retes told this magazine after his release. “To have no rights. It’s just crazy to think about—that they can just mask up and take someone off the street, no questions asked, and you’re just gone.”

Read: A U.S. citizen detained by ICE for three days tells his story

Retes is one of an estimated 170 American citizens who have been detained by federal immigration agents as part of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation campaign, according to ProPublica, which warns that the count is both incomplete and unofficial because the federal government is not documenting its own abuses of power. At least 20 of those citizens, ProPublica found, had been detained overnight and incommunicado—a violation of their constitutional rights. When questioned about these detentions, Trump-administration officials claimed that the citizens had assaulted federal agents—an assertion proved false in many cases by video evidence or an inability by the government to produce serious charges reflecting the accusations. (One thrown sandwich hardly counts.)

Across the country, federal agents are flagrantly and casually disregarding Americans’ due-process rights. And they have been remarkably forthright about how they choose their victims. As Gregory Bovino, a top Border Patrol commander, told a white reporter: Agents were arresting people based on “the particular characteristics of an individual—how they look. How do they look compared to, say, you?”

In Memphis, Reggie Williams told ProPublica that he was instructed by federal agents to keep his ID on him going forward, as though Black residents of the city were emancipated slaves forced to carry freedom papers lest they be kidnapped and returned to bondage. Bovino said basically the same thing after federal agents assaulted a Somali American citizen and refused to free him for hours despite his offers to show them a photo of his passport on his phone: “One must carry immigration documents,” Bovino posted on X. In Chicago, Maria Greeley was zip-tied by federal agents coming off a double shift at the bar where she worked. She had her passport and showed it to them, and still they detained her because, she said, she did not “look like” a Greeley.

This is racial profiling. And the Supreme Court has declined to stop it.

In September, an emergency docket decision effectively permitted this racial profiling by lifting a court order preventing it. “The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a lone concurrence. Although “apparent ethnicity alone” isn’t enough to detain someone, it can be a “relevant factor,” he continued. “Under this Court’s precedents, not to mention common sense, those circumstances taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

What this means in practice is that if you are not white, you cannot go certain places without the risk of being kidnapped by federal agents. That is not “common sense”; it is the nullification of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal rights under the law.

This decision is only one of the ways that the Court, under Chief Justice John Roberts, has been chipping away at the parts of the Constitution dedicated to ensuring equal citizenship to all through rulings on voting rights, immigration, and equal protection. It has done this even as it insists—while striking down affirmative action and school-integration programs—that the Constitution is “colorblind.”

The Constitution of the Roberts Court is not color-blind. It is a Constitution that permits discrimination on the basis of race, but forbids alleviating discrimination on the basis of race. And over the next year, the Court will face more cases that could further erode both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, pushing America back toward what some on the right believe is the true, Antebellum Constitution.

The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments make up the Civil War and Reconstruction amendments. The Thirteenth abolished slavery except as punishment for a crime, but America needed to do more to prevent the resurgence of the slave-owning South’s caste-based society. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments enshrined in the Constitution principles of universal male suffrage, nondiscrimination, and nonracial (birthright) citizenship. Although imperfect—the vote for women was not included—they were a crucial first step toward ensuring that the rights conferred by American citizenship would remain inviolate no matter where you were, and no matter who you were.

After the Reconstruction period following the Civil War, the Supreme Court essentially voided the meaning of these amendments. The post-Reconstruction Court helped pave the way for Jim Crow, showering most of the rights reserved for the emancipated on corporations, allowing states to disenfranchise their Black populations through superficially “color-blind” means, and permitting racial discrimination by both government entities and private actors. The amendments were resurrected during the civil-rights movement, but they are now under assault for a second time by both the Court and an executive branch that is distorting or refusing to enforce antidiscrimination laws about housing, voting, and employment.

A faction of conservatives has never stopped this campaign. As soon as the Reconstruction amendments were passed, people argued that they were illegitimate, a betrayal of the original document—a “rape of the Constitution” as the columnist Frank Meyer wrote in 1964 about Brown v. Board of Education in National Review. In 1965, that magazine published a cover story arguing that the Voting Rights Act, by enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment, would effectively “repeal the Constitution to give the Negro the vote.” During the Reagan administration, a young attorney in the Justice Department named John Roberts fought to weaken the law. Originalism, the author Madiba K. Dennie points out, is a convenient vehicle for this project because it prioritizes interpretations from historical periods where women and Black people were excluded from the political process.

In more recent years, the slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk complained that the Fourteenth Amendment was a “Marxist revolutionary gateway” for everything the left wanted to push through. The more genteel conservative writer Christopher Caldwell argued that the entire post-civil-rights-movement Constitution was a “rival” to the “constitution of 1788, with all the traditional forms of jurisprudential legitimacy and centuries of American culture behind it.”

Roberts’s Court likes to invoke history and tradition, but some justices are perfectly happy to ignore the express intent of the Founders—such as the fundamental belief that the Constitution is meant to change—to further an ideological project. The Roberts Court’s repeated rewriting of the Constitution on Trump’s behalf reveals the antebellum Constitution they envision to be a fraud, a gauzy nostalgia based on the Founders’ worst impulses as slavers and hypocrites. This is an attempt to turn the guarantees of the Civil War amendments back into what James Madison called “parchment barriers,” their meaning perverted to ensure the protection of the strong instead of the weak.

Since 2007, when Roberts struck down a school-integration program while stating that “the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” the right-wing majority has followed the philosophy that there’s no discrimination if you pretend it isn’t happening. Although the Fifteenth Amendment states clearly that the right to vote cannot be “denied or abridged” on the basis of “race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” the Roberts Court has acted as though the only true discrimination is against the right to discriminate.

In 2013, the Court effectively nullified a requirement in the 1965 Voting Rights Act that forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to “preclear” their voting-rule changes with the Justice Department. The majority ignored the express language of the Fifteenth Amendment in doing so, and Roberts relied on a doctrine that “all States enjoy equal sovereignty,” a phrase that exists nowhere in the Constitution but was invoked by Chief Justice Roger Taney in the infamous Dred Scott decision: Taney argued that letting Black people be citizens would violate the sovereignty of the slave states. Prohibiting states from passing discriminatory voting measures was a form of discrimination—against states, which matter, not against Black people, who don’t.

In the 2018 case Abbott v. Perez, the Court approved election maps drawn by Texas’s Republican-controlled legislature that diluted the voting power of the state’s growing Black and Latino populations. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito criticized not the state but a lower court that had rejected the maps. The court, Alito wrote, had violated the “presumption of good faith” on the part of the legislature. The implication of that rebuke is that Texas’s attempting to discriminate against Black and Latino voters wasn’t wrong; noticing the attempt was wrong. The next year, in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Court concluded that partisan gerrymandering was a “political question” beyond the reach of the courts, paving the way for states to disenfranchise minority populations as a partisan act rather than a discriminatory one, as though the former cancels out the latter.

Trump is now urging emboldened Republican legislatures to gerrymander congressional districts much more in order to voter-proof the Republican majority in the House. His Justice Department sent Texas a letter saying that some of its voting districts “constitute unconstitutional racial gerrymanders” that must now be “rectified.” What that meant, remarkably, was that the districts had been made too diverse. In short, they were not racially gerrymandered enough. When a district-court majority—including a Trump-appointed judge—blocked the maps for being “racially gerrymandered,” it pointed as evidence to the DOJ’s own letter and that department’s complaint that the districts were “coalition districts” or “majority-non-White districts in which no single racial group constituted a 50% majority.”

The Roberts Court then overturned that decision, arguing that the lower court was “upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.” Not only did this repeat the Court’s earlier position that it’s wrong to notice discrimination but not wrong to engage in it, but the decision encourages states to draw discriminatory maps and lie about their intent, knowing the justices have their back.

Later this term, the justices will decide in Louisiana v. Callais whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act allows the creation of majority-minority districts. Louisiana has taken the position that the creation of such districts—a requirement meant to prevent lawmakers from disenfranchising minorities by slicing up districts to render their votes meaningless—violates the Constitution because “all-race based redistricting is unconstitutional.” The irony is that what Republicans want is to do is precisely race-based redistricting. If they prevail, the Fifteenth Amendment, which was adopted to eliminate racial caste, will be employed to maintain it. The only way to reconcile the Court’s jurisprudence with the Reconstruction Amendments, the Harvard Law professor Guy-Uriel Charles told me, is if you “turn the purpose of the Reconstruction amendments on their heads.”

This disenfranchisement will have long-term consequences—and not only in the arms race to the bottom reflected in the Democratic-controlled states that have shown themselves to be willing to retaliate.

As Frederick Douglass declared in 1865, the ballot is a means of self-defense, not simply a right or responsibility: “Without this, his liberty is a mockery; without this, you might as well almost retain the old name of slavery for his condition; for in fact, if he is not the slave of the individual master, he is the slave of society.” Americans of all races will suffer by this weakening of democracy. When lawmakers can entrench themselves in office regardless of public preference, they need not heed the will of the people.

The Fourteenth Amendment is under siege in other ways, too. Attacks on the rights of women (such as the right to not be forced to give birth by the state) and on trans people (who have been banned from serving in the military) also violate the amendment’s assurance of equal protection under the law. It is shockingly easy to find right-wing commentators advocating for the restriction of women’s right to vote and to leave a marriage, and even for employers’ discrimination against women in the workplace.

In the White House, Trump has been undermining discrimination law by refusing to enforce it. The administration has argued that Trump holds the authority to ignore laws banning job discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin for federal employees, and has rolled back enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. Aside from Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced his intention to ignore reports of discrimination or harassment.

Recently, the administration announced that it would not be investigating discrimination on the basis of “disparate impact,” in which discrimination can be proved through effect rather than intent alone. That can sound abstract, but here’s one example: The Trump administration ended a requirement that the state of Alabama provide Black residents with proper sanitation, calling it “illegal DEI.” Not flooding Black neighborhoods with raw sewage, according to the Trump administration, is racist.

The administration is also working to use laws that were meant to prevent discrimination to encourage it instead. Trump has weakened the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s ability to fight race- and gender-based discrimination in employment, instead directing it to threaten companies that maintain diversity programs. This week, the EEOC chair explicitly invited “white males” to file discrimination claims. The civil-rights division of the Justice Department has shut down its voting-rights cases while placing the department’s support behind efforts to disenfranchise minority voters. Administration officials have threatened lawsuits against schools and businesses for “illegal DEI,” giving those institutions a strong incentive to maintain an overwhelmingly white workforce so they don’t get sued. In the meantime, the Department of Education has reportedly almost entirely ceased investigations of racist harassment of students. This legal hostility has extended to state censorship of any acknowledgment of race and gender discrimination—save for that against white people and conservative Christians.

None of this is consistent with “equal protection of the laws.” But it is consistent with the Antebellum Constitution’s narrow definition of who “We the People” are.

A future administration could reverse those policies. But Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship is different. On the first day of his current term, Trump issued an executive order announcing that babies born in America to undocumented immigrants or people on temporary visas are not citizens. A lower court blocked the order, and later this term, the Supreme Court will hear the case. If the end of birthright citizenship is upheld, the country will be irrevocably altered. Even those whose citizenship is not in question might have to carry proof of citizenship at all times to avoid being kidnapped, detained, and possibly exiled by federal agents in the name of Kavanaugh’s “common sense.”

The birthright-citizenship clause was written into the Fourteenth Amendment specifically to overturn Dred Scott’s conclusion that Black people could never be citizens. Then–Chief Justice Taney’s rationale was simply that Black people were “not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States.”

Representative John Bingham of Ohio, dubbed the “Madison of the Fourteenth Amendment,” declared that there could be “no greater political atrocity” than denying birthright citizenship, because that would easily lead to a minority being subjected to “absolute despotism.” That the birthright-citizenship clause applies to everyone has been a subject of near-total legal consensus until Trump. There is no “originalist” case against birthright citizenship, but there is a partisan one.

Given the extreme nature of many of the conservative movement’s demands, the Roberts Court may not give into all of them, or at least not all at once. Some legal experts are skeptical that even this Court will allow Trump to nullify birthright citizenship by fiat. But the larger project of restoring the Antebellum Constitution will continue.

Before these amendments, the Antebellum Constitution contemplated the rights and freedom of white men, but no one else. It did not guarantee equal protection under the law. It did not protect the right to vote. It did not outlaw discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, or ethnicity. What it did was protect the right of some men to own other men as property, by definition an affront to the idea that “all men are created equal.”

When the 18th-century writer Samuel Johnson asked why “we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes,” he was identifying no mere contradiction, but liberty as it was imagined by men who owned other human beings as property. Slaveholders such as John Calhoun saw slavery as inseparable from their own freedom, and they worried that the false doctrine of abolitionism would eliminate that freedom away. “Already it has taken possession of the pulpit, of the schools, and, to a considerable extent, of the press; those great instruments by which the mind of the rising generation will be formed,” Calhoun said. (It seems the “woke mind virus” was telling lies about the great and benevolent institution of American slavery as far back as two centuries ago.)

Defending slavery, however, required invasive uses of power, such as banning antislavery literature and returning escaped Black people to bondage. Many white Americans in the 19th century began to understand that the “Slave Power” curtailed their freedoms as well. And this is what many people forget: Systems of domination rarely spread their blessings widely. The Redemption-era revocation of Black freedoms didn’t result in prosperity for white people writ large, but a Gilded Age in which the upper classes gained unfathomable wealth and economic crises left millions destitute. The nation may have held on to white supremacy, but it also got low wages, a threadbare welfare state, and a society dominated by the rich. Everyone else was too divided by race and class to challenge them.

The blood of Confederate soldiers who would never own a slave watered southern fields because they saw slavery as the cornerstone of their social and economic order. The Populists failed to ameliorate the deprivation of the Gilded Age because white laborers who had more in common with their Black counterparts chose the psychological wage offered by Jim Crow over the literal wages that might be earned through brotherhood. The MAGA elite offers a similar fantasy today, though the number of Trump voters who will see a loved one deported or their paycheck dwindle will eclipse by orders of magnitude those who rub shoulders with donors in his new ballroom.

MAGA’s ruling caste will not be as overtly racially circumscribed as in the past. But we can trace its contours in the Trump administration’s policy decisions and legal victories, and the Roberts Court’s resurrection of the Antebellum Constitution. The path the justices are walking leads to Calhoun’s paradise: an America where a class of stateless children can be denied education and medical care; where people of color must carry identification papers if they don’t want to be harassed, detained, imprisoned, or worse; where workers can be subject to invidious discrimination without recourse; where the military points guns at the taxpayers who fund it; and where the official ideology of the state is vindicated by elections the ruling party cannot lose. It will be a society of the dominators and the dominated. But it will not be a democracy worthy of the name.</div>

Fire up simh (or your real PDP-11) and step back in time.

Because with his collection of old hardware, I think he would enjoy getting it to run.

Or even better, get Unix v0 and boot in on your old trusty PDP-7 (or again, use SIMH).

I&#39;d be really, REALLY surprised if this image isn&#39;t chock full o&#39; flipped bits and other random garbage.

Some brands of tape fare better than others over the years. I&#39;ve had 7 track tapes from the late 60s still be readable.

There were two &quot;bad blocks,&quot; and both have been recovered.

i am curious of the condition of the tape. was this a situation where we got one shot to read the tape? did it self-destruct as it ran past the read head?

there&#39;s a video in the summary, you could try to guess the condition from it: https://discuss.systems/@ricci... [discuss.systems]

Since we&#39;re stepping back in time, I’m going there. Imagine a Beowulf cluster of tape readers! Ignoring if a cluster of tape readers even makes sense.

Nope. they store that tape in a climate-controlled environment...

Could this be the year of Unix on the desktop ?Don&#39;t we already have that w/ macOS?

Could this be the year of Unix on the desktop ?

It&#39;s great that they managed to restore this. Aside from the purely historic interest, early Unix had some fascinating tools - translators for B and SNOBOL and other languages, a text to speech converter, the m6 macro processor, the tmg compiler generator, and the early versions of roff/nroff/troff are very interesting too.

Yet the article cites a recent Stanford University study that found employment among software developers aged 22 to 25 dropped nearly 20% between 2022 and 2025, &quot;coinciding with the rise of AI-powered coding tools.&quot;  


The story is part of MIT Technology Review&#39;s new Hype Correction series of articles about AI.

It depends on your skills level. For trivial beginner stuff, it&#39;s OK but then again.

For anything out of mainstream which no or very few examples are available for the model to train, it&#39;s pretty much useless.

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

(You might ask: &quot;Do you mean that AI is a brute-force approach that burns huge amounts of electricity, etc., or that Bitcoin is?&quot;  To which I answer: &quot;Yes.&quot;)

Bitcoin doesn&#39;t lie on what it is and what it does. AI companies on the other hand ...

Well, plenty of blockchain proponents and companies do/did.

AI training uses energy to create value. The resulting model does it job. Bitcoin on the other hand can only exist as long as people keep burning electricity just because, as when people would stop the useless burning of electricity the blockchain could be forged and become worthless. So AI companies are optimizing to get the energy usage low (not last because it&#39;s their money they are burning) while Bitcoin is designed to keep the energy burning high just to be able to enforce an unforgeable ordering of ev

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

The bicoin bubble popped nearly a decade ago. You might remember that time when an iced tea beverage company changed their name to blockchain and shot up in value.

Just because bitcoin&#39;s still around doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t popped - does the existence of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, eBay, and dozens of other companies today mean the dot-com bubble never happened?

The AI bubble popping will bring these companies back down where we aren&#39;t going to see the giant circlejerk of Oracle buying Nvidia who invests in OpenAI who then places orders for more Oracle compute.

(And it might be cracking - given Oracle was recently rejected for billions of dollars in loans as their existing debt might not be repaid).

Doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t have ChatGPT at the end of the day, but we probably will see a slowdown - we went from GPT-3 to GPT-4 to GPT-5 in a few years, when it took far long for GPT-2 to come out and be &quot;scary&quot;.

Some bubbles just pop and disappear, like NFTs. Other bubbles pop and the market goes saner but we still have the benefits, like the dot-com, blockchain and likely AI. Chances are we will see AI used strategically rather than it being the solution to everything. And several things have come out of it - including awareness of deepfakes

Right now we are in the “first hit is free” phase of trying to get everyone hooked on this AI crap.  All these upstarts are trying to get marketshare and get some spaghetti to stick to the wall and the usage is heavily subsidized by all the startup money gushing in.  Once the influx peters out and these places have to pay their own rent we will see the reality of which companies are able to actually survive and which of the horde are houses of cards.

I fully expect there to be plenty of actual applications, but it will peter out to much more mundane than currently advertised.

That&#39;s just what the LLM is trained on, rather than anyone&#39;s skill at using the LLM.

I am a professional with decades of experience. I think that AI is best at prototyping. If I have an idea, I can ask AI to write a program that does that. That program does not work properly, it is full of bugs, but it will instantly tell me a lot of things. Most valuable thing it can tell me is that &quot;this idea does not work&quot;. That alone can save hours of my work. It will also reveal things that I didn&#39;t even think about, but which are essential for the idea to work.

Here is what keeps happening to me. I keep falling into the same trap.

I throw various simple things at the AI, sort of a Google replacement, and it gives me what I want. I&#39;ll have several successes. And then it will lead me down the wrong rabbit hole, misdirect me, refuse to break out of it&#39;s mistaken path, and waste way way way too much of my time chasing my tail.

Eventually, I&#39;ll arrive at my destination and I&#39;ll ask it why the fuck it took such a circuitous route full of errors and straight up lies to get to the simple and correct answer. It&#39;ll respond saying that it&#39;s complicated and that it doesn&#39;t have all the answers, sorry.

Tomorrow, I&#39;ll start with it all over again like a crack addict.

Yep, this is when the context is full. Nuke the chat and start again.

My current favourite is &quot;Oh, now I understand completely what&#39;s happening&quot; (for the seventeenth time in a row - all of which were too-hasty.

Yeah, one of the things I like about Claude (and Gemini 3 as opposed to 2.5) is that they really clamped down on the use of &quot;Oh, now I&#39;ve got it! This is absolutely the FINAL fix to the problem, we&#39;ve totally solved it now! Here, let me write out FIX_FINAL_SOLVED.md&quot; with some half-arse solution.  And yep, the answer to going in circles is usually either &quot;nuke the chat&quot; or &quot;switch models&quot;.

The key here is that it helps, but it can&#39;t replace you.  Not that I care whether you get replaced, but there are a couple trillion bubble bux riding on whether you can be replaced, so it&#39;s a big deal.

I have mostly experience with a large app that I have been building lately. I use VSC with Claude. I have some background in coding but I do not do it for a living. As a tool, AI works best when there is a plan to follow and a master document for it to update to record progress. Starting from a proof of concept first and then expanding from there provides clarity. Sometimes I have used another AI to create a refined method to be implemented by another AI.

What I do not like about AI coding: the intellectual

What I do not like about AI coding: the intellectual and memory challenges fade away. There is no more brainwork that I have liked about coding. Copy-pasting and especially auto-coding become boring quite fast, and I have no deep knowledge of the code. I do not have problems with it to think about: solutions to feel accomplished for. Those only come when I catch an AI doing something stupid.I have exactly the same problem copying code I have found on the web and now AI.  Typing it in instead of copy pasting is a huge help, especially if I change variable and function names and reformat on the fly.

AI companies should pivot to predicting  Anthropogenic Global Warming, I&#39;m sure it will be perfect for that.

All that matters is they have everyone&#39;s money, can influence elections and are too big to fail. Give them a break - AI is hard.

Professional dev in my third decade of experience speaking here. At first, these products really did assist quite a bit. In 2023 and 2024, I found the tools to be pretty decent at offering suggestions for small to medium snippets of code.

Something changed late last year. It may just be that the shine is wearing off, but I find most of the AI products producing less quality results than they did previously.

I rarely ever reach for them anymore. I sure would not rely on them over even an inexperienced junior dev, either.

Where chatGPT is an enormous help, is in the following:

Fourth decade here. Up until a few months ago I would have agreed with virtually all of the negative comments in here, but after a re-org I am now on a team supporting multiple AI products, and have become immersed in anything AI, including vibe coding.

For vibe coding, I&#39;ve had mixed results, but I want to make a couple of important points. First, the whole vibe-coding landscape is evolving very quickly. New IDEs and CLI tools are being announced almost daily. Second, the backend architecture of these tools

AI seems to be feeding the bloat habit instead of trimming it. It&#39;s becoming an auto-bloater.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony. Devs would rather collect buzzwords for their resume rather than try to trim out layers and eye-candy toys. It&#39;s kind of like letting surgeons also be your general doctor, they&#39;d recommend surgery more often than you really need it.

The principles of typical biz/admin CRUD haven&#39;t really changed much since client/server came on the scene in the early 90&#39;s. Yet the layers and verbosity seem to keep growing. An ever smaller portion of time is spent on domain issues and ever more on the tech layers and parts to support the domain. Something is wrong but nobody is motivated to do anything about it because bloat is job security.

YAGNI and KISS are still important, but is dismissed because it reduces one&#39;s resume buzzword count. The obsession with scaling for normal apps is an example of such insanity: there&#39;s only like a 1 in 50k chance your app or company will ever become FANG-sized, yet too many devs want to  use a &quot;webscale&quot; stack. You&#39;re almost as likely to get struck by lightning while coding it. They patients are running the asylum.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony.I&#39;ve come to accept that this as true, and further conjecture that bloat is often a corporate/institutional goal. 
This seems to be a joke [zerobugsan...faster.net], but in reality corporate incentives are aligned to make things more bloated. If you&#39;re a manager, then the more people you have under you, the more power you have. This means you want your people to go slower so you have to hire more of them.  
I don&#39;t have a solution but there must be one.

Eliminate wages, assuming the result still works, would be classed as a productivity gain.

I have met tons of h1bs who are great at what they do.I also know the h1b msp ecosystem that hovers around the redmond campus like flies on shit and 90% of these &quot;gold double platinum preferred msft vendor&quot; companies are an outright scam.

But since it&#39;s other companies being dead weight and not a human being, the grift is completely acceptable.  I know some of you might wanna say &quot;a businesses job is to make money! why would they allow that?!?!&quot; and to you gents i suggest getting a job and using your eyes.

In this, it is decent, and need to be something you actually understand as a result so you can proof read it.But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.

But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.I do this frequently, with both packaged agents and my modifications to them, just to see what comes out the other side.
Sometimes it&#39;s great, sometimes it&#39;s pretty bad.
I do it as a side job, not my regular work, so the consequences of the failure are minimal- I just throw it away and try again with another modification.
If it were my actual main workflow... I think that would stress me the fuck out- each failure being significant wasted time and money.

If you let it write code freely, you can spend hours or days trying to figure out what the f**k it&#39;s done and why it&#39;s not done what you asked or why it randomly introduces a complete re-write for a single-line fix.

Quite frankly, I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone all day, including an agent. And it&#39;s not really about being anti-social. As most people know, we have two primary brains - logical and emotional. I find that trying to explain what needs to be done the model engages my emotional/social brain too much, and the logical part can&#39;t focus on getting the job done. In order to do quality work, I need to completely ignore the emotional side of my brain and let the logical brain get into the state of flow, where I can accurate track the state of what I&#39;m working on and follow logical workflows only. Talking to an agent all day engages my social side too much to do quality work.

I wonder what you think about pair programming. Sounds like that would not match your style either. And some agent/human interactions are thought to be similar to that, either the agent monitors if you mistype something, or you review each step of the agent before letting it continue.

Right.. it&#39;s &quot;as near as he can tell&quot;... and you know what? I think it probably works too.  But if it doesn&#39;t the bug will be slippery as shit and tracking it down is as much work as rewriting most of the program.

and there&#39;s also the case it cranks out something broken and when you ask it to fix line 17 it&#39;s a coin flip if it goes &quot;oh silly me!&quot; and fixes it or goes &quot;oh wow silly me!&quot; and spits out an identical line.

I&#39;ve been saying this since oh chatgpt3,  you gotta give it small problems the same as if yo

I came across some Emacs elisp code I&#39;d written about 25 years ago, and it looked pretty useful.  Emacs didn&#39;t like it.  I researched the functions and variables and they apparently had been rejiggered about 5 years later.  I said to myself, Self, sez I, this could be an interesting AI test.  I could probably make this do what I want in a few minutes now if I did it from scratch, but that wouldn&#39;t help me understand why it was written that way 25 years ago.

So I asked Grok.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it understood 25 year old elisp code just fine, explained when and how they had been rejiggered, and rewrite it for the current standards.  That was more than I had expected and well worth the time invested.

One other time Grok surprised me was asking how much of FDR&#39;s New Deal legislation would have passed if it had required 2/3 passage instead of just 1/2.  Not only did it name the legislation which would not have passed, it also named all the legislation which had passed by voice vote and there was no way to know if 2/3 had voted for it.  The couple of bills I checked did match and were not hallucinations.  The voice vote business was a nice surprise.

I program now for fun, not professionally.  The idea of &quot;offshoring&quot; the fun to AI doesn&#39;t interest me.  But trying to find 25-year-old documentation and when it changed doesn&#39;t sound like fun, and I&#39;m glad to know I can offshore at least some of the dreary parts.

I&#39;ve worked for myself as an independent developer for more than a decade now.Apps and websites and I do well working on my own.I&#39;m getting old though that the saying &quot;can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks&quot;, is starting to make sense.AI couldn&#39;t have come at a better time in my life.As I&#39;ve always warned youth thinking of getting into tech at higher education, the older you are the less valuable you become. The complete opposite of the other white collar grad workers. You want the old experienced doctor, lawyer, accountant etc. Not the fresh faced grad; unless you are hiring software devs.Since I started using AI I&#39;ve found I&#39;m a magnitude more productive in my output and my overall success.It&#39;s such a time saver my home looks fab this summer (I&#39;m in NZ) as I&#39;ve had so much spare time to enjoy gardening.AI has knowledge. What it doesn&#39;t have is wisdom.As long as you remember that and have the wisdom and intuition to know when it is wrong you can&#39;t lose.Which gives me hope as an old timer in this game.Maybe after all I have what the other white collar grad workers have that is most valuable.Experience and wisdom which is why AI is no threat to any of us right now.

As a human, AI workflows let me have a life. I can let the agents knock out the easy things while I&#39;m working on other tasks. I still need design out what&#39;s to be worked on, review the code, fix bone mistakes they make, etc. It&#39;s basically like having a junior developer assigned to you.Every time I see someone talking about AI being a junior developer, I am quite certain they have never worked with a junior developer.

I really do think coding using AI tools is a bit faster, at least it seems that way to me.  As most of the morning but lengthy work can be done faster by AI.

But I am also pretty sure it&#39;s VERY easy to rapidly incur technical debt, especially if you are telling AI to review its own work.  Yeah it will do some stuff but who is to say post review fixes it&#39;s really better?

More than ever I think the right approach to coding with AI is to build up carefully crafted frameworks that are solid (maybe use AI to help

Hey you&#39;ll never replace an entire department with 1 junior dev and 5 managers talking like that buckaroo.

AI might make newbies faster at producing... something.  Probably something full of bugs and security holes.

But it won&#39;t help non-newbies with software development, of which &quot;coding&quot; is a relatively minor part.

Still, people like to concentrate on coding -- probably because software matures a

I&#39;ve been playing with these genAI system both as code producer but as helper on various tasks.And overall, I find the models quite brittle unless they are fine tuned on the precise task that you want.

The main problem that I see is that the tool is fundamentally a string in string out. But the strings could be absolutely anything including completely insane things without proper fine tuning.

Today, I am writing a simple automatic typo correction tool. The difficult bits are making sure that the tool didn&#39;t crap out. I mean, it is easy to check you actually got an answer from the tool. The problem is that sometimes the tools will tell you: &quot;Sure, I can fix typos. Here is your text corrected: &quot;. Ans so you have to toss that output out probably. But how do you figure out that it shat the bed? Well, you can&#39;t really, it is just as hard as the original task in some cases. So you bake various heuristics, or you get a different LLM to check the work of the first one.

At the end of the day, you really can&#39;t trust anything these tools do. They are way to erratic and unpredictible. And you should treat any of these tools as being possibly adversarial. It&#39;s exhausting to use really.

These wild swings between AI thinning out the workforce and making all our jerbs obsolete to not being sure if AI is even useful is giving me a headache.

It&#39;ll do both... dumb management and bean-counter types will replace people with AI, and the AI will suck at actually getting work done.

Been using the Claude CLI the last few weeks and it has definitely been a great assistant in working with Qt 6, C++, and QML.  The CLI interface is one of the best interfaces I have evey seen, and it&#39;s native use of markdown is ideal.  I am still writing 90% of the code but Claude&#39;s a great way to get information on some aspects of the library that I&#39;m not as familiar with.  I&#39;m not ready to set it loose with nothing but a specifications document yet.

When using AI to quickly mock up small chunks of code I find it an accelerator.  And I do mean small.

But when code scales up simple systems or API&#39;s it falls apart pretty quickly.  As the scale of the system grows the requirements grow even faster.  GDPR, PII, FIRB, NIST, all start to pile up on as code bases grow.  AI lacks the understand of the &quot;business&quot; need.  So you get this blob of code out and then you have to spend large amounts of time understanding it so you can re-factor it because the AI engine

Look buddy that&#39;s something we&#39;ll figure out after the corpo-feudalist business plot is finished.

I use AI regularly, at least once or twice a week. It&#39;s a real productivity boost. It&#39;s completely replaced searching for me. It&#39;s basically an API expert I can talk to and get answers from in 20 seconds. Good stuff.

Example: I&#39;m working on a bad code base of a legacy application. The backend is quite a mess which I don&#39;t really like to touch, so I push a lot of my new logic into our Postgres DB. I don&#39;t really like SQL and anything beyond one or two joins I&#39;d usually avoid. With progbuddy AI I&#39;m doing trigg

I use AI assisted coding in Agent mode daily. I see it as something similar to AutoTune for vocals - it&#39;ll make a good singer great, and a great singer world class. Anything less than a good singer, autotune is going to move to the wrong note and make it worse.

It&#39;s the same with coding - it&#39;ll make a good and great developers better, and mediocre developers worse. It&#39;s probably also important to acknowledge how I&#39;m using it as it&#39;s likely that your experience will vary depending on environmental variables-

As a software engineer I can easily say that AI coding assistants have solved problems that would have taken me weeks to figure out.Things like how to install something complex or how to write a relatively simple program in an unfamiliar language and framework.It&#39;s also created bugs, inefficient code and masked problems in order to get to that all important &quot;it&#39;s now running perfectly&quot; state.My worst fear is when the AI says something like &quot;I should take a completely different approach&quot; and then it begins t

            <div id="article-text">Perhaps waylandx [github.com] could help?  Might not work for a whole desktop, though.

Remote access of computers is more important than ever. There was one brief moment in history where it seemed obsolete that the computer you were using was not on your desktop. Today virtually every Linux computer is in a data center somewhere. Getting rid of X is pants on head retarded, and even if it were the right move it should have been done for technical reasons not intentionally causing X to die through lack of maintenance. The Xlibre guy is doing God&#39;s work.

That&#39;s why I linked to waylandx, not xwayland.  I agree that getting rid of X is retarded, and that wayland is not a fit replacement.

There are well-intentioned people who write code using the newest API (as that&#39;s usually the right thing to do) thus good programs that require wayland start popping up, that&#39;s what waylandx is for.  There are also severely misguided folks who drop X like KDE; I don&#39;t use KDE myself thus I can&#39;t comment on the details.

It looks like X will indeed die due to lack of maintenance,

You know that it is much easier to write remote desktop software using Wayland? You can implement it as a compositor and you&#39;re done. No need for Xdummy servers and similar crude workarounds to get programs run in background. You just provide a compositor that renders to a remote computer instead of to a display.

It&#39;s been many years since I used X for remote access.  It was always slow and glitchy and sometimes hard to get working right.  On the rare occasions when I need to run a graphical application on a remote computer, I use VNC.  It just works, in a way that X never did.

Xorg has been forked and active development is now done at Xlibre [github.com]. Hopefully that means that there will be enough pressure on Wayland that they actually fully reimplmenent all X functionality that people need. In any case, it provides a clear backup.

Sadly shade doesn&#39;t work current with kwin on Wayland.  It&#39;s very annoying. Also focus follows mouse is quirky on Wayland.  Other than that KDE on Wayland is pretty fantastic.

Wayland intentionally sabotaged focus-follows-mouse by making clicking on a window raise it unconditionally. Gnome did the same thing (for a while there was an option to turn off the raise, but they made it also ignore any requests from the program itself to raise the window so you could not actually rearrange windows except by closing and opening them again).

There does appear to be a large faction that wants focus-follows-mouse to go away and will do anything they can to achieve it.

Quite a few WMs (without attached DEs) have shade features. But the unique feature of kwin is focus steal prevention. Never seen that in another WM.

> It has its own set of defaults but in no way is it superior to any other window manager

KDE isn&#39;t just a window manager, it&#39;s the whole desktop experience...

For me it&#39;s mainly when I get an idea about how my usage could be more comfortable, so I rearrange stuff, change a few options and experiment.Now I do have trouble using computers that aren&#39;t mine...

Mate was a straight fork of Gnome 2, as such it&#39;s a 2 decade old time capsule.

Gnome 3 then made a series of idiosyncratic UI design choices which polarized the Linux community.

And if work imposes Windows 11 for my day job, I find XFCE/Debian on my home machine to be the least drama in terms of paradigms.

Out of curiosity, what functionality do you miss with xfce? I have been using it for a few years and find it overall ok, although I do have a few issues.

MATE is outdated (but good for resource constrained systems) and GNOME is dumbed down and hard to get good results from, you need a whole bunch of add-ins just to get where KDE is. KDE was very bad in the past, but it&#39;s really come quite a long way. GNOME was really quite good in the past, but it&#39;s really gone the wrong way. I&#39;m not against having a simple mode but I don&#39;t want oversimplification to infest everything.

I&#39;ve been hearing this a bit from very traditional greybeard linux users (I mostly just use linux at work and I&#39;m very much a terminal jocky. tmux is my &quot;terminal manager&quot;.) who have come around to KDE from being strong dislikers of it in the past. That Mate is just crusty and old, Gnome hasn&#39;t really been fun for a while but KDE has solved most of its nonsense problems and is now a quite complete and useable system, so its become their daily driver.

I just want to get alpine functional again so I can revert

The problem is, developers sometimes get too full of themselves and then start making changes that actively get in the way - which is where Gnome appears to be right now, for instance.

I want a window manager that lets me do what I need but mostly stays out of my way. Right now, for me, that&#39;s cinnamon.

This is why I first went to fluxbox without taskbar/decorations (on Debian) and later bare openbox (on Devuan) because the ctrl key stuck too often after switching workspaces.

There&#39;s nothing else but the programs and the unintrusive osd clock on my screen. It&#39;s the best &quot;desktop experience&quot; I&#39;ve had in decades of computer use.

The odd general fascination with cosmetics is not utilitarian, but piddling with cosmetics gives the illusion of accomplishment as if change were progress.

I already realised during the Windows days that while changing colours and wallpaper is fun, it&#39;s mostly useless when 99.99% of the time the actually used programs obscure everything.

Went from Ubuntu with Gnome 2 on my first private laptop to Debian/KDE to now Devuan/openbox because all I need is the graphical part to display the programs I use. Everything else (taskbar, wallpaper, even window decorations) don&#39;t add anything to my &quot;desktop experience&quot; because it either takes up space or can&#39;t be seen anyway. The most fancy thing is picom making inactive windows slightly transparent to put more emphasis on the active window.

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected he idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview &quot;I think everybody is adopting AI irresponsibly and I think it&#39;s going to have a net negative outcome on the socio-economic standing of the world,&quot; said Bars Juhasz. &quot;So let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t pitch more of a win-win future.&quot;

Juhasz, CEO of no-code automation biz WorkBeaver, told The Register in an interview that he hopes to encourage the adoption of AI-based automation – agents – from the demand side rather than the supply side, from the perspective of the office worker rather than management.

Around August 2024, he said, he sold most of his shares in Undetectable.ai, a company he co-founded, and found himself in a position to work on whatever he wanted.

Given his background in machine learning, he said, he started thinking about AI agents – AI models given access to tools – and how they&#39;re likely to affect society. The result was WorkBeaver.

&quot;We think companies are going to rush in, they&#39;re going to adopt AI too quickly, lay off people as a result of that, realize they messed up, and have to bring people back in,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;And wouldn&#39;t you know it? Here we are a year later, and it&#39;s played out almost to the T of how we hoped they wouldn&#39;t go, but here we are.&quot;

Juhasz expects that within five to ten years workers will have to demonstrate some level of AI proficiency appropriate to their roles, a view evident in Purdue University&#39;s new AI competency requirement as a condition of graduation. But, he said, &quot;a lot of people are just not going to be able to do that. They&#39;re just not in that position.&quot; Maybe they&#39;re non-technical, he said, or they&#39;re just resisting the technology.

Taking it slowly may be anathema in an industry that celebrates the Zuckerbergian zeal to &quot;move fast and break things.&quot; However, the consequence of urgent AI adoption imperatives is that someone has to deal with the mess.

&quot;Now we&#39;ve got these stories coming out of having to backtrack, of AI janitors, right?&quot; Juhasz mused. &quot;A whole new career dedicated just to cleaning up messes left by this rush.&quot;

WorkBeaver, said Juhasz, represents an attempt to help people become comfortable with AI, regardless of their level of technical competency.

&quot;So instead of focusing on the business side of the equation, the supply side, what if we focused on the demand side?&quot; he said. &quot;What if we focused on the people who are set to be displaced, who otherwise realistically have very little fighting chance to be in the competitive workforce in the next five to ten years?&quot;

WorkBeaver presently functions by using a menu-driven interface that asks users for prompt-based descriptions of tasks. The underlying AI agent then attempts to carry out the described task as if it were the human user, without requiring code or APIs.

The company website contains a variety of use cases designed to help people understand the sorts of tasks its tech can handle, because people don&#39;t necessarily see how AI technology can help them accomplish things. Examples include automated form filling, reminder setting, appointment setting, email sending, data gathering, and data entry.

&quot;Some of the people using WorkBeaver to create agentic automations don&#39;t even use ChatGPT,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;That&#39;s the level of non-technical we&#39;re targeting.&quot;

Juhasz said WorkBeaver&#39;s approach differs from other companies selling agentic tools through its focus on staff and what workers find helpful, rather than top-down directives to use AI without much understanding of the work being done.

&quot;For example, I spoke with reporters at Reuters and they have top-down mandates from managers who are not editors, who are not journalists, coming in saying: &#39;Okay, you guys have to use these tools X amount of times per week.&#39; To me, they&#39;re KPIs [key performance indicators], right? And the tools they&#39;re asking them to use are literally replacing the critical thinking process of the job. It&#39;s like put in the story, put in the sources, and it&#39;ll spin differently. Obviously, as you can imagine, they&#39;re not too happy about it. They don&#39;t believe that&#39;s where automation should be taking place.&quot;

WorkBeaver launched its private alpha in January this year and reached open beta in September. The company now has close to 4,000 users, according to Juhasz, primarily among small-and medium-sized enterprises. Customers are a mix of individuals paying out of their own pockets and of teams buying multiple licenses. Juhasz is also working on a deal with a laptop maker to have WorkBeaver preinstalled on business laptops in South America.

Juhasz said the company is a commercial success but has fallen short as a social enterprise that helps people become comfortable with AI.

One reason, he explained, is that deploying agents requires user education.

&quot;Education is required for prompting,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re about three to six months ahead of even OpenAI and Anthropic in this space. They&#39;re about to find out what we found out three months ago, which is the education requirement to make an agent do what you wanted it to do effectively by prompting is going to immediately cut out a lot of normal people.&quot;

The other reason, he said, is that &quot;People just didn&#39;t know what to automate.&quot;

WorkBeaver’s next release will address that issue. Due this month, the next iteration of the service replaces the menu-driven prompting process with an agent monitoring screen, mouse, and keyboard interactions as a way to learn the tasks users undertake and then repeat them.

&quot;What we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve created a very unique user experience where anybody, non-technical user, is able to create automations, agentic automations, with no prompting, no drag and drop,&quot; explained Juhasz. &quot;The way it works is you sit down with the agent and you collaboratively work through a task together. So basically anything you do on your computer, the agent should be able to take over.&quot;

The collaborative training process is the key – the agent can catch and correct potential points of failure as the worker is walking through the task. This avoids the frustrating experience of creating an agent-based automation that fails at runtime and requires a technical person to revisit the code or the configuration process.

Juhasz said WorkBeaver built its tech using Google Cloud Vertex AI. But the agent is model-agnostic and can, with a bit of training, work with any of the foundation models and can run in enterprise private clouds.

&quot;We are very much on the privacy end of the spectrum,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;Literally, the only things we store on our servers about you is your email address and your account balance. That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t need liability, so everything is stored locally on the users&#39; devices, fully encrypted. We learned from Microsoft&#39;s mistakes.&quot;

Juhasz added that WorkBeaver has a zero data retention agreement with Google Cloud. &quot;Your data lives and dies in ephemeral memory for a fraction of a second at most,&quot; he said.

Allowing an AI agent to control your computer is a security risk, one that Juhasz readily acknowledges.

&quot;I don&#39;t want an agent being able to access stuff it shouldn&#39;t have access to,&quot; he said.

WorkBeaver addresses this concern through application and folder allow-listing, alongside a few additional security measures.

The litmus test, said Juhasz, will be whether, when the new version is released in a week or two, non-technical people use the technology in a way that makes them happier at work. ®

            <h2>NIST tried to pull the pin on NTP servers after blackout caused atomic clock drift</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/21/nist_ntp_outage_warning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A staffer at the USA’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tried to disable backup generators powering some of its Network Time Protocol infrastructure, after a power outage around Boulder, Colorado, led to errors.

As explained in a mailing list post by Jeffrey Sherman, a NIST supervisory physicist who maintains the institute’s atomic clocks, “The atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed due to a prolonged utility power outage.”

Sherman, whose LinkedIn bio proclaims he is “One of the few federal employee actually paid to watch the clocks all day,” says one impact of the incident “is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference.”

That’s bad because one of the things NIST uses its atomic clocks for is to provide a Network Time Protocol service, the authoritative source of timing information that the computing world relies on so that diverse systems can synchronize events. If NTP isn’t working, outcomes can include difficulties authenticating between systems, meaning applications can become unstable.

At this point, readers might wonder why NIST can’t just turn off the inaccurate service. Sherman said a backup generator kicked in and kept the servers running.

“I will attempt to disable them [the generators] to avoid disseminating incorrect time,” he wrote.

But the storms that caused the outage were so severe, only emergency services personnel are allowed to visit the site.

His post says he has seen “strong evidence one of the crucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal distribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service.”

“Another campus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power generator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time scale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or reference signals,” he added.

Xcel Energy, the local utility, blamed the outage on strong winds and as of Saturday night local time (7:00PM MT Dec 20, 2:00AM UTC Dec 21) advised most customers would have power again within three hours.

However at the time of writing – 00:15 MT Dec 21 – NIST’s status page states the Boulder site is experiencing “Facility outages” and a “< 4.8us clock error.” That’s about four microseconds.

NIST told CBS News it warned users such as telcos and aerospace organizations that weather around Boulder could cause problems, and advised them to tap the org’s other sources of time information.

That’s sound advice as best practice for using NTP is to specify multiple servers, and failover from troubled sources of time info to accurate ones. This incident therefore shouldn’t trouble the prudent, but may leave some NTP feed users unawares if they rely solely on the Boulder facility’s time feeds. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

As chip markets go, DRAM is about as volatile as they get. - Click to enlarge

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

Holiday shopping on a budget can feel constricting, especially if you’ve been invited to a white elephant or need a last-minute stocking stuffer. The good news is that, with this guide, you can leave that stress behind.

Whether you’re aiming for something practical or fun, we’ve found plenty of great gifts for under $25 — heck, we found several under $10 — that don’t scream “I bought this at the gas station on my way over.” You might not expect to find a worthwhile Nintendo Switch / iPad-compatible controller, a 4K-ready streaming stick, or a waterproof speaker in this guide, but here we are. And that’s just the start.

Your desk could probably use a fun distraction to help you unwind a little in the middle of the day. The Mini Buddha Board lets you create ephemeral sketches using water and the included brush. Once the water evaporates you’ll be left with a blank board to create a new work, no cleanup necessary.

8BitDo’s Micro is a pocket-friendly, 16-button wireless game controller compatible with iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch. It can make playing mobile games easier than tapping a touchscreen, and it’s perfect for playing NES, SNES, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance titles on the Nintendo Switch.

A big roadblock to learning how stuff works is getting immediately bogged down by jargon. Author Randall Munroe sidesteps that in Thing Explainer by using the thousand most common English words to describe how bridges, data centers, helicopters, and the tectonic plates (and more!) work. The explanations are complemented by drawings that literally illustrate what’s going on.

SnapPower’s GuideLight can illuminate your dark hallway without permanently giving up an outlet to a nightlight. It replaces the cover around your duplex outlet receptacle and draws power by attaching its built-in prongs to screws on the side of your outlet. Once connected, the lights on the bottom of the GuideLight automatically turn on once it gets dark.

Finding the right video game to gift can be a challenge, but Paladone’s cartridge-shaped coasters are a fun alternative for fans of the 8-bit era. Each coaster features cover art from a popular game — whether it be Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, or Metroid — and can be hand-washed should a beverage spill on it.

Nobody should have to pay for a streaming service or cable just to watch live events like the Super Bowl, World Series, or Oscars. GE’s HDTV antenna can receive a TV signal from up to 40 miles away. Which channels you’ll get depends on your location, but CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS, and ABC are some of the most common stations that’ll be picked up over the waves.

Bentoheaven’s stackable bento box is slicker than most lunch bags. It comes with two large, 7.3-inch containers, a divider to help keep foods separated, and a smaller container for stashing snacks. The top container even has a compartment in its lid for utensils, and a velcro strap prevents the bento from opening in your bag.

A waterproof speaker should look good and sound good, too. Altec Lansing’s Mini H2O has an IP67 rating, floats when dropped in water, and has a built-in loop so you can attach it to a backpack with the included carabiner. The company claims its battery lasts up to six hours per charge. If you get two speakers, they can be paired together for stereo sound.

There’s nothing quite as nostalgic as building a Lego set. The 484-piece Medium Creative Brick Box contains the pieces you’ll need to make your own custom scenes, plus specific bricks to create Lego vehicles, animals, and other objects — including a windmill and toaster. The pieces come in a giant Lego brick-shaped bucket for easy storage.

Bluetooth earbuds are all the rage, but you’d be surprised how often a wired pair comes in handy. Apple’s EarPods have a surprisingly good microphone, never need to be charged, and should work with all your USB-C devices. An inline controller on the earbuds’ cable lets you change your volume and pause or skip tracks.

Using a physical notebook isn’t as convenient as dashing off quick ideas in your phone’s notes app, but putting pen to paper can feel more satisfying. Field Notes’ 48-page notebooks are pocket-friendly at 3.5 inches wide and 5.5 inches tall, and their graph paper makes them useful for sketching diagrams in addition to jotting down notes.

A wireless charging pad is a practical way to charge your gadgets without being tethered by a cable. Anker’s Qi2 15W MagGo pad is compatible with the iPhone, Android phones, or earbuds inside a wireless charging case. The pad snaps to your iPhone with magnets. For gadgets without magnets, the charging pad is large for easy alignment.

Bananagrams is a chaotic word game that can bring out the competitive side in anyone. The objective is to use tiles to create words that branch off of one another. The game is done once one player uses all of their tiles and the shared pool of tiles is empty.

A power bank is an essential travel gadget, and Baseus’ 22.5W model is feature-rich considering its low price. It has a built-in 8.6-inch retractable USB-C cable, so you’ll always have a cord with you, along with USB-C and USB-A ports to charge two more devices. Its 10,000mAh capacity is enough to fully recharge a smartphone with juice to spare.

GE’s 800-lumen Wi-Fi bulbs serve as a great entry point for making your home a little smarter. The color-changing LED bulbs work with Alexa and Google Assistant without a hub, and they support Matter for interoperability with Apple Home, making them a great choice if you’re unsure which smart home platform your giftee uses.

Staying hydrated is harder if your beverage spends most of the day sitting at room temperature. Hydro Flask’s 32oz tumbler is made from dishwasher-safe, BPA-free stainless steel, and it can keep beverages hot and cold for several hours. It’s big, but the tumbler’s tapered bottom can fit in car cupholders, and its handle makes it easy to carry.

Looking at your phone for directions while driving is very dangerous, but iOttie’s One Touch car mount can keep it at eye level for easy glancing when you really need to look. The suction cup mount has arms that grip your phone to prevent it from falling, and there’s even a cutout to hold your charging cable. It’s compatible with most smartphones — even larger devices like the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

A basic timer may seem like a thoughtless gift, but there are many tasks we procrastinate on every day that could be more easily managed if we dedicated a little bit of time to them. A visual Pomodoro timer like the colorful MOD (Home Edition) is key to helping break tasks into manageable, bite-sized chunks.

If you want to fix electronics instead of replacing them, you’ll need the right tools for the job. Kaisi’s 136-piece kit includes the spudgers, picks, tweezers, and screwdriver bits (111 of them!) to get inside gadgets and replace parts. The kit also has an anti-static wristband so you don’t accidentally short a motherboard with a shock.

A cast iron skillet is one of the few gifts that could last a lifetime. Lodge’s 10.25-inch skillet is big enough for cooking multiple burgers or pancakes at once, or baking biscuits or cornbread for a crowd. If you’ve never cooked in cast iron, remember not to soak it in water, and season it with oil fairly frequently.

If your TV struggles to run streaming apps well (or at all), consider Onn’s 4K Streaming Device. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and all your favorite apps via the Google TV interface, from Netflix and Disney Plus to YouTube. Recommendations are pulled from across services, and you can even use Google Assistant to search for shows and movies using your voice instead of the remote.

For older cars without built-in Bluetooth, get Scosche’s BTFM9, which can bring wireless music streaming to its speakers. It has USB-C and USB-A ports for charging gadgets and a Bluetooth transmitter inside. Once it’s paired to your phone, the BTFM9 can stream audio from your phone over an FM frequency picked up by your car’s radio antenna. It’s a simple, tool-free upgrade for almost any car.

Bachan’s Japanese Barbecue Sauce should be a staple in every household. The savory-sweet condiment is pretty atypical compared to American BBQ sauces, which often rely heavily on brown sugar or molasses for taste. Instead, Bachan’s recipe offers a nice balance of ginger, soy, mirin, green onion, and other Japanese flavors that work great if you’re trying to add a kick of umami to your next meal.

Everyone has felt the sinking feeling of losing their keys. Tile’s Mate is a Bluetooth tracker designed to fit onto your key ring. If you forget them, you can check the tracker’s location using an app to retrieve them. The Mate also has an SOS button you can push to subtly alert friends and family members you’re in an unsafe situation.

A multitool is a practical gift that won’t collect dust in a junk drawer. Gerber’s Dime has 12 tools, including wire cutters, scissors, nose pliers, two flat-head drivers, and a bottle opener. The Dime is only 2.75 inches long when closed, so it’s easy to carry in a pocket or keep in a car glove box.

This past year might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Groovy Glob, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

A smart plug adds functionality to an existing gadget rather than replacing it. Once the plug is connected to your Wi-Fi network and a gadget, you can turn it on and off using an app. TP-Link’s Tapo smart plug supports Matter, so you can add it to whichever smart home platform you use.

Having access to a spare headlamp is always a good idea, whether for grilling at night or sifting through an attic. The dirt-cheap Headlamp Pro might not be the brightest option available, but it runs on AAA batteries, carries an IPX4 weatherproof rating, and produces a 260-lumen beam that can illuminate up to 80 meters in front of you.

The Echo Pop is a compact smart speaker that’s perfect for a bedside table. You can use Amazon’s Alexa to set an alarm, play music, or control smart lights (and other accessories). If you have an Eero Wi-Fi router, the Echo Pop can extend the range of your network up to 1,000 feet. Read our review.

True globe-trotters know to keep a power adapter in their bag so they don’t end up with a dead phone in an unfamiliar area. Tessan’s 35W Universal Travel Adapter features five USB ports, a versatile AC socket, and three sets of retractable prongs that can be plugged into receptacles in more than 200 countries.

If you know a puzzler with a penchant for festive jigsaws, Galison’s Sparkling City might be the perfect gift. The 1,000-piece puzzle depicts a wintery scene with an ice rink, falling snow, a starlit sky, and trees covered with various holiday lights. The 27-by-20-inch puzzle also features foil accents, adding yet another festive touch.

A white noise machine can help you sleep or concentrate when silence is too boring, or when music or podcasts are too overstimulating. It can play 20 sounds, including blue noise, pink noise, rain or ocean sounds, or a fan. You can set the machine on a timer to turn off after one to four hours, or run continuously.

Hues and Cues is a board game that alternates between chill and absolute chaos. First, one player draws a card with a color on it and describes the color in a couple of words. Then, everyone else places their game piece on a board with 480 individual spaces, each with a different hue. Whoever guesses closest to the actual color scores points. It’s as simple as that.

No one should have to deal with a rat’s nest behind their desk when devices like Anker’s 2-in-1 USB-C cable exist. The handy USB-C cable splits at the end, giving you the ability to charge up to two devices from a single port. That means you can split power between a phone and tablet or juice a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in just 20 minutes using a single port.

Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most lauded Metroidvanias of all time. It’s an unrelenting game that requires patience, often requiring you to replay sections in an effort to learn how to defeat a boss or avoid a pesky hazard. You may have to take breaks, but the beauty of Silksong is that it often inspires you to give tough sections “just one more try.”

What’s the point of a clippable zip-up bag this small? Basically, you can use it to stash anything you would otherwise put in your pocket but fear slipping out. That includes chapstick, cash, cards, earbuds, you name it. Just be sure to leave the actual street tacos at your local tienda.

            <div id="article-text">Here are a few suggestions to freshen up your holiday playlist.

Here are a few suggestions to freshen up your holiday playlist.

It’s the holiday season, and Christmas music is utterly inescapable. Look, I love Mariah Carey and Wham! As much as the next guy. But at some point, you get really tired of hearing the same handful of Christmas songs over and over again. So here are 10 suggestions to add to your holiday playlist that are hopefully a little less obvious.

There’s a long history of downer Christmas songs, from Dolly Parton’s “Hard Candy Christmas” to The Pogues’ “Fairytale of New York.” But there is no holiday song more guaranteed to bring the party down than “Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis”. The reveal at the end is the sort of thing that will have everyone putting the gifts back under the tree because they’re too depressed to open anything.

I love the classic Bing Crosby and David Bowie version of this song, but I’ve heard it a bajillion times. Lindstrøm embraces the relentlessness of the marching drum pattern, teasing out the melody into a hypnotic slow burn that gradually builds into a spacey disco freakout. There are various edits of this track, from sub-five-minutes to the 20-minute one embedded above (which is probably the ideal version for your holiday playlist). However, I am partial to the full 42-minute rendition.

This is the calm comedown counterpoint to the Lindstrøm track above. All gently bouncing meditative synths, sleighbells, and chill vibes. If all you want for Christmas is a zen-like trance state, then queue up this song.

There aren’t enough hardcore holiday songs if you ask me. The titular David of “David Christmas” ultimately went on to be the central character in Fucked Up’s breakthrough rock opera David Comes to Life. “David Christmas” has sleighbells, references to the Grinch, and the first Noel. It’s the rare Christmas song that will have you trying to start a circle pit around the tree.

There are a weird number of Christmas songs about infidelity. (See Clarence Carter’s “Back Door Santa” and, at least from the child’s perspective, “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.”) But They Might Be Giants’ “Santa’s Bear” is a lesser-known one that pairs the duo’s trademark irreverence with a tale of a woman flaunting her extramarital affair in her husband’s face. Oh, and her sidepiece is dressed as Santa.

I’m just gonna say it — American holiday folklore is boring. Germany and central Europe have Krampus, the Welsh have Mari Lwyd, and Iceland has Jólakötturinn, or the Yule Cat. Jólakötturinn is an enormous feline that stalks the countryside, eating people who don’t receive new clothes for Christmas. Apparently, it’s supposed to encourage hard work and preparedness. In 1988, Iceland’s finest export, Björk, recorded a song about this creature that includes such festive lines as:

Slowcore pioneers Low released an entire Christmas album in 1999, appropriately titled Christmas. “Just Like Christmas” is probably the most approachable song on the record, and it moves along at a faster clip than much of the band’s material. It still showcases the band’s ear for delicate melodies and the late Mimi Parker’s intimate vocals, though, before fading out as drippy avalanches of drums crash around her.

A delightful song about telling someone to loosen up and have some fun.

Also, just casually referring to Santa Claus as “Sandy” is perfection.

A modern entry in the Christmas soul pantheon that can stand toe-to-toe with James Brown’s “Santa Claus Go Straight To The Ghetto.” “Ain’t No Chimneys in the Projects” has groove to spare, killer strings, and one of the best horn sections in the business. It’s a pretty short song about how the magic of Christmas is provided by hardworking parents, not some jolly weirdo in a red suit.

We’ve all had disappointing holidays when we didn’t get the gifts we wanted. 100 Gecs embrace the fantasy of exacting revenge on Santa and taking what you want in this goofy hyperpoppunk song. It’s an absolute blast with a chant-along “la-la-la” post-chorus. I might not play this one for your ungrateful kids, though.

We may be older than teenagers, but many of us here at The Verge are kids at heart. Plus, we’ve also got a few staffers with older kids. To make your life a little easier this holiday season, we rounded up what we think are the best gifts for teens, based on our tech expertise as well as what our staff’s teens are into right now.

Below, you’ll find gift ideas for many types of teens. Some are more obvious choices, like the latest iPhone and Nintendo Switch 2, but we sought to include a few picks you might not have thought of. For gamers, there’s stuff like powerful gaming laptops and immersive mood lighting. If your teen leans more into creative pursuits, we think they’ll be excited by getting a great phone mount for filming TikToks, or a sleek instant camera that produces physical photos. If they’re into doodling, a drawing tablet could be a perfect gift. We’ve also added Star Wars-themed Lego sets, board games, magnetic poetry kits, and more ideas specifically for those moments in life when they need to unplug.

The NASA-inspired Genki Moonbase functions as a 240W GaN charging station, one capable of powering up to seven devices simultaneously via three AC outlets and four side-mounted USB-C ports. The bigger draw, though, is that each outlet can display one of eight mesmerizing colors, providing a bit of style and substance.

Jem and Cozy’s cheeky, irreverent Naughty Birds Vinyl Sticker Sheet adds a touch of humor to just about anything, from laptops and lockers to water bottles and notebooks. The waterproof stickers are bound to make your teen (and their friends) giggle every time they see them.

If your teen is into mood lighting, Govee’s RGBICW smart floor lamp can add a stunning pop of color to any room. The 4.6-foot lamp can blanket their space in a wild array of colors, offering plenty of preset scenes to match their mood. Plus, it can sync with music.

Case-Mate’s Phone Charm may pass for just another cute bracelet, but it’s actually a useful accessory. The strap keeps your teen’s phone attached to their wrist, so they can snap selfies at a party, run errands, and more without worry that they’ll drop their pricey, vital smartphone.

The Mechanism Gaming Pillow helps gamers stay comfortable for hours on end. Made from soft, high-performance Lycra, it holds tech up so their arms don’t have to, letting them play longer without arm strain. It also comes with a mount to accommodate one of many gaming handhelds, from the Steam Deck and Switch 2 to the ROG Ally X.

From snapping memories at parties to decorating lockers and journals, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 41 is a must-have gift for teens who want to share photos the old-school way. It’s so easy to use, yet its black and silver body gives it a sleek, sophisticated vibe that older teens will likely appreciate.

Teens who live online want a gift that feels personal and current. Apple Gift Card covers it all, from gaming credits and trending apps to Apple Watch bands and music subscriptions. With easy ways to send it digitally or wrap it up as a physical surprise, it is a flexible gift that matches their creativity and energy while making the moment special.

JBL’s Clip 5 Bluetooth speaker delivers surprisingly good sound for its size. This tiny yet mighty waterproof speaker has a built-in clip (hence the name) that lets it easily attach to backpacks, bikes, and more, so you can play music or podcasts just about anywhere.

A Kindle is the superior alternative to carrying a stack of books from class to class, as if you needed us to tell you. Your teen will appreciate the pocket-friendly 6.1-inch e-reader, which can fit thousands of ebooks on-device without weighing them down during their daily adventures.

If your kid is a Nintendo fan, Alarmo should make waking up feel more fun. It plays sound effects from classic games, like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and characters appear on its 2.8-inch display. You can snooze with a hand wave or end the alarm by getting out of bed.

Apple’s latest AirPods Pro aren’t just great for listening to music. They double as a fitness tracker, thanks to a new built-in heart rate sensor that can monitor calories burned and provide progress updates in more than 50 workouts. They’re a great gift for any teen who’s into both fitness and music.

The HoverAir X1 will let your teen capture seriously cool shots. The pocket-size drone takes seconds to set up and is easy to use, with six customizable flight modes for hands-free shooting. It delivers impressive image quality (2.7K at 30fps) that’ll look great to share with friends and family.

If your teen has an Android phone, the Google Pixel Buds 2A are the wireless earbuds to buy. They’re comfortable, with crisp sound and good active noise cancellation that can help them focus while studying. Plus, they offer built-in Gemini, which they can use to summarize messages and more.

Don’t get tripped up by the “poetry” part — the Magnetic Poetry Kit is really just about having fun with words. The Original Edition comes with more than 300 magnetic tiles to mix and match, allowing you to cover your fridge with random thoughts, inside jokes, and other carefully chosen creations.

Your teen’s phone probably drains its battery quickly, so you should gift them Anker’s Zolo 10,000mAh portable charger. It comes with a built-in USB-C cable and multiple USB ports that deliver up to 30W of total output, so it’s perfect for their phone, Kindle, Switch 2, or other small gadgets.

Amazon’s latest Echo Show 8 smart display can do a lot. Its upgraded screen and speakers are great for streaming shows or playing music. For teens who care about smart home tech (they exist!), it doubles as an Alexa Plus-powered hub with support for Zigbee, Matter, and Thread.

If they’re a Swiftie, The Life of a Showgirl might end up being their favorite gift of the year. The glitzy, orange vinyl edition features all 12 tracks from the singer’s most recent album — including Opalite and the viral hit Fate of Ophelia — plus a few extras, including never-before-seen photos, lyrics, and a poem written by Tay herself.

For older teens (especially those who are college-bound), owning a good laptop is a must, and Apple’s M4-powered MacBook Air is one of the best. It’s fast and lightweight, with all-day battery life and a slim design that can easily slip into a backpack between study breaks.

The Wacom MovinkPad 11 is a great gift for an aspiring artist or designer. Its 11.45-inch display runs Android 14, so they can sketch directly in apps like Clip Studio Paint, Ibis Paint, or Krita. The best part? You don’t need to connect it to a laptop or PC, making it great for doodling wherever they are.

The Switch 2 is arguably the best gaming handheld available — especially now that it’s actually, truly available. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor, albeit welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula in our book.

Ray-Ban’s second-gen Meta smart glasses allow teens to snap photos, record short videos, play music, take calls, or even translate a menu, all without reaching for their phone. It’s futuristic tech packaged in a stylish pair of frames, but it’s not without its share of privacy concerns.

A VR headset lets you step inside of virtual worlds bristling with detail and interactivity. Few do it as well as the Meta Quest 3S. It’s the successor to the Quest 2, with similar optics but faster performance that matches the pricier Quest 3. Its relatively low cost makes it a great first VR headset for teens.

Who needs magnets when you have suction cups? Octobuddy’s cheap silicone mount works with most phones to provide hands-free flexibility whenever necessary. It features 24 single-sided cups, which allow you to stick your phone to a mirror, window, or any other surface you think will provide that perfect TikTok angle.

Crunchyroll is like Netflix for anime, granting anime-obsessed teens access to the latest shows and movies just after they air in Japan, along with thousands of classics. A paid membership also grants ad-free viewing, early access to episodes, exclusive discounts, and more.

Let’s face it, going with the base-model iPhone used to mean you were giving up some key features. Not anymore. Apple’s latest iPhone is outfitted with a 120Hz screen for smoother gaming and scrolling, an always-on display, double the base storage, and the same 18MP ”Center Stage” camera found in the iPhone Air and 17 Pro.

For the Star Wars fan in your life, the Dark Falcon set is a 1,579-piece kit that lets them re-create the dark version of the Millennium Falcon, complete with a removable cockpit, bunk beds, and even a throne. The set also includes minifigures like Darth Jar Jar, Beach Luke, and Bounty Hunter C-3PO.

The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro combines a portable color-changing smart lamp with a Bluetooth speaker. Through the Govee app, you can customize its LEDs to sync with your music, or to display the light scene of your choice. It’ll let you set the mood for a party or for a night of studying.

Wyrmspan is a one-to-five-player tabletop game where you build a sanctuary for dragons, rising through the ranks of the Dragon Guild and working to attract different species. With stunning artwork, it’s a beautifully designed game that’s perfect for fantasy lovers and strategy fans alike.

Despite its slim design, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a gaming powerhouse with an AMD Ryzen 9 270 chip and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Its customizable RGB keyboard adds a stylish touch, while the long battery life ensures your teen can enjoy hours of uninterrupted gaming.

The Lego Animal Crossing Stargazing with Celeste set lets fans bring Animal Crossing into the real world. With just 78 pieces, you can build a peaceful outdoor scene featuring Celeste, the astronomy-loving owl. It also connects to other Animal Crossing playsets, if your teen wants to expand on it.

If they already have an iPhone, the Apple Watch SE 3 is the smarwatch to get. It offers many of the features found on Apple’s pricier models but at a far lower cost, allowing you to leverage on-device Siri, make use of Apple’s latest gesture controls, and track a boatload of fitness activities without absolutely destroying your paycheck.

Stuffed animals might seem too kiddish for your teen, but Pusheen the cat was made to melt hearts of all ages. The squishy, avo-toting plushie is one of the coziest gifts you can give this year, whether it ends up on a bed, on a desk, or simply on the old ’gram. Needless to say, it will become their emotional support “animal” in no time.

If they spend all day typing, gaming, or chatting with friends, the Keychron V1 Max is a great gift. Its vibrant per-key RGB backlighting adds personality to any desk, while the hot-swappable 75-percent design and remappable keys offer a level of customization you won’t find in most keyboards at this price point. Plus, there are magnetic garages to stash the included USB-A and USB-C 2.4GHz dongles so they don’t get lost.

Lush’s Bath Art set blows regular bath bombs right out of the water. Inside are two bombs that fizz into glittery swirls of neon blues, hot pinks, yellows, and purples — basically turning your bathtub into a masterpiece. And with relaxing scents like peppermint, grapefruit, and cedarwood, they smell as good as they look.

The Backbone Pro might be the most flexible controller out there. Like prior models, the USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad over Bluetooth.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road. Read the full story.—Caiwei Chen

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
