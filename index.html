            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Dec. 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. The story behind this remarkable achievement is nowhere more fully told than in the book Reentry, authored by Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. To mark the tenth anniversary, Ars is reprinting a slightly condensed chapter from the book that tells the inside story of this landing. The chapter begins in June 2015 with a tragedy, the disintegration of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the CRS-7 cargo supply mission for NASA. It was the first time a Falcon 9 had been lost in flight.

Seconds after the Dragon-bearing Falcon 9 rocket broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, David Giger shouted into his headset, “Dragon is alive!”

In the decade since he joined the company straight out of graduate school, Giger had taken on management of the entire Dragon program, reporting directly to Elon Musk. He watched the CRS-7 launch from mission control in Hawthorne not with a particular role, but rather providing a leadership presence. Giger could sense the Dragon mission team, mostly younger engineers, freeze up as video showed debris from the rocket showering back to Earth. A lot of the people involved in the hairy early flights of Dragon, including the C2 mission in 2012, had moved on to other positions at SpaceX or departed.

“They were a great team, but I think everyone assumed it was over,” Giger said. Unlike a lot of his colleagues, Giger had endured some trying times at SpaceX, including three failures of the Falcon 1 rocket. After the Falcon 9 shattered, Giger noticed that Dragon continued to send data back. It had separated from the rocket and was flying some thirty miles above the Atlantic Ocean.

The key to saving Dragon was opening its parachutes before it got too close to the ground. SpaceX had not anticipated such a contingency, nor planned to send commands to Dragon as it rode on the Falcon 9 rocket. But in an emergency, the Dragon control center could talk to Dragon using ground-based antennas. So controllers in California frantically worked to configure this communications system and command the two drogue parachutes to open. These are the small, precursor parachutes that stabilize the vehicle prior to deployment of Dragon’s three main parachutes.

The command was sent, but nothing happened. Dragon continued to dive.

For about two minutes after the rocket’s breakup, the plucky spacecraft faithfully relayed data. Then, less than a mile above the ocean, below the horizon from the Florida coast, the data stopped. The spacecraft and its 4,000 pounds of cargo plunged into the sea.

Opening the parachutes was not as simple as pressing a button. It required operators to send more than a dozen specific commands, in the correct order, to manually deploy the parachutes. In their haste—the operators had only seconds to act before the spacecraft fell too close to the ocean for its parachutes to have a meaningful effect—they had forgotten to turn on power for parachute deployment.

The unnecessary loss of Dragon was one lesson SpaceX took away from the failure of the nineteenth launch of the Falcon 9 rocket. In the aftermath of this CRS-7 failure, during long and intense meetings, Musk focused most of his time and energy on the rocket. But more than a few times, Musk would turn toward Giger and other Dragon officials and complain about its loss. “Dragon shouldn’t be fucking stupid,” Musk would admonish the team. “It should have saved itself.” By the next Dragon mission, this emergency scenario would be baked into the rocket’s launch procedures. If need be, Cargo Dragon could be saved.

The high-profile failure of the CRS-7 mission in June 2015 hit SpaceX hard. After five years, of challenging work with Falcon 9 and Dragon, the company had started to hit its stride. The Falcon 9 won a string of lucrative commercial satellite contracts. NASA, too, invested billions of dollars in SpaceX to launch humans onboard Dragon one day. Then it all fell apart. Carrying cargo for its most important customer, SpaceX blew up its rocket in spectacular fashion.

The loss of CRS-7 came at an inopportune time for NASA, as well. Half a year earlier the space agency’s other commercial provider of cargo services, Orbital Sciences, lost a NASA mission when its Antares rocket exploded just above the launch pad. Critics of the agency’s support for commercial spaceflight reemerged in Congress, underscoring the severity of the setback and raising questions about whether private companies could be trusted with human spaceflight.

In the first three years SpaceX flew the Falcon 9 rocket, from mid-2010 to mid-2013, it launched just five times. This flight rate was completely unacceptable to Musk, and after introducing version 1.1 of the rocket, he expected this cadence to increase substantially. He charged the Florida site director, Brian Mosdell, with delivering the capability of launching more than one Falcon 9 rocket a month.

But that was not Mosdell’s only task. He also spent much of 2013 spearheading SpaceX’s charge to obtain a lease for a second launch pad in Florida. This was to be none other than the most historic launch pad in the Western hemisphere, NASA’s Launch Complex 39A. Surrounded by swampland and rising just a few feet above the Atlantic Ocean, the sprawling 200-acre site includes the hallowed ground where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took their last steps on terra firma before walking on the Moon. Later, dozens of shuttle missions also launched from there.

Following retirement of the shuttle in 2011, NASA no longer had any use for the launch site. The agency’s inspector general characterized the pad as “unneeded infrastructure,” and leasing the facility to a commercial launch company would offload millions of dollars a year in maintenance costs. SpaceX, already flying, seemed like the obvious choice as it sought a suitable site for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches and eventually crew flights for NASA. However, in the spring of 2013, another bidder emerged. Jeff Bezos held a reverent fondness for space history and sought to lease the site for Blue Origin and its New Glenn rocket.

To sweeten his proposal, Bezos offered to share the launch complex with SpaceX or another company. While this was a generous offer, Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket in 2013, nor was it close to having one. Because of this, NASA awarded a twenty-year lease to SpaceX in September.

Musk was giddy after winning, having secured the landmark site. But he was also tweaked by Bezos’s bid, which he believed was intended to block his access. In an email to Space News, Musk mocked his would-be competitor. “If they do somehow show up in the next five years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the space station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote. “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”

Musk also mocked Blue Origin during internal meetings at SpaceX. He would say things like, “A company must really stink to call themselves BO.” History vindicated him. Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket ready to fly from Launch Complex 39A within five years. Or ten. As of the writing of this book, the company’s New Glenn orbital rocket has yet to make a single launch attempt (Editors note: Blue Origin did launch New Glenn for the first time in early 2025). SpaceX, in the meantime, has launched more than 100 rockets from the old NASA pad.

Mosdell wrote a majority of SpaceX’s proposal to win the lease for 39A, including all of its technical materials, its schedule, and its budget considerations. After the company acquired the lease, he fully understood all of the work entailed in demolishing the old shuttle infrastructure and building a launch tower capable of supporting the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

His relatively small staff included seventy-two full-time employees and about eighty welders and other contract hires working on a new transporter. They already were maxed out by Musk’s push to launch monthly from SLC-40, putting in 80- to 100-hour weeks to keep up. Accordingly, Mosdell traveled to Hawthorne in January 2014 to meet with Musk and Shotwell about staffing up his operations for the buildout of Launch Complex 39A. During the meeting, Mosdell outlined what he believed to be a “lean” team to complete the design, procurement, building, and testing of the site. He then asked to hire sixty-eight people over the next six months.

Musk rejected the idea. The meeting spiraled downward from there, and Musk’s parting words to Mosdell were, “Go home and work harder.”

As a leader, Mosdell keenly felt the demands he placed on his team with intense work schedules. Eventually they would burn out and leave, or the quality of their work would suffer. When he raised these concerns with Musk and Shotwell, they would always say the money was tight, and if Florida could just buckle down and get the next payment milestone, some of the burden could be lifted off the team. Mosdell’s meeting in Hawthorne convinced him things really were never going to change. SpaceX would never enter a cruise phase; it would only accelerate.

“There was not going to be a genuine effort to fix the problem,” he said. “This was going to be a shut up, go home, and color kind of thing. And I decided I was no longer going to go to the Cape and tell my team to just keep going because things would change. Because I knew it was bullshit.”

During his six years at SpaceX, Mosdell had delivered. He built the team that scrappily built the SLC-40 launch pad for about a tenth the cost of SpaceX’s competitors. He worked as a launch director for six missions. They started with almost entirely manual launch operations, and by the end of 2013 reached the point where about 90 percent of the countdown was automated. Under Mosdell’s watch, the launch site had a perfect record. He also led the campaign to win NASA’s competition for its historic LC-39A site. He had laid the foundation for the success that ultimately awaited SpaceX in Florida.

Musk was not displeased. In his mind, Mosdell and the team at Cape Canaveral had not gone hardcore enough. Launching once a month was not enough. Musk believed Falcon 9 rockets should be flying from Florida once a week. In hindsight, this is a cadence the company would not reach for nearly a decade.

To fill Mosdell’s role, Musk turned to one of his people. Ricky Lim had joined SpaceX in 2008, spending months on Kwajalein during the final three flights of the Falcon 1 rocket. He came of age during the early years at SpaceX, surviving the crucible of the Falcon 1 and near death of the company. He then helped out at Vandenberg, alongside Zach Dunn and Lee Rosen. In the wake of Mosdell’s departure, Lim was asked to fill in as site director at Cape Canaveral for a few weeks. Three weeks would turn into six years.

The launch team at the Cape consisted of two halves. One was built from converts from the legacy rocket companies, including United Launch Alliance, where Mosdell had come from. The other half consisted of young engineers who had typically taken their first job with SpaceX. Musk felt Mosdell was too closely aligned with the legacies. Lim, he felt, would rally the younger blood.

And so he did. From mid-2014 onward, SpaceX started to hit a groove at the Cape. There were bumps along the way, of course, and eventually SpaceX would hire not sixty-eight additional employees as Mosdell had requested, but hundreds more for launch and pad rebuild work in Florida. Yet by April 2015, Lim and his team managed to launch a pair of missions—the sixth operational cargo mission for NASA and a Turkish communications satellite—within just thirteen days of one another from Florida. Eagerly, they moved to the next mission on the manifest, another cargo supply mission for NASA: CRS-7.

On the morning that CRS-7 lifted off, Lim set aside his site leadership role to serve as launch director. All went well for the first two minutes of the flight. However, at 2 minutes and 19 seconds, Lim started to hear chatter on the network about “data drops” from the second stage. He glanced up at a video showing the rocket far down range, a white streak climbing into an azure sky. While there was some sort of vapor cloud around the upper stage, the rocket’s nine engines were burning just fine.

“It was surreal,” Lim said. “What we saw in the data did not match what we were seeing. The first stage was still going. On the long-range cameras, it looked a lot like prior launches. I thought the second stage people were mistaken, to be honest.”

He believed it might be a ground software display issue or some other minor problem. A second or two more clarified matters. The large white cloud expanded, engulfing the rocket. As it dissipated, the tracking camera showed a shower of debris as pieces of the rocket began tumbling back to Earth. A hushed silence fell over the flight control room.

Musk watched the launch from England, where he was celebrating his forty-fourth birthday. Seeing his rocket disintegrate was a lousy birthday present. His first call was to Dunn. After working for five years launching rockets, Dunn had taken over running SpaceX’s propulsion department just a few months earlier and observed the launch from inside the Mission Control Center in Hawthorne. Dunn told Musk he did not have an immediate explanation for the failure and passed his phone to Jon Edwards, an engineer supervising the launch. Edwards said it looked as though some kind of pressure event had occurred on the second stage.

During past traumatic moments, Dunn had felt empowered to take immediate action. When a Falcon 1 rocket had started imploding during transport on a C-17 rocket over the Atlantic Ocean, Dunn had risked his life to climb inside the booster to open a pressure valve. But this was different. “In this case, I didn’t really know what to do immediately,” he said. “That was kind of the creepy thing about it. We knew we had to go and see if there was any debris in the ocean. But there was not a ton of immediate action other than starting to figure out what took place. It was a really painful, shocking moment.”

Dunn walked out of mission control and back to the propulsion area of the office. He called his team together and gave a quick talk about what had just happened. Like Giger, Dunn was now one of SpaceX’s veterans and had persevered through the Falcon 1 failures. He explained that launching rockets was a high-risk business and that the way to get through this challenge was to work methodically to find out what happened, fix the problem, and fly again.

Musk returned to California and dove into the accident investigation with frenzied energy. At least daily, and often multiple times a day, he convened meetings in his executive conference room on the first floor of the company’s headquarters. A black conference table dominated the middle of the room, around which nine chairs were situated in a large U. People presenting at the meeting filled the chairs. More engineers sat or stood around the sides of the room. Musk always stationed himself at one end of the table closest to the door, facing a wall that featured a large canvas print of the Falcon 1 rocket launching from Omelek Island, a cautionary tale of the company’s desperate roots.

“The vast majority of the people at the company today have only ever seen success, and so you don’t fear failure quite as much,” Musk said after the accident, which he publicly described as a “huge blow” to SpaceX. “To some degree I think the company as a whole maybe became a little complacent.”

Indeed, the company had grown ten-fold since its last failure in 2008. As the Falcon 9 had streaked through its first eighteen launches, some of the Kwajalein veterans like Dunn and Lim would discuss how few of the company’s employees had experienced the pain of launch failure. By the time of the CRS-7 mission, only about 5 percent of employees had that experience, so they were somewhat numb to Musk’s mantra that “only the paranoid survive.” Before every Falcon 9 launch, Musk would email the entire company and say that if anyone had a serious concern about the upcoming launch, he wanted to hear it. And he was genuine about this. He wanted to hear risks and, if they sparked wider concern, act on them.

Because of SpaceX’s growing size, downtime was expensive. With a staff of approximately 4,000 employees at the time of the failure, SpaceX needed to fly frequently to pay the bills. Personnel costs alone exceeded $70 million a month. So Musk pushed for a thorough, but rapid, investigation. During the CRS-7 failure analysis meetings, he would listen as department leads shared their latest information on the investigation. Often he interrupted with a question, a comment, or a sharp critique. These were tense and frustrating and difficult discussions because the true cause of the accident remained a mystery for several weeks. Underlying it all was a sense of unease and uncertainty about the fate of SpaceX.

“Elon brought a tremendous amount of energy to those meetings,” Dunn said. “You always have to bring your best with Elon, but in these sort of tense moments you had to be right there. One hundred percent focus. No bullshit. You better be able to explain what you know, what you don’t know, take direction very crisply, and understand what he means with precision. If not, he pounced.”

The responsibility for investigating the failure fell on one of Musk’s oldest and most trusted lieutenants, Hans Koenigsmann. At the time, Koenigsmann served as vice president of Flight Reliability and Mission Assurance, which essentially meant ensuring safe and successful launches.

“I feel like if I’m responsible for the risk, I’m also responsible for when it goes wrong,” he said. “It took five months, and I worked around the clock. I took one weekend off, I think. Otherwise, I worked every single day of those months. I worked my ass off, and my team did, too.”

Part of the challenge in understanding what had gone wrong is that the rocket had gone from flying normally to a conflagration in just 800 milliseconds. Koenigsmann’s team knew almost immediately that the problem originated on the second stage, which had not yet separated from the first stage. But it had all happened so fast, in a fraction of a second. As a result, engineers and scientists from SpaceX and NASA had just 115 pieces of telemetry data (that is, measurements from various sensors onboard the rocket during that critical second when the upper stage failed). From this, they ultimately determined that the liquid oxygen tank had ruptured after a container containing pressurized helium broke free inside the tank.

Why are there bottles of helium in the LOX tank? As a rocket launches into space, it steadily burns propellant and oxidizer. As these fluids drain, helium gas is released to fill the vacated volume and maintain a downward pressure. This ensures that propellant and oxidizer continue to flow into the engines. The helium container is called a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV, because a strong fiber is wrapped around a metallic container to ensure its integrity. The more difficult question for Koenigsmann, therefore, became understanding why a COPV bottle containing helium had broken loose and struck the upper dome of the oxygen tank with catastrophic effect.

Eventually, some structures engineers pinned the cause of the failure down to a small $4 part about the size of a Tootsie Pop. This stainless steel eye bolt, also known as a rod end, helped secure the COPV to the wall of the oxygen tank. It had broken during the rocket’s ascent. Koenigsmann said these rod ends were rated to withstand 10,000 pounds of force, but one of them inside the ill-fated upper stage had broken under less than 2,000 pounds of force.

Nearly all rockets and spacecraft undergo a rigorous design process. The last checkpoint before a project moves into fabrication is known as “critical design review.” During this review for the Falcon 9, SpaceX had required the use of a more expensive rod end, Koenigsmann said. This part costs about $50. Somewhere between this design review and the actual flight, however, a cheaper rod end had been substituted. This steel rod end cost significantly less and was manufactured by a casting process. This meant it was made by pouring steel into a mold, where it solidified, and then was ejected from the mold. The more expensive rod ends worked fine at cryogenic temperatures inside the liquid oxygen tank, but cast materials were more problematic when pulled under the force of tension as they could have unknown flaws hiding inside.

SpaceX tried to find the actual rod end that had broken, to ensure it had nailed down the original cause of the failure. Searching for a thumbsized part fifty miles off the coast of Florida, hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, proved to be a rather Don Quixote–like quest. The company even hired a remotely operated submarine to look for wreckage. In the process, it found long-lost hardware from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs, but no Falcon 9 parts. However, Koenigsmann was confident that a cast rod end was the culprit because SpaceX tested similar parts from the same purchase order and found they were subject to breaking under cryogenic conditions.

So why had SpaceX switched to a cheaper cast rod end? Musk had instilled a culture of always looking to cut costs. Someone decided that a $50 rod end was too expensive and would be substituted with a cheaper part. Every strut on the rocket used rod ends, so there were hundreds of them on the vehicle, meaning this single change saved more than a thousand dollars on a launch vehicle. In their zeal to control costs, Musk and his lieutenants made such decisions thousands of times. Had Musk not been so judicious about costs, the price of a Falcon 9 would have ballooned. And in nearly every case, the approach worked—except this one.

In the fall of 2015, Koenigsmann wrote a detailed report about SpaceX’s findings and presented it to NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. The report concluded that “material defects” were the most probable cause for the broken rod end. This essentially put the blame on the rod end’s supplier. NASA’s own, independent findings leveled a harsher judgment more directly on SpaceX. NASA attributed the failure to a “design error” by SpaceX. The space agency also said SpaceX’s quality control process should have identified the substandard rod ends before they were installed on the rocket.

“The implementation was done without adequate screening or testing of the industrial grade part, without regard to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a 4:1 factor of safety when using their industrial grade part in an application, and without proper modeling or adequate load testing of the part under predicted flight conditions,” the report stated.

In other words, NASA said SpaceX had messed up, not the supplier. Koenigsmann said he accepts that SpaceX should have done a better job screening the rod ends. But he said the supplier deserves blame as well. “SpaceX and the supplier screwed up,” he said.

Koenigsmann still keeps one of these rod ends in a desk drawer at home, to not forget the lessons of CRS-7.

Despite disagreeing over the fundamental cause of the supply mission failure, NASA and SpaceX continued to work together well. When Dragon sank into the ocean, NASA lost $118 million in cargo, including a crucial docking adapter needed to enable future astronaut missions to the space station. The failure also increased the US space agency’s reliance on Russia. For several months, the only means America had of getting its astronauts to the space station, and feeding them, came via a pair of small spacecraft designed during the Soviet era that launched from Kazakhstan.

Publicly, however, NASA did not chastise SpaceX for these problems. Rather, its officials remained supportive. During a US Senate hearing in 2016, when some elected officials would have celebrated an opportunity to lambaste the company, NASA’s chief of human spaceflight stood up for SpaceX when asked about the failure.

“They turned around very quickly,” the official, Bill Gerstenmaier, told Congress. “Within a matter of days, they were actually in a test facility on the ground testing the failure that they thought had occurred. That getting into test was much faster than I could have ever done on a NASA side. By the time I would have had the ability to get contracts written and done the proposals and put the test sequence in place, it would have been a half a year.”

SpaceX, in turn, sought to make NASA whole for its losses. A few months after the accident, the company quietly agreed to fly five future cargo missions, its sixteenth through twentieth flights to the space station, at discounted prices. SpaceX also increased the amount of cargo each Dragon mission would carry, giving NASA more bang for its buck.

This assumed, however, that SpaceX could get the Falcon 9 rocket flying safely once again.

Even had the cargo mission not failed, the Falcon 9 still faced months of downtime during the second half of 2015. Musk had decided the rocket needed another significant upgrade, to version 1.2, which later became known as Falcon 9 Full Thrust. This represented a massive evolution to the rocket’s capabilities. Drone ship landings were essential to making the economics of first stage reuse work, but they were not the only step. SpaceX also needed to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the rocket. No part of the Falcon 9 was spared a ruthless revision, and in the end, SpaceX engineers produced a new machine that increased the lift capability of the Falcon 9 by nearly one-third.

The propulsion department designed an upgraded version of the Merlin 1D engine that raised the thrust of each engine by about 15 percent. The structures department built a lighter rocket that was easier to manufacture. And all of the lessons learned from the Grasshopper program and landing attempts in the Atlantic Ocean were poured into the design of the new rocket legs and control systems.

However, the real linchpin of the upgrade involved a technology known as propellant densification, or squeezing as much fuel as possible onto the rocket. This sounds wonky and wholly uninteresting—but it is not. The science and engineering of super-chilling rocket fuel is fascinating, and its implementation tremendously risky. Within a year of seriously starting work on densification, SpaceX would blow up a rocket, destroy a launch pad, and lose a $195 million Israeli satellite. Some former Apollo astronauts viewed SpaceX’s approach as so dangerous they urged NASA to never let its astronauts fly on rockets fueled this way. Musk knew the risks, he accepted the risks, and in the end, SpaceX beat the risks.

Densification, however, was a tremendous challenge heaped on SpaceX at the same time the company’s employees were scrambling to recover from the loss of the CRS-7 mission, satisfy NASA’s concerns, and work through the finer points of landing first stages.

“Elon grasped the essentials of the reuse problem,” (senior SpaceX engineer) John Muratore said. “He kept telling us we’ve got to get more performance. We’ve got to get the liquid oxygen colder. He just kept driving us.” Somewhat understatedly, Muratore added, “It was quite an intense time.”

SpaceX densified both oxygen and kerosene, but since the former had to be chilled to much colder temperatures, it was far more difficult to handle. Oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth and essential for life. Humans cannot breathe without it, and in our bodies, it chemically reacts with molecules from food to produce energy. Similarly, this process of oxidation occurs when oxygen combines with a fuel. Firewood, for example, cannot burn without oxygen. And so oxygen is an essential component of producing combustion within a rocket engine. In fact, most rockets burn more oxygen than fuel on the way to orbit. Onboard the Falcon 9, in terms of mass, there is more liquid oxygen than kerosene fuel.

Musk reasoned that by packing more liquid oxygen into the rocket, it could get better gas mileage. He was certainly not the first person to think about forcing oxygen into a denser state and thereby increasing the amount that a rocket’s tanks could hold; NASA had previously studied propellant densification over the decades.

Recently, the agency had dismissed it, yet again, for the Constellation Program. But this decision was not based solely on physics. Rather, it was due to politics and rivalries between the agency’s field centers. Marshall Space Flight Center, in Alabama, already had its bread and butter with existing propulsion technology. And NASA management had little appetite for the exploding test articles that would necessarily accompany densification development. Neither of these were barriers at SpaceX, which could afford to fail—and indeed publicly celebrated its test failures as evidence of pushing beyond the bleeding edge.

By densifying liquid oxygen and kerosene onboard Falcon 9, SpaceX could squeeze an extra 8 to 10 percent of performance out of the vehicle. This was not trivial. It meant carrying two more tons of payload to orbit. This was extremely important for a reusable rocket, which was paying a significant mass penalty for returning to Earth due to its landing gear and other added components. For economic viability, therefore, Musk believed densification was as important as drone ship landings. If he could accomplish both, the Falcon 9 could truly be the world’s first twenty-first- century rocket—reusable, high-performing, and cost-effective.

So how does one densify oxygen? One way is to use liquid oxygen instead of gas. Liquid oxygen has a pale blue, ghostly color. It condenses at –297.33 degrees Fahrenheit (–182.96 degrees Celsius), far, far colder than the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica. It is colder than even the darkest areas of the Moon that never see sunlight. This makes working with liquid oxygen difficult. However, the upside for rockets is worth it: Liquid oxygen is 1,000 times more dense than gaseous oxygen, so most rockets use liquids.

What Musk wanted to do was make this liquid oxygen still more dense by chilling it down, almost to a solid. This is basic chemistry, as the cooler a substance gets the more its constituent molecules slow down, thereby bringing them slightly closer together. So the colder SpaceX could get its liquid oxygen, the more that could be packed onto the rocket.

This is how one day, in 2015, Muratore and another engineer named Vincent Werner found themselves on the phone with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a Maryland-based agency that is the world leader in measuring physical properties. Werner and a handful of SpaceX engineers had been poring over tables published by the agency that showed the various temperatures and pressures at which oxygen, nitrogen, and liquid air—a mixture of mostly oxygen and nitrogen— turned into solids.

“We called them because they had generated the tables,” Muratore said. “And they were like, ‘You know, guys, these were extrapolated tables. Nobody’s ever worked down here before. The tables are approximately accurate, but they could be off by a degree or two, or a psi or two.&#39;”

SpaceX was not just looking to experiment with liquid oxygen at its coldest temperatures; it planned to produce vast quantities of the stuff. For a single rocket launch, the company needed to make hundreds of thousands of gallons. The actual work of producing densified oxygen fell to a small team of about eight engineers in Cape Canaveral, including Phillip Rench.

He seemed an unlikely hire for SpaceX. Rench earned a degree in mathematics from Southern New Hampshire University, which is not known for aerospace greatness. Rench then spent nearly a decade working at SeaWorld in Orlando, where he performed an odd assortment of jobs, from underwater maintenance to fixing amusement park rides. While working at SeaWorld, Rench discovered a knack for devising solutions to challenging problems. In 2010, a veteran trainer at the park, Dawn Brancheau, was dragged to her death by a killer whale named Tilikum while gently rubbing the creature. After the incident, Rench helped build a giant submersible floor that lifted the whales out of the water, to make it safer for trainers to interact with the creatures. It was Rench’s first time working with complex valves and other components used in control systems.

After seeing a promotional video that depicted a Falcon 9 rocket launching and landing in Florida, Rench was blown away. So he applied to SpaceX and was hired early in 2014 to help modify Launch Complex 39A. Rench watched the fateful CRS-7 launch from the vantage point of this pad, alongside the other engineers, technicians, and interns working on the old NASA site.

“Everyone was super depressed,” he said. “But the next day we came back at 150 percent, with energy and passion. You know the five stages of grief? Yeah, we went through that really quick.”

Engineers at McGregor had performed preliminary densification tests, and some of the early work in Florida was led by Brian Childers and Gavin Petit. Rench worked with a team that included Petit, David Ball, Chris Wallden, and others. Because the Florida crew had no practical experience with super-chilled oxygen, they more or less just started connecting equipment and seeing what happened. SpaceX used liquid nitrogen to chill liquid oxygen because the colorless gas turns into a liquid at –320 degrees Fahrenheit (–196 degrees Celsius), below that of LOX. To further chill the liquid oxygen, the engineering team flowed it through a pipe, around which was wrapped a coil of tubing filled with liquid nitrogen. The two never mixed, but the warmer LOX would shed heat into the liquid nitrogen. As this heat moved in, some of the warmer bits of nitrogen started to boil off. SpaceX used very powerful vacuum pumps to suck this heat away. Over time, as the pressure dropped, the temperature of nitrogen fell below –340 degrees, and the liquid oxygen followed. They could not go much colder, as nitrogen freezes at –346 degrees Fahrenheit (–210 degrees Celsius).

Rench loved the work. He had spent years working on valves and other systems to control the flow, temperature, and pressure of liquids. When his team was pushing liquid oxygen to its extreme, it was not so different from SeaWorld. Over the course of a few weeks, he and the other engineers developed procedures by which this super-chilled LOX could be made and stored in a large, insulated tank at the LC-39A launch pad. They worked in pairs, for eight-hour shifts, seven days a week. The nights were eerie, with a soundtrack from purgatory.

“Liquid oxygen does not want to be densified,” Rench said. “Densification makes this low, horrible growl. When we first started densifying LOX, the Praxair delivery drivers would be pumping the warm LOX into the sphere and it would make all kinds of crazy noises. They were getting nervous to be around it, and these are people who have worked with liquid oxygen for pretty much their entire lives.”

NASA had been skeptical about SpaceX’s plans for densification at Launch Complex 39A, so it asked for a demonstration. After Rench’s team delivered and NASA signed off, the fluids team at the launch pad started stripping the parts and pumps away from the LOX chiller system. They were needed at SLC-40 to make the densified propellant for the debut flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust.

After two failed drone ship landings, Musk felt ready to try landing on land. This had a major advantage over the ocean, as the rocket need not contend with high seas. Ground was ground—flat and unmoving. But there was a major disadvantage, too. In returning the Falcon 9 rocket to land, it would fly near cruise ships in Port Canaveral, the National Reconnaissance Office’s multibillion-dollar Eastern Processing Facility, and numerous other launch pads and valuable assets.

SpaceX acquired an old Cape pad, Launch Complex 13, in February 2015 for the purpose of returning the rocket. Trip Harriss, who had been with the company since its days on Kwajalein and the Falcon 1, now bore responsibility for Falcon recovery efforts and led the build-out of Landing Zone 1. He and Bala Ramamurthy also worked to convince the Range commander that SpaceX should be allowed to aim rockets at the Air Force station, a first.

“As the Range commander, you’re used to rockets going away from you,” said General Wayne Monteith, who commanded the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral from 2015 to 2018. “So when you see one that’s 180 feet tall and coming back, as the person responsible for the safety of everyone on that installation, you start to get a little worried. Your career dissipation light starts blinking.”

Harriss and SpaceX provided data to convince Monteith and other Air Force officials of the project’s safety. It helped that the ocean landings, although not successful, came close to hitting the drone ship. So Monteith felt confident that if SpaceX damaged any property at the Cape, it would be the company’s own equipment. SpaceX also demonstrated that the vast majority of the booster’s return flight profile was over water. If something went wrong, a destruct signal could be sent to the first stage before it threatened anything on shore.

Before he signed off on a landing attempt, however, Monteith had to convince his supervisors the plan was safe. As the weeks ticked down toward SpaceX’s return to flight, opposition started to get louder from the National Reconnaissance Office, which was concerned that vibrations from the rocket’s sonic boom—as it slowed from supersonic to subsonic speeds—would damage the delicate work being done in its payload processing facility.

Range safety analysts predicted the Falcon 9 flyback would produce a sonic boom comparable to the major 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event in Russia, damaging buildings and homes in the Cape Canaveral area and causing widespread damage. There was little data to refute these claims, which came as part of a lengthy and official-looking 100-page report defending the analysis. Alongside those claims came a stark warning that the United States would lose assured access to space, possibly for years, due to damage of critical launch facilities.

Why was there such caution? Unless the military is in the midst of a war, it is a risk-averse operation. Asses are on the line if there is a screwup. Monteith knew the buck stopped with him and that by making the call to allow SpaceX to land at Cape Canaveral, it was his particular ass in the line of fire.

“During a meeting, a commander’s call, I stood up and said I believed this was the right thing to do,” Monteith said. “In doing so I understood that if anything went wrong, I would be fired.”

In early December, SpaceX received a green light from the Air Force to not just launch a missile, but to bring one back to the station. This is pretty remarkable, as SpaceX was flying a brand-new version of its Falcon 9 rocket, which was returning to flight after a launch failure, with densified propellant onboard for the first time.

Predictably, the run-up to the launch was chaotic. After SpaceX solved the rod end issue with NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration and obtained permission from the Air Force to dive-bomb its rocket back to the Cape, it still had to refine new procedures for densified oxygen.

One challenge with the densified oxygen was the inability to “recycle” a launch attempt if there was some technical or weather problem at the appointed time for liftoff. Once the super-chilled propellant was loaded onto the rocket, SpaceX had minutes to launch, or the liquid oxygen would become too warm. Although there was spare oxidizer in the LOX ball, offloading the warmed liquid oxygen from the rocket to this storage vessel would spoil the colder oxygen there. Dumping all the rocket’s LOX was not an option, as this would damage pipes and other launch site infrastructure.

As launch director, Lim also kept a concerned eye on the calendar. SpaceX had targeted the night of December 21, 2015, for the return to flight launch. The rocket would loft eleven satellites for the telecommunications company ORBCOMM into low-Earth orbit, with a total mass of about 4,500 pounds. This was a light enough load for the Falcon 9 to have plenty of spare fuel to return to Landing Zone 1. Everyone had worked intensely to get ready for the launch and was counting on a few days off over the holidays. Many talked of quitting if they did not get a break soon.

“We were desperately trying to save Christmas,” Lim said. “Our employees had been working months on end, and I worried that about a third of them might leave. If we scrubbed and plowed through the holidays, it would just have been murder.”

Once again, Lim directed the launch from inside the company’s control center about eight miles from the pad. In the early years, there were two principal leaders during a launch, the director and the chief engineer. This created a tension on launch day, as the director served as the “gas pedal” and the chief engineer had a more cautionary role as the “brake.” Koenigsmann typically served as chief engineer of launch, but due to his focus on the CRS-7 failure, he delegated the role to Robb Kulin.

Koenigsmann and Musk watched proceedings from inside the control room. The countdown was tense. In the final minutes before liftoff, scheduled for 8:29 pm local time, a camera inside the interstage area between the first and second stages showed drops of a pale blue liquid dripping down. This was a novel problem due to working with densified propellant for the first time, and it might indicate a number of bad things. Kerosene leaking might result in a fire. Liquid oxygen could lead to an explosion. Reviewing data and video, the launch team determined it was probably “liquid air,” or air that had been cooled down to cryogenic temperatures by the frigid tanks. Hastily, the launch team discussed whether to scrub and investigate the leak.

At T-1 minute, Koenigsmann turned to Musk. “You’ve got to make a decision,” he said.

Almost invariably, Musk delivered his decisions with confidence. He liked to command while others obeyed. But in this instance, with everything on the line for SpaceX, he responded casually, almost dreamily. “Well, I guess we’re going,” Musk said.

The upgraded version of the first stage performed perfectly. After dropping off the second stage, the rocket burned for home, dropping out of the black night down to the Florida coast. Nearer to land, from the vantage point of the launch control center, the rocket disappeared behind the tree line with a spectacular orange glow and a huge cloud of dust. Then there was a huge, building-shaking blast.

“That scared the shit out of us,” Koenigsmann said. He and Musk thought the rocket exploded. Musk’s countenance sank, despondent and disappointed.

Someone on the launch team suggested they check the video feed from the landing site. It told a happier story. The Falcon 9 rocket? It was there, standing upright on the landing pad, smoking in the mild Florida evening.

They had been fooled by the reentering rocket’s sonic boom, which had been delayed a few seconds traveling to the launch control center. The room erupted in applause and cheers.

Musk’s mood reversed entirely. He became delirious with joy, absolutely smashed full of happiness and pride for persevering long enough to see this moment. His faith in bringing rockets back from orbit and landing them, so often questioned, had been validated. Like a kid in the candy store, he kept pressing Lim and the launch team to go out to the landing pad and see his beautiful rocket. Three different people who had been with Musk for years said they had never seen him happier.

SpaceX had negotiated range safety protocols with the Air Force in the event of a landing. The rocket still had explosives onboard, including TEA-TEB ignition fluid, the rope-like flight termination system, as well as liquid oxygen and kerosene. A safety team had to secure the rocket first. But in less than an hour, Musk, Koenigsmann, and others, including Kulin, Harriss, Shana Diez, and Lee Rosen, donned hard hats to go running and skipping and dancing across the landing pad. As they danced about, they noticed there had been no apocalyptic meteor event, nor property destruction of any kind. Even the basic windows in an office trailer by the landing site bore nary a scratch. The launch of the new rocket and its unprecedented landing were a complete success.

“It’s hard to describe how epic this comeback was after our first Falcon 9 launch failure,” Koenigsmann said.

As he, Musk, and the others marveled up at that sooty rocket, illuminated by flood lights beneath dark and starry skies, they must have wondered if this moment could ever be eclipsed.

They were pretty excited back in Hawthorne, too. As the rocket touched down, hordes of employees crammed into the factory floor just outside mission control started chanting, “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!” A raucous celebration ensued.

The four thousand employees of SpaceX had wrought nothing short of a miracle in the six months preceding that night. The company worked on four separate, massive projects in parallel, packing their final exams into that single launch. Riding onboard the Falcon 9 rocket in late December were the company’s return to flight mission, a significant upgrade to the Full Thrust version, an unprecedented oxygen densification program, and the first landing. They saved Christmas, to boot.

The historic ORBCOMM launch and landing delivered one of the most cathartic and breathtaking moments in SpaceX history. I do not believe it is possible to overstate the significance. With its fate on the line, the company roared back from a terrible and financially disastrous failure. And, on the very same flight, SpaceX accomplished something no company, or country, had ever done before. Until then, SpaceX had followed in the footsteps of NASA and others in launching rockets, flying satellites into space, and landing spacecraft in the water. Sure, it did so in cheaper and innovative ways. But these were well-trodden paths. No one had ever, ever launched an orbital rocket and landed it back on Earth minutes later.

Catriona Chambers came to SpaceX in early 2005 as an electronics engineer. Within months on the job, she picked up responsibility for the Merlin engine computer on the Falcon 1 rocket. On that small rocket’s very first launch, there was a sensor that measured atmospheric pressure. After reaching space, the first stage would descend back to Earth, and when the sensor detected a thickening atmosphere, it would command deployment of a parachute. She and everyone who worked on the rocket knew this was preposterous. The rocket would probably never survive, and the parachute would be practically useless. But Musk pushed hard for reuse from the very beginning of SpaceX. Now here she was, almost eleven years later, observing it actually happen. As director of avionics, she watched with her team as the first stage landed, feeling the weight of history as she hugged and high-fived her friends.

“That was the point where it really sunk in that we had been working on this for so long,” Chambers said. “It just felt so massive, and I was so excited. And then I realized I needed to calm down.” She was eight months pregnant, after all.

Like a lot of SpaceX employees, Zach Dunn felt both exhilaration and relief at the launch of the ORBCOMM mission. He had taken over the propulsion department in February, with the aim of completing the Merlin engine upgrades for the Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9. Within the first couple of weeks on the job, two engines blew up. Then the CRS-7 launch failed, and Dunn was thrown into the tortuous investigation. Finally came the arduous campaign to ready the new rocket and update the launch site for densified propellant.

This gave the propulsion team fits right up until the launch date. On December 18, the company had to abort three separate attempts at completing a static fire test. The launch team was still learning, on the fly, how to load and offload super-cold liquid oxygen, when Musk came into the control room. Invariably, his presence raised the level of tension and urgency. Dunn explained to Musk that by the time the rocket was ready to ignite its engines, the propellant was warmer than the engines were expecting.

“My engine team was telling me this was not the right thing to do,” Dunn said. “That we weren’t going to get the data we needed from the test. The pressure from Elon was just absolutely intense.”

On launch day, Dunn sat next to Shotwell in Hawthorne’s mission control. As soon as the booster touched down, Shotwell leapt to her feet, joining the merriment. After a few minutes of also celebrating, Dunn left and walked across the factory floor to the propulsion area. About five dozen engineers were there, almost all of his propulsion department.

“It had been a hard fucking year,” Dunn said. “This was my hardest year at SpaceX, leading propulsion, going through those failures and trying to keep the team together, and the pressure of getting back to launch. It pushed my leadership and technical abilities to their limits. My interface with Elon was more direct and more intense than it had been before. It had taken a toll.”

As Dunn walked toward his desk, the other engineers, one by one and then in a rush, stood up and applauded him. A standing ovation. It was completely unexpected. Dunn had come into the department as an outsider, having led pad operations at Vandenberg. There were a lot of egos and a lot of brains in SpaceX’s propulsion department. During the preceding ten months, Dunn had fought with this team as well as for this team. He’d won some. He’d lost some. But after that night, he was no longer just their leader. He was one of them.

“Man, I’ve never felt better in my life,” Dunn said. “It felt incredible to experience that after the hardest fight that I’ve ever had professionally.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jared Isaacman, a pilot and financial tech billionaire, has commanded two groundbreaking spaceflights, including leading the first private spacewalk.

But his most remarkable flying has occurred over the last year. And on Wednesday, he stuck the landing by earning formal Senate approval to become NASA’s 15th administrator.

With a final tally of 67 to 30, Wednesday’s Senate confirmation came 377 days after President Trump first nominated Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator. Since that time, Isaacman had to navigate the following issues:

One of the biggest questions about Isaacman after his nomination in late 2024 was whether he had the political gamesmanship to run NASA. Few questioned his interest in space, knowledge of the industry, or flight experience. But he had no political experience. Could he handle the rigors of managing a tempestuous White House and fractured Congress?

The answer after he navigated the last year appears to be, quite clearly, yes.

The 42-year-old private astronaut becomes the youngest person to lead NASA. He has waited more than a year to take on the job, subjecting himself to scrutiny of his financial dealings, divesting himself of conflicts of interest, and answering question after question from lawmakers.

Now, finally, he will get a chance to act, rather than react to everyone else.

As the Project Athena plan clearly demonstrates, Isaacman has a good handle on the problems besetting NASA, an aging and increasingly bureaucratic agency. NASA can still do great things, but it has become almost infinitely harder since the heady days of Apollo six decades ago.

Isaacman has ideas to shake things up, but not to the extent of wanton change for the sake of change. It is clear from the interviews he has given to others, and in talking to him myself, that Isaacman is also a good listener. He wants to understand problems to he can work with others to apply thoughtful solutions.

Perhaps most importantly for NASA, unlike some other Trump administration nominees, he appears to be a builder, not a leveler.

Isaacman is coming into a beleaguered and bruised agency that has faced an extraordinarily difficult year. Thanks in part to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, about 20 percent of the agency’s 17,500 employees took buyouts or early retirements. There have been significant layoffs at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and there are concerns about the future of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Moreover, the agency is locked into a high-stakes race with China to return humans to the Moon, which, over the last 12 months, has swung in China’s favor.

NASA’s administrator is responsible for carrying out the administration’s policies and working with Congress to secure funding to do so. In this, Isaacman finds himself between a Trump administration that sought to cut NASA’s budget by 24 percent, and a House and Senate that rejected the vast majority of those cuts in budget bills.

Looking over the last year, it would be easy to say NASA and Isaacman have lost more than half a year because of the withdrawal of Isaacman’s nomination in late May, when he was within days of bipartisan Senate approval. However, in the intervening months, Isaacman has made strong contacts within the US Senate and the White House. As part of the campaign to build support for his renomination, Isaacman emerges with considerably more political experience, a much closer relationship with Trump, and a deeper roster of contacts in his phone.

All of which is good, because for all of the fancy flying Isaacman has done to reach this point, his most difficult sorties lie ahead of him.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Physicists at the University of Amsterdam came up with a really cool bit of Christmas decor: a miniature 3D-printed Christmas tree, a mere 8 centimeters tall, made of ice, without any refrigeration equipment or other freezing technology, and at minimal cost. The secret is evaporative cooling, according to a preprint posted to the physics arXiv.

Evaporative cooling is a well-known phenomenon; mammals use it to regulate body temperature. You can see it in your morning cup of hot coffee: the hotter atoms rise to the top of the magnetic trap and “jump out” as steam. It also plays a role (along with shock wave dynamics and various other factors) in the formation of “wine tears.” It’s a key step in creating Bose-Einstein condensates.

And evaporative cooling is also the main culprit behind the infamous “stall” that so frequently plagues aspiring BBQ pit masters eager to make a successful pork butt. The meat sweats as it cooks, releasing the moisture within, and that moisture evaporates and cools the meat, effectively canceling out the heat from the BBQ. That’s why a growing number of competitive pit masters wrap their meat in tinfoil after the first few hours (usually when the internal temperature hits 170° F).

Ice-printing methods usually rely on cryogenics or on cooled substrates. Per the authors, this is the first time evaporative cooling principles have been applied to 3D printing. The trick was to house the 3D printing inside a vacuum chamber using a jet nozzle as the printing head—something they discovered serendipitously when they were trying to get rid of air drag by spraying water in a vacuum chamber.  “The printer’s motion control guides the water jet layer-by-layer, building geometry on demand,” the authors wrote in a blog post for Nature, adding:

At very low pressure, water molecules at the liquid surface escape continuously as vapor. Each departing molecule carries the latent heat of vaporization, thus cooling the water jet. The very fine jet we use for printing has a very high surface-to-volume ratio, making heat extraction very efficient: the bulk liquid cools rapidly, dropping tens of Kelvin over a fraction of a second. When the jet reaches the substrate or a previously deposited ice layer, it freezes just after its impact.

And when the holidays are over, just turn off the vacuum pump and watch your tree melt back into its watery state, “no residue, no post-processing waste.”

The applications aren’t limited to Christmas trees. The purity of the ice makes it ideal for biological applications such as scaffolding for tissue: any branching ice form can be cast in resin or polymer and when it melts, it will leave behind hollow channels. It can also be used to create custom fluid networks for microfluidics applications. And if you have plans to camp out on Mars with its cold temperatures and thin atmosphere, the method could enable 3D printed structures out of water ice, with no need for heavy and expensive cryogenic equipment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Bermuda Triangle, a loosely defined region bounded by Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico, has been the subject of countless urban legends, from mysteriously disappearing ships to entire World War 2 squadrons. Outlandish theories have suggested that technology left over from the mythical lost city of Atlantis, lurking beneath the triangle, could be to blame.

But instead of the remains of a fabled city, geologists have made an entirely different discovery while examining the archipelago of Bermuda in the middle of the North Atlantic. As detailed in a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Carnegie Science seismologist William Frazer and his colleague, Yale University professor of Earth and planetary sciences Jeffrey Park, say they’ve found an unexpected, 12.4-mile-thick layer of rock lurking below Bermuda’s oceanic crust.

“Typically, you have the bottom of the oceanic crust and then it would be expected to be the mantle,” Frazer told Live Science. “But in Bermuda, there is this other layer that is emplaced beneath the crust, within the tectonic plate that Bermuda sits on.”

The team suggests the massive structure may date back to the last major volcanic eruption in the area some 31 million years ago, which caused mantle rock to be injected into the crust. This rock then created a raft-like slab that raised the ocean floor by 1,640 feet, as Live Science explains.

This floating “swell” has yet to subside over tens of millions of years of volcanic inactivity, a mystery Frazer and Park set out to solve.

They analyzed seismic data collected on Bermuda to probe to a depth of about 31 miles below the island territory.

They found a “thick underplated layer of modified lithospheric mantle” that supports the Bermuda swell, and “not a hot thermal anomaly from a mantle plume,” according to their paper.

It’s a particularly intriguing finding, considering scientists believe the area was once part of the supercontinent Pangea, which formed hundreds of millions of years ago. Many other island chains in the Pacific or Indian oceans are the result of volcanic hotspots.

Frazer is now probing other islands around the world to see if other similarly unusual structures are lurking elsewhere.

“Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme,” he told Live Science, “and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in October, word started making the rounds of an AI startup called Doublespeed. Backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Doublespeed offers customers a unique service: access to a massive phone farm that could be used to operate hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts.

Now, 404 Media reports in an explosive scoop that Doublespeed has been hacked. This wasn’t just one account associated with the startup, but the entire backend used to manage its phone farm — so it provides an extraordinary glimpse at how the service is actually being used to manipulate social media at scale.

Speaking to 404 on condition of anonymity, the hacker said they can “see the phones in use, which manager [computers controlling the phones] they had, which TikTok accounts they were assigned, proxies in use (and their passwords), and pending tasks. As well as the link to control devices for each manager.”

The hacker also shared a list of over 400 TikTok accounts operated by Doublespeed’s phone farm, about half of which were actively promoting products. Most of them, the publication reports, did so without disclosing that the posts were ads — a direct violation of TikTok’s terms of use, not to mention the Federal Trade Commission’s digital advertising regulations.

While undisclosed ads might seem like small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, the speak to a bleak trend. Not only is Doublespeed a possible breeding ground for disinformation campaigns or financial scams, but they seem to be getting away with their phone farm operation without any pushback from TikTok.

Doublespeed’s TikTok accounts ran a gamut of different cons, promoting language learning apps, supplements, massage products, dating apps and more. One account, operating under the unambiguously human-sounding name of Chloe Davis, had uploaded some 200 posts featuring an AI-generated woman hawking a massage roller for a company called Vibit, 404 reported.

Though the hacker says he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31, he notes that he still had access to the company’s back end as recently as today.

So far, Doublespeed is only active on TikTok, though it has plans to expand to Instagram, Reddit, and X-formerly-Twitter. When it does, it seems all bets are off — with social media engagement, and all the influence it entails, being relegated to the highest bidder.

            <h2>AI Sends School Into Lockdown After It Mistook a Student’s Clarinet for a Gun</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-surveillance-school-clarinet">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at Lawton Chiles Middle School in Florida were sent scrambling into lockdown last week, after an alert from an AI surveillance system detected a student carrying a gun.

There’s just one issue: the “gun” was actually a band student’s clarinet.

The whole thing unraveled quickly, according to local reporting. When the alert went out, it triggered an automatic “code red,” giving administrators no choice but to react to the AI system’s decision.

Luckily nobody was hurt, and local police soon declared the lockdown over. “The code red was a precaution and the children were never in any danger,” local police wrote in a Facebook post.

In a message to parents, school Principal Dr. Melissa Laudani said the district has “multiple layers of school safety, including an automated system that detects potential threats. A student was walking in the hallway, holding a musical instrument as if it were a weapon, which triggered the code red to activate.” (It’s not known what exactly constitutes a “code red,” as it isn’t mentioned in the school’s latest Parent Student handbook.)

Rather than blame the faulty AI system for the commotion — without which the fiasco never would have happened in the first place — the school blamed the young clarinetist.

“While there was no threat to campus, I’d like to ask you to speak with your student about the dangers of pretending to have a weapon on a school campus,” Laudani wrote.

It’s not known what particular system Lawton Chiles has on overwatch, but the fact that it can’t differentiate between a clarinet with 17 keys and a rifle with none is concerning.

The Lawton Chiles incident comes soon after another similar case, in which AI led to the violent detention of a 16-year old teen in Baltimore by at least eight officers with guns drawn. In that case, the school’s AI had somehow misidentified a small bag of Doritos for a handgun, prompting a heavily armed response from city police.

Like the story from Lawton Chiles, the Baltimore false positive could’ve easily been prevented had a human being been in the loop. Instead, it seems both systems allowed the AI to make the call without any challenge from a human being.

Omniilert, the company behind the Dorito incident, insisted that its AI system “functioned as intended: to prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification.”

It all underscores just how important it is that these AI school surveillance systems actually work before they’re forced into schools — because when it comes to identifying students with guns, false positives can be just as deadly as a false negatives.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/instacarts-ai-driven-pricing-tool-attracted-attention-now-the-ftc-has-questions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Reuters, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.

The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.

Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.

But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.

For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like pretty much every other tech company in existence, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI over the past several years. The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including Firefly — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s SlimLM program.

Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It states that SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset” released by Cerebras in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.

Lyon’s lawsuit, which was originally reported on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”

“Books3” — a huge collection of 191,000 books that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, a lawsuit against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to train its Apple Intelligence model. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce also claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes.

Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next administrator of NASA. The private astronaut and founder of the Shift4 payments processing platform will now be in charge of an agency that faces great uncertainty under President Trump.

Isaacman’s confirmation comes a little over a year after Trump nominated him. It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming concerned about the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump was reportedly aware of when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)

That led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman.

The billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the moon. SpaceX has a contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface, though Duffy had threatened to revoke that contract, and encouraged Jeff Bezos’ rival company Blue Origin to try to beat Musk’s effort.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last Saturday, an Islamic State infiltrator ambushed a meeting between American soldiers and their local counterparts in a Syrian desert town. Two members of the Iowa National Guard and a U.S. civilian interpreter were killed in the assault—whose perpetrator may or may not have known that the subject of the meeting was how to counter ISIS.

The incident didn’t just illustrate the danger of extremists hiding within Syria’s new security forces. It points to a broader problem: Outside of the country’s capital, there is still virtually no state in Syria, and the obstacles to building a new one—poverty, social and religious divisions, foreign interference—are so large that the effort could take decades.

Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former al-Qaeda leader who is now Syria’s president, had 30,000 soldiers at his command when he toppled the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad a year ago—a small fraction of what he needed to control all of Syria. Since then, he has been directing a state-building effort that would be daunting even if his country were not destitute and littered with rubble. He must recruit and vet tens of thousands of new security forces into a new government whose leaders once espoused an ISIS-style militancy, but are now committed to overcoming it.

Read: The dispute behind the violence in Syria

The ancient desert town where the Americans were killed, Palmyra, illustrates the limits of the new state’s remit. Hours from the capital by way of loosely patrolled roads, Palmyra is a former Roman trading post whose ruins were once among Syria’s most celebrated tourism sites. But the town was controlled by ISIS at times during Syria’s civil war, and the economy remains moribund. Saturday’s attack will not help to lure tourists back. The new government is thinly staffed in Palmyra and still struggles to build relationships with locals. A recent influx of former residents and displaced people has made the town easy for extremists to infiltrate.

Under the circumstances, Sharaa has done a remarkable job of maintaining a semblance of order and rallying international support for his country. He won the enthusiastic support of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly praised and endorsed him as a “young, attractive guy” with a “real shot at pulling it together.” During his visit to Washington, D.C., in November, Sharaa officially joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. Although Trump promised “very serious retaliation” for the killing of the three Americans last week, he did not hint at any retreat from Syria, where the United States now has about 1,000 troops.

Sharaa spent years gradually purging the more extreme elements from his coalition before the fall of the Assad regime. And his government takes the ISIS threat seriously. After the three Americans were killed, a Syrian government spokesperson said that the infiltrator—who was shot and killed after he opened fire—had been suspected of extremist sympathies during an evaluation and was about to be dismissed from the security forces. He appears to have been a longtime member of ISIS who joined the new security forces after the fall of the Assad regime, according to Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute who has written extensively on jihadism.

Still, Sharaa’s loyalties have long been a subject of intense speculation. Jerome Drevon, an analyst with the International Crisis Group and a co-author of a recent book on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the militia Sharaa led, told me he is confident that Sharaa and his top advisers now prioritize politics over theology and have fully embraced the idea that they must ally with the United States and other Western countries. But that is not necessarily true of the Sunni factions that still form an important part of their political base.

Graeme Wood: The most effective antidote to ISIS attacks

For Sharaa, the result is a difficult balancing act. He must placate Western supporters who are concerned about the safety of Syria’s religious minorities and the danger of Islamist militancy. At the same time, he has to retain the loyalty of the Sunni fighters who brought him to power, and whose most extreme members have been involved in massacring members of Syria’s beleaguered religious minorities.

“Now the leaders are favoring political considerations over religious ones,” Drevon said. “But your people were originally recruited and trained on religious principles. They were told that it was religiously forbidden to ally with the West, and now the government says the U.S. is our new partner.”

Some of Sharaa’s former supporters left his movement when he began moving away from a jihadist perspective, and they, along with a number of Islamist ideologues, have condemned him as a traitor. These disappointed radicals will remain an ideological threat to Sharaa’s new government whether or not they decide to take up arms or join ISIS.

“There is real fear about this within the leadership,” Drevon said, “and they are doing everything they can to contain it.”</div>

Is ISIS back? In late 2014, the jihadist group made its medieval views infamous using modern methods of propaganda. The organization had recently captured significant territory in Syria and Iraq, and claimed religious authority over all Muslims. The internet educated the world on the harsh, simple rules of a caliphate, and the surreal brutality of the beheading video. When the Islamic State lost control of its Middle Eastern territories some five years later, the group largely dropped out of the headlines. It had been defeated, but it didn’t disappear.

This week, ISIS reemerged in connection with two disparate acts of violence thousands of miles apart. Two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria by a man the Pentagon says is affiliated with ISIS. A day later, at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, two men opened fire at a Hanukkah celebration, killing 15 and wounding dozens. The men had homemade ISIS flags in their car, and had recently traveled to an area in the Philippines where ISIS-affiliated groups are known to still be active. Are these incidents connected? And do they point to a group that’s evolving?

Our guest this week, the Atlantic staff writer Graeme Wood, reported extensively on ISIS during its heyday. He compares the group to a trick birthday candle, capable of reigniting quickly. Wood explains the new patterns and, as we learn more about the motivations of the Bondi Beach shooters, what the world might expect going forward.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: A decade ago, ISIS was infamous worldwide. At its peak, in 2014, the jihadist group controlled territory in Iraq and Syria roughly the size of Kentucky. It declared itself a caliphate, with authority over Muslims everywhere. Hard to forget from that period were the beheading videos, which ISIS released as a twisted form of propaganda.

Five years later, the group lost control of that territory. And then, for the most part, we didn’t hear much about them. ISIS disappeared from the headlines—until this week.

In Syria, someone the Pentagon believes is affiliated with ISIS killed two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter. And then, of course, Bondi Beach, in Australia: A father and son killed 15 people at a Hanukkah celebration. They were found to have homemade ISIS flags in their car, and they’d also recently traveled to the southern Philippines, which has seen Islamist violence for years.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. And today: Is ISIS back?

Graeme Wood: It’s sort of like a self-lighting birthday candle, where you blow it out, and it looks like it’s out, but then the little spark is enough to reignite it. And so what we’re seeing right now is the reignition, after some years, of a spark in this one place. And it’s gonna be really difficult to find out the other places where another spark has not been totally extinguished and could come back and reignite.

Rosin: Staff writer Graeme Wood has traveled the world—throughout the Middle East, the Philippines, and even Australia—in order to interview ISIS members and supporters.

In 2016, he wrote a book about the group, The Way of the Strangers: Encounters With the Islamic State. He’s kept an eye on ISIS ever since.

Today, he talks to us about how, in the years after the group’s defeat, ISIS never really went away and about what the recent violence might mean.

Wood: What’s always interesting with these attacks—’cause some people can be sort of fanboys of ISIS, and they carry the icons of ISIS with them but don’t know much about it. These people traveled to Mindanao in the southern Philippines, which we don’t hear that much about in the Americas, because we think of ISIS, in its heyday, as being centered in Syria, which it was. But ISIS had this brilliant idea of kind of bringing in affiliates, where they would find groups that were already Islamist in some way, maybe not Islamist in exactly the same way as ISIS, but they would bring them on and get what they called pledges of loyalty, or baya’a, from them.

And in the Philippines, they found an excellent target, which was a group called Abu Sayyaf, which was already fighting against the Philippine government, was already Islamist, and that just needed a little bit of help from ISIS central command to kind of go pro and join the big leagues of international global jihadism.

And that’s what happened in 2014, was that Abu Sayyaf became part of the ISIS network after operating as a local jihadist group for over a decade in the southern Philippines. And back in 2014, 2015, some of the people who I interviewed at great length in Australia, they were supporters of ISIS who didn’t even consider going to Syria. They went to, or tried to go to, the southern Philippines because that’s where they thought the center of gravity was.

And that’s exactly where the two alleged killers in Bondi Beach—one of whom’s dead, and the other one is just waking up from a coma right now—where they went about a month before the attack. So that’s awfully suspicious.

Rosin: All right, so you’ve been to Mindanao. Walk me through what happens there. And we’ll caveat this by saying we don’t have details about what this duo actually did there or who they met with quite yet, but what did you learn when you were reporting in Mindanao?

Wood: I went to Mindanao in the southern Philippines in 2016, and I was looking for ISIS activity, and that’s what I found. There was a very heavy Philippine military contingent that was doing counterterrorism operations there because they knew that ISIS was operating at such strength that it would actually control territory. There would be villages that would come under its control temporarily, and then there were areas that it controlled permanently.

And it took another year or so until the Philippine government really started to get the upper hand. And they claim to have eliminated it, but, of course, there are still attacks going on. And if you are in that part of the world—that is, Asia—and you want to go and find ISIS activity and hook up with ISIS people, then that’s probably where you would go, and that’s where the two killers in Bondi Beach seem to have gone.

Rosin: And that remains true to this day—’cause you’re describing a trip that happened about eight years ago, but you’re saying that the activity has continued.

Wood: Yeah, so ISIS has sort of two operational modes. The first one is where they control territory, and they can implement Islamic law as they see it. The second mode is where they’re attempting to get that territory. And up until 2017, it actually controlled that territory and could do their ISIS thing.

Since then, they’ve been in this other mode where they’re more like an insurgency. So if these two guys went there and connected with ISIS there, then they were connecting with people who were in military mode rather than governance mode. And if they came back, they came back with instructions in that regard.

Rosin: Okay, so what details do we actually have about their trip there, just to be clear?

Wood: Yeah, we have confirmation from the government of the Philippines that they arrived, what their citizenships were and their names, which pretty much narrows down that it was actually them, and that they went listing their destination as Davao City, which is the largest city in Mindanao and not a city that has ever been controlled by, or even come close to being controlled by, ISIS. But it is the gateway to the south of the Philippines, where there are places that have been controlled by ISIS, and we don’t know where they went from Davao.

There are innocent reasons to go to Davao, and there are very sinister reasons. And the fact that these guys perpetrated a mass killing, it appears, when they came back, of course, makes us think that the sinister reasons are the ones that apply.

Rosin: Right, okay, so now we’re in speculation territory, but if you had to speculate, what is the picture that you would put together? Fill in the dots: What would actually happen to them there that would aid them in committing this act? This is speculation, but—

Wood: We do have to speculate, of course. Neither of these guys is a trained soldier or gunman, so even getting a little bit of tactical training could be helpful to them. The dad, I believe, was a fruit salesman—“fruiterer,” as they call them in Australian. And the son was an out-of-work bricklayer. So neither of these guys kill people for a living.

And you can see in the videos that they’re moving around somewhat competently—not totally incompetently. Remember, one of them had his weapon taken away by another fruiterer, actually. And so that doesn’t suggest that he was the most competent person.

But if you go to the Philippines, and you connect with people who have been fighting for a while, then you can get ideological connection, you can get military training, and then you can come back being a bit more deadly than you would’ve been had you not gone there.

Rosin: So that’s these two guys in this very specific training. I wanna broaden out to get a little bit more of the context.

So going back to Australia: There have been this series of anti-Semitic incidents in the country—a kosher deli in Sydney, a synagogue in Melbourne that were set on fire last year, homes and cars in largely Jewish neighborhoods in Sydney were vandalized with anti-Semitic hate speech, another Melbourne synagogue was set on fire back in July, and now this attack. Do experts see these events as connected or related to what happened in Bondi Beach? How do you put that bigger picture together?

Wood: Well, Bondi Beach is part of the eastern suburbs of Sydney, where it’s just known—it’s a center of Jewish community and residential communal life. So if there’s gonna be a background level of anti-Semitic violence, which there unquestionably has been since 2023, then that is going to be expected to be one of the areas where you’re gonna see that. And indeed, that’s where you have. You mentioned the firebombing of a deli, but there’s also things like cars that are being destroyed mysteriously in these neighborhoods. And I think a lot of Australian Jews and residents in that area, very reasonably, see this as part of an anti-Semitic crime wave.

Now, the origins of it are a bit hazier, and there’s reasons to think that there might be independent origins of some of these attacks. In the case of the firebombing of the deli in Bondi Beach in 2024 and of the synagogue in Melbourne, the Australian government has just come out and said, This is done with the direction of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is a really bold statement to make—to accuse a foreign government of doing that. And they, in fact, expelled the ambassador of Iran as a result of this, a very, very high-level step. So that’s one kind of flow of these incidents.

The other, though, seems to be different. These two guys, there’s speculation of whether they are directed by Iran, but most of the evidence is suggesting that they’re directed by the Islamic State, which is an enemy of Iran that has fought the Islamic Republic of Iran on several fronts. And so it would be weird if they were cooperating with Iran. What, instead, you’ve got is multiple forms of jihadism that, in the last couple years, seem to be directed mostly at Australian Jews.

Rosin: That’s very helpful ’cause I’m trying to disentangle these different patterns, see which ones are related, and how they’re related. But ISIS hasn’t specifically targeted only Jewish groups in the past, so how do you make sense of the specific targeting of a Jewish celebration and Jewish targets? What is that change about?

Wood: Yeah, Hanna, you make a really important point here. If you looked at the focus of ISIS activity in the past, you would not see a lot of attacks on Jewish groups or on Israel. So many different horrible attacks that I could name in the history of ISIS, very few of them focused on Israel. And if you asked ISIS why, they told me pretty directly, Look, our focus is on Muslim apostates. They are closer to us. We hate them more. And in our apocalyptic view of the world, there’s a kind of drumbeat of an order of operations that we’re looking at, and Israel doesn’t enter the picture until pretty late in the game. Jews are not the ones we’re attacking.

But obviously, that’s changed. So in 2016 or so, you would’ve seen ISIS fighting Iran, fighting Iraqi Shia, fighting Kurds in Iraq. That was one of the main areas of operation and targets—almost nothing in Israel. So what’s happened, I think, in the meantime, is ISIS has lost territory, and Iran has lost relative power ’cause some of its proxies have been taken apart. And now, there’s a different focus because ISIS has changed, and its enemies have changed. And Israel—and by extension, Jews in general—are in the crosshairs.

Wood: I think that ISIS, like any group, reads the news. What occurs to them to attack is not always because they have an apocalyptic order of operations, but also because they see what motivates people, what excites people. And since October 7, 2023, the main cause that is likely to animate ordinary people—or ordinary people who are ISIS-curious, at least—is Gaza, is Israel, and again, by extension, any random Jew who’s just celebrating a holiday. So not too surprising that there would be just a background level of anti-Semitic attacks and also a specific focus on Jews by Islamic State supporters.

Rosin: After the break: Why Australia? And how does Bondi Beach connect with the attacks on American soldiers in Syria?

Rosin: So a few broader questions about ISIS. I do think of ISIS as operating mainly in their own territories, so why are they carrying out attacks in Australia?

Wood: Back in 2014, when ISIS was in the headlines for its activity in Syria, I went to Australia, and I asked supporters there, What do you care about? What’s important to you about this, and what makes you so crazy? And they were pretty clear. They said, We’ve got territory now. We have a place where we can implement Islamic law, and that’s what matters to us. We need to take the version of Islam that we believe in and turn it into a state.

And so how does it help them to do that if you blow up a random place in Australia? Not much. In fact, it might stop them from being able to do that effectively in Syria if they start attacking elsewhere, because the rest of the world won’t put up with it, and they’ll be deprived of their sanctuaries in Syria.

So now we’re in a very different situation, and ISIS is too. ISIS had that territory that it wanted to jealously protect where it could implement Islamic law, and now it doesn’t. And so when times change, ISIS’s strategy changes.

And so they focus, first of all, on the places where they do have some territory, and that’s in Nigeria, a little bit of territory in Mozambique. But everywhere else, they’re now more in a terrorist mode of attacking elsewhere, so you see smaller attacks. And all those people in Australia who are the friends and descendants of those who I interviewed 10 years ago about ISIS, those people now have different priorities. They have no Syria to go to, and so they’re thinking more about what they can do at home. And it seems to be the case with these two, if their having an ISIS flag in their car is any indication, that they’ve decided that the way that they can help the cause is to attack Jews in their own country of Australia.

I think in the heyday of ISIS, eight to 10 years ago, we in the West—and that includes Australia—were, in a sense, spared some of the worst because, of course, the bad things were happening over there. People were focused on getting over there. And the fact that there was an “over there” to get to made people very excited about the cause. There were a lot of people who said, Wow, we thought it would be a hundred years before there was a new caliphate that we could fight for, and so we’re really energized about this.

Well, there’s no more caliphate, so the energy from having a caliphate is now depleted. But there’s still a lot of people who are focused on building a caliphate and supporting the pathetic little territory that the caliphate still retains. And those people aren’t going away.

Not much has happened on the whole—there’s not an attack in Bondi Beach like this every year, thank goodness. But we should expect a lot of the Islamic State supporters, who in the past have been focused on trying to travel to Islamic State territory and be Muslims there, that is gonna be an energy that’s directed inward. There’s nowhere for them to attack except for where they stand, whether that be in Poland, Germany, Paris, or Bondi Beach.

Rosin: Yeah, what I’m taking from this is that those of us who are not close watchers of ISIS like you, we just assumed it had gone away, or we just weren’t thinking about it. It wasn’t in the headlines. The caliphate died. That’s the end of it. But what you’re describing is a completely different global picture.

Wood: Yeah, ISIS, one thing that it really had going for it ideologically was a certain kind of simplicity. And as long as you have that simplicity, it’s possible for people to rediscover them, even long after ISIS has ceased to be on the front page of every newspaper.

Rosin: Okay, there’s one more piece of this puzzle that we haven’t discussed, which is the Bondi Beach attack happened just a day after two U.S. soldiers and an interpreter were killed in Syria by the man the Pentagon says is affiliated with ISIS. What do we know about the killing, how is it related to everything we’ve been talking about, and what does it signal to you?

Wood: There is a connection with Bondi Beach in that the Islamic State has done the attacks in Syria, and it appears that these two people in Bondi Beach are Islamic State as well. But Syria’s a pretty different operational space—and you have to go all the way back to 2013.

The current government of Syria and ISIS were basically the same thing back then, and then they split. And the current government of Syria is now an ex-jihadist movement that has been attacking the Islamic State, with the cooperation of the United States.

So what we’re seeing is that ISIS no longer has the upper hand in any part of Syria and that it has to infiltrate parts of the security services to get close enough to the partners of the current government and attack them. And that’s what it seems like they did effectively this weekend, was get someone that was close enough to some American soldiers and then shoot them dead.

Rosin: Right, right, so that is a constant danger for the U.S. soldiers who are still there: the possibility of someone from ISIS who’s an enemy of the current government and an enemy of the current government’s allies sneaking in and causing mayhem.

Wood: Yes. And to do that, they don’t have to get a plane ticket to do it. These are Syrians. The leadership of the current government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were personally acquainted back in the day, so it’s not like these are people who have to be brought in from abroad to infiltrate. They are just Syrians who were there and who have ISIS sympathies and have to be screened for—in this case, I guess, unsuccessfully—because they’re trying to do ISIS stuff within Syrian territory, which is, to say, their own home territory.

Rosin: Understood. So it’s especially dangerous because you can’t entirely tell who’s affiliated with whom, who’s pretending. It’s a nuanced situation.

Wood: Yes, that’s right. And it cuts both ways too. Given that these are Syrians, the current government is filled with people who know them, that means they can sniff ’em out better. So there are ups and downs to it, but the fact of the matter is that Syria has had lots of ISIS supporters within it for a long time. And so, when you flip the government to being a Sunni government that’s anti-ISIS, then you’re gonna have a bunch of Sunni extremists who you have to keep an eye on and make sure they haven’t wriggled their way into the security services and gotten close to the Americans.

Rosin: So in the coming days, weeks, I’m sure we’ll get more information about the Bondi Beach attackers, their travels, their motivations. What is it that you’ll be looking for? What details will be important to you?

Wood: In the past, with Islamic State attacks, the people who have done them have not been shy about saying why, and the fact that they’re shooting into a crowd of Jewish families, you can make some pretty obvious inferences about their general view of Jews. But finding out, “What, really, is motivating you? What are you trying to get out of this?”—in the past, they’ve been willing to say that; they’ve even recorded videos of themselves explaining that beforehand.

So in the coming days, I wanna hear what the travel of these two people looks like in the Philippines and also just whether the survivor has a statement to make about why he was doing this and what motivated him, because that’s gonna tell us a lot about some of the most important stuff here, which is: Was there help from the outside? Was there help from the Islamic State in the Philippines? There’s speculation that there was help from Iran. And this becomes a very different situation if it turns out that there’s outside help, and it’s a directed attack rather than what they sometimes call an “inspired” one.

Rosin: And what is the difference? An inspired attack versus a directed attack, what’s the significance of that distinction?

Wood: Some of the distinction is geopolitical. If it turns out that Iran has told these people what to do, made sure that they were funded to do it, then that could mean direct strikes against Iran by Israel. There’s some discussion of that already.

Now, if it turns out that they were directed in the attack from the southern Philippines, then it could mean a new wave of counterterror operations there, which I think it’s unlikely that would include Australian forces in the southern Philippines, but it would certainly mean some probably pretty bloody operations and a renewal of hostilities in the southern Philippines, with the Philippine government against Islamic State people there.

If it turns out that these people just got it in their head that this would be a good idea, and nobody told them how to do it, where to do it, when to do it, then you’re back to the long-term counterterror questions that Australia’s had to think about and has not thought about, I think, hard enough over the last few years.

If you have lots of people in your territory, including your own citizens who think that violence is the answer, who think that random killing of civilians is the answer, then you gotta deal with that. And, obviously, Australia has not been able to do that, given what we’ve seen in the number of violent attacks against Jews in the last couple years.

The soul searching’s barely begun there, but the recriminations have also barely begun.

Rosin: I have to admit—I haven’t thought about ISIS in a long time, which I imagine is true of a lot of people. It does feel like, from what you’re describing, that there’s a return of sorts or an evolution, but I also don’t wanna overstate it, since there’s a lot we don’t know about the attack in Australia. So how do you think about the fact that ISIS-linked killings are in the news again, that even though the term ISIS is in the news again?

Wood: I think a lot of people who watch ISIS closely would say, Oh, they never left. And it’s true that there’s been a thousand, couple thousand ISIS attacks worldwide over the last several years, long since ISIS has been out of the news.

But I think about it in a slightly different way. I think it’s also that ISIS’s inspiration has never gone away for some people. ISIS had such a clear message of: We’re going to reestablish the caliphate. The caliphate is this thing that you, as a Muslim who knows anything at all about his history, it’s something that you’ve read about, and our business is bringing it back. So it’s so simple that you can teach people about this, they can learn about it just by reading online about it, and so it’s constantly going to be inspiring a few people, and a few of those people are going to end up being violent.

So I think ISIS, in some sense, never went away. And, in some sense, the ideas are very, very difficult to just get rid of, and as long as they’re out there, occasionally, you’re gonna see attacks like this. It doesn’t mean that there’s gonna be a return to the volume of ISIS attacks that we saw in 2014, ’15, ’16, where there would be hundreds of people killed in churches, theaters, etc. But it does mean that these ideas, they turn out to be very resilient, and long after we forgot about them, other people have remembered them.

Rosin: Well, Graeme, thank you so much for helping us understand the situation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Zane Lowe, the most important music interviewer working today, kicked his sneakers up onto his couch cushions and began to cry.

For the previous two hours, I’d been asking the 52-year-old global creative director of Apple Music about problems facing the record industry: growing fears about AI; broad discontent with streaming pay rates; the ambient suspicion that music doesn’t matter as much as it used to. Lowe is famous for the high-energy earnestness he shows on his internet radio show, where he often rains intricately worded praise down on artists while tossing in a boom sound effect for punctuation. He’d answered my questions with that same jittery jolliness, but he seemed, eventually, to want to redirect the conversation—back to the power of music itself.

He picked up the remote control for his office speakers and cued up a song from the indie-folk artist Keaton Henson called “You Don’t Know How Lucky You Are.” The song’s lyrics tenderly address a long-lost lover, and the music builds from quiet guitar harmonics to a rustling crescendo. As we listened mostly in silence, Lowe laid back in his Peter Pan–green sweater, looking pained. “That’s the real stuff, man,” he said when the song was over, wiping tears from his eyes. “That’s the good shit. That’s why we do it!”

This emotional display helped answer the question I’d really been pondering: how a Gen X DJ and former rapper from New Zealand became the record industry’s favorite influencer. At a time when social media allows artists to whittle the promotional cycle down to a few Instagram posts and a Hot Ones appearance, Lowe reliably books press-shy A-listers—Taylor Swift, Thom Yorke, Tyler the Creator—for in-depth exchanges that circulate widely and define the narrative around major releases. These conversations tend to invert the ostensible purpose of celebrity interviews. Rather than serve the public’s curiosities, he said, he wants to serve artists—to give them “a place for them to learn a little bit more about themselves.”

That chummy ethos is everywhere in cultural media these days, especially across podcasting, but Lowe—who was known for his long-form chats with artists at BBC Radio 1 before he joined Apple Music upon its launch in 2015—helped popularize it. “He’s largely responsible for the new and relaxed way artists interview,” the pop singer Halsey told me in an email. “When broadcast radio was starting to decline and long before podcasts had taken over as the primary source of information sharing, there was Zane Lowe in a cozy sweater saying ‘I’m your friend, your fan, and I want you to tell me how you really feel.’” Though the conversations aren’t journalistic, they can be quite revealing about craft and the artist’s inner life. Sampha, a soft-spoken alternative-pop singer, marveled to me about the “never-ending tap of insight” coming out of Lowe. “There’s always substance behind what he’s saying—even if he’s speaking fast.”

Opinions among music listeners are more mixed. Many viewers rave about the kindness Lowe extends to their favorite artists. But to others, he’s a cheerleader for the stagnant, idolatrous record industry—someone who’d rather give a fluffy compliment than ask a pressing question. In a 2024 episode of the Pop Pantheon podcast, the critic DJ Louie XIV called Lowe a “sycophant” running the “pop-music equivalent of Fox News.” Louie’s producer, Russ Martin, added, “It is just frankly not believable that he likes every record and he likes every song on every record.”

I enjoy Lowe’s work more than that—he’s clearly smart and often amusing, and he cares a ton about the art form. Yet I, too, have wondered about his sincerity: What kind of music geek doesn’t harbor some critical opinions? But one colleague, the radio host Eddie Francis, told me Lowe refuses to speak ill of artists even when off mic, even jokingly. Another, the Apple executive Oliver Schusser, who oversees music, told me he couldn’t remember Lowe disliking anything while on the job—ever. His positivity is so committed that it almost feels rooted in fear, as though our musical era would look, without his boosting, quite sad.

Commercial radio in New Zealand—as in many places worldwide—used to be controlled by the government, which had determined that the public interest was best served by a diet of classical music and weather reports. In 1966, Lowe’s father, a young DJ, set out on a fishing boat with five friends in order to break that monopoly. Three miles off the coast of Auckland, in international waters, the crew began broadcasting rock and roll to the mainland. The so-called pirate radio station was part of a global “fight for independence of taste and communication for a generation,” Lowe said.

But that exciting life in broadcasting meant Lowe’s father was gone for much of his childhood. His parents entered a prolonged separation when he was young, and Lowe coped by obsessing over songs and bands—so much that his own friends found it grating. He asked himself the question that, he said, he’s struggled with for decades: “Why does enthusiasm, a lot of support, translate as overenthusiasm, or annoying, or cringe, or just ingenuine?”

Lowe’s enthusiasm did prove helpful to his professional aspirations—both as a rapper and beat maker (who contributed to hits that are still considered classics of Kiwi hip-hop) and as a DJ climbing the ranks of music media locally and abroad. In the late ’90s, he moved to the United Kingdom and became an MTV presenter. By 2003, he was anchoring BBC Radio 1’s vaunted nightly pop segment, where he helped break acts such as Adele and Arctic Monkeys. His Radio 1 show “was the sound of a generation” in the U.K., Christopher Tubbs, a DJ and longtime friend of Lowe’s, told me. “Tastemaker doesn’t quite cover it.”

But soon, the idea of the tastemaker was being undermined. The launch of Spotify in 2008 meant that listeners could now hear almost anything they wanted on demand, guided by personalized recommendation algorithms. Lowe’s fame was rising because of headline-making interviews with Kanye West, Jay-Z, and other rappers, but radio’s salience was declining. When Apple began working on its own streaming service, Lowe joined a star-studded leadership team that also included the record producer Jimmy Iovine and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor.

Apple had revolutionized music listening with iTunes and the iPod, but the company was late to streaming. Reputationally, the tech was a risk; Spotify’s rise had triggered complaints from artists who felt like the new system’s ease and cheapness devalued their art. “The idea that everyone would have the same jukebox in the sky, completely virtual, terrified some of us,” Schusser said. “Does it actually make music a little bit like, I don’t know, tap water?”

Apple’s answer to the perceived issues with streaming was to market itself as a prestigious, boutique alternative to Spotify. The two services are functionally identical in many ways, allowing users to explore mostly the same pool of music using mostly the same tools. But just as Apple TV has tried to compete with Netflix by funding highbrow dramas cast with movie stars, Apple Music has invested in signifiers of old-school quality—such as human-curated radio stations.

Sitting on the wraparound couch that circles the studio, I watched a parade of musicians come in and out all morning for two days in a row. The K-pop boy band Cortis arrived with an entourage of handlers and bopped around to their own music; the trance DJ Armin van Buuren got stony-serious on the topic of his new, piano-only album. Throughout all of Lowe’s platitudes and boosterism, my attention was rapt, and my mind never wandered. His continual gush of questions, compliments, and observations creates spectacle in the manner of a top-tier inspirational speaker.

Still, I wondered whom this spectacle was for. Lowe’s previous employers, MTV and Radio 1, were, at their height, essential hubs for anyone trying to plug into pop culture. Apple’s radio shows compete for ears with its streaming efforts, whose abundance has helped diminish the sense of a musical common ground. When I first started using Apple Music in 2015, I quickly forgot about its radio tab—other than when a clip of Lowe would cross my social feeds. His interviews tend to get views on YouTube in proportion with the popularity of the featured artists; as for the radio show itself, all that Lowe would say about its reach is that it was growing. “Any artist will tell you right now, the trick is trying to find an audience,” he said.

The reason it’s so tricky is, of course, streaming and the attention economy. Standing out is not just harder than ever—the stakes are higher than ever because, as Lowe put it, “there’s an imbalance in the financials” due to the small payouts per listen. “You can work at a company and be proud of the work we do and be a part of this current model—and still feel like there’s things that you wish were different,” Lowe said. “Two things can be true.” The comment drove home that I’d been watching a deliberate anachronism: an attempt to treat “tap water” as artisanal, and to feign monoculture at a company that had helped break it up.

Lowe, however, is without obvious precedent. Celebrity interviewers have always played a promotional role and gotten cozy with their subjects, but it’s hard to think of an era-defining interviewer who didn’t at least have some bite. Kurt Loder? Nineties rockers withered under his jaded stare. Ryan Seacrest? He’s got that Hollywood-slick, smiling-but-shady thing going on. Oprah? She’ll ask the questions people want to know the answers to.

The closest pioneer of Lowe’s method might be one who walked into the studio when I was there: the 68-year-old rock journalist and film director Cameron Crowe, who was promoting his memoir, The Uncool. “I think we’re both people pleasers,” Lowe said to him. “Would you agree?”

Crowe’s trajectory in rock journalism is a modern myth thanks to his 2000 movie, Almost Famous, which is based on the same memories that he writes about in The Uncool. In the early ’70s, at just 15 years old, Crowe started writing for Rolling Stone, which gave him the chance to interview artists such as Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and the Allman Brothers Band. His role, he told Lowe, was to be a fan: “Take the journey with that artist. If they made an album that didn’t thrill you, don’t bail; stick with it.”

This approach clashed with other people’s ideals about the profession. The rock critic Lester Bangs once warned Crowe against becoming friends with the musicians he covers. “These are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of rock stars,” he said, according to The Uncool. “And they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it, right?” He later added, “You should make your reputation on being honest, and unmerciful.” Bangs’s advice, repeated in Almost Famous, is a touchstone for music journalists—a reminder that being too gentle or generous can destroy the very thing you’re covering.

But Lowe has followed Crowe’s philosophy, not Bangs’s. He thanked Crowe for allowing “people like myself to be more comfortable in the fact that I don’t really have a particularly strong critical muscle.” Later, in his office, Lowe told me that although critique is important, it’s not the role he was “born to inhabit.” At base, he wants his interviews to be “a document for fans to cherish and watch over and over and over again.”

That goal neatly aligns with the record industry’s shifting prerogatives. Music consumption has largely cleaved into two patterns: the passive, casual streamer who lets the algorithm serve up good-enough background listening, and the ultra-invested “stan,” who builds a fiercely rooted group identity around their favorite artists. The new playbook for success isn’t trying to appeal broadly—it’s monetizing and remonetizing the attention of diehards.

Even so, I couldn’t help but think that he and Crowe held too rosy a view of what fans really want, especially nowadays. If you put a superfan in a room with their favorite artist, they aren’t only going to flatter and fawn. They’re going to pry for information, no matter how awkwardly. At a press conference Lady Gaga held with her fans this year, for example, the first inquiry was about a spicy topic: her relationship with the rapper and notorious troll Azealia Banks, whom she had beefed with in the past.

Lowe’s job, however, isn’t simply to follow his curiosities, as a fan might. “Just being really honest—we work as a business,” he said. Money isn’t exchanged in the booking of interviews, but certain artists may be priorities for Apple because of economic considerations, such as their potential for streaming success. “It’s not just like, you know, the Zane Lowe Show taste playground,” he said.

Artists can put preconditions on the interviews and “respectfully request that the conversation doesn’t stray into areas that might be considered a bit too sensitive,” Lowe said. “I don’t mind that. I want to know where their spirit is.” They and their representatives also, every so often, ask to give input on the final edit.

He gestured to my voice recorder while explaining why he complied with such requests. “As somebody who’s obsessive-compulsive, very aware of wanting to be thoughtful with my thoughtfulness, I personally have no problem giving any artist grace to be at their best,” he said. “And in doing so, the truth is, we get more because they trust us.” He added, “I’m not interviewing heads of state, right?”

Some of his subjects do, however, hold statesmanlike influence. Swift, for example, is so prominent that Donald Trump regularly takes potshots at her—a fact no interviewer brought up in her recent press appearances. Lowe told me he’d been allowed to ask whatever he wanted, but the topic just hadn’t occurred to him. “If I think about What am I going to ask an artist like Taylor Swift in 10 minutes?, I could set sail onto the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat and be very directionless, very fast,” he said. “That is a strong tide of overthinking.”

Additionally, no interviewers had asked her why she issued more than 30 different versions of her new album—a strategy that, by beckoning fans to buy multiple copies, allowed her to sell a record-shattering 4 million copies in one week. Many commentators have criticized her rollout method as wasteful and exploitative, but Lowe saw it as a creative bid to do what musicians need to do right now: turn music into an event. He framed it as a win not only for Swift, but for the art form. “Isn’t it nice to be in 2025, to know there are new milestones, new things that music can achieve that it couldn’t before?” he said. “Because the other option is backwards.”

One part of his interview with her had broken ground, however. Lowe asked—amid a blizzard of rhetoric about the importance of human connection—how Swift had been processing the public reaction to The Life of a Showgirl. “The rule of show business is: If it’s the first week of my album release and you are saying either my name or my album title, you’re helping,” she replied. She added, later, “I have a lot of respect for people’s subjective opinions on art. I’m not the art police.” These quotes ricocheted around the internet, taken as a sign that Swift was well aware of how many fans and critics had panned the album. Lowe hadn’t mentioned that mixed reception, but he hadn’t needed to. Celebrities can be as online as any of us—they know what their detractors think.

It’s this reality that Lowe and the new music-promo circuit try to guard against. The background hum of digital life is negativity, polarization, and jaded disengagement; the record industry craves a forum to pitch its narratives before they’re torn to shreds in comment sections and mined for TikTok drama. A healthier artistic ecosystem wouldn’t—and in the past, didn’t—need the “safe place” that Lowe professes to provide.

That ecosystem seems unlikely to grow healthier as technology progresses. AI-generated songs have recently begun flooding streaming services; Spotify listeners can call upon an artificial DJ to deliver banter and commentary tailor-made for the user. When I brought up AI to Lowe, it was the first time I heard him express open contempt. “Leave the arts alone, dude. Like, go and fix other shit,” he said. Regarding the prospect of an AI hitmaker, he asked: “By the way, how do I interview that person?” His voice had been growing louder, occasionally hitting a near-shout.

Minutes later, before grabbing the remote control to play Keaton Henson’s song, he clapped his hands and stared me straight in the eyes. “Music is magic,” he said. “It guides us and helps us in moments subconsciously and consciously all the time. It’s such an important part of being human. It’s such an important part of our experience that I think, without meaning to, we let it evaporate into everything.”

By this point, the authenticity of his idealism was hardly in doubt, but the anxious process required to maintain it was becoming clearer. I didn’t need to be told that music is magic; I’d never really questioned it. Then I remembered what he’d told me about interviews: They’re for the benefit of the subject.</div>

Yes, this is not knew.  I look at my son&#39;s games on his desktop, with his RTX4070, 32 gig of ram, his 2K monitor, & I just do not see the graphics much better, if at all, than 15 years ago.   I was playing one of the Wolfenstein games, a game that cost me around $20, & my nephew was amazed over the graphics & wanted to know what I was playing.

$1000 for a video card one would expect that the graphics would be advancing better.  Fallout 4 was choppy using a RTX970.  Upgrading it to a 2070 made it

24 out of those 32 gigs of ram is probably needed to run Windows alone

Now that I&#39;ve loaded up with new black Friday specials, I will certainly encourage to buy used when possible.

Fallout 4 is just a total conversion mod for Skyrim. Its graphics couldn&#39;t be that great by definition.

All the games I want for the next 10 years are available on the PS4.  A long time ago I realized that used video game consoles were still as good as the day they were released yet they are a quarter of the price.  My kids buy new games yet when they saw me playing my 10 year old game they complemented on how nice the game was.  I guess graphics haven&#39;t come that far.Similar to TV that way. Graphics are overblown.
When digital and hi-def TV came out, I was like &quot;eh, seeing the actors&#39; pores isn&#39;t going to improve anything. Good plots and characterization would.&quot; And so it is with games as well.

It causes a rude audience and sticky floors?

Dual Shock 4 controllers are getting quite expensive though, a friend of mine is looking to buy a new one and they are twice the price as I saw them a few months ago.

The key is th way a long time beteeen upgrades. We just got a PS5 (not hooked up yet). My last console was a PS2. In comparison, the graphics and everything else should be amazing.

Anyone remember the fact that video games cause violence?

Have you noticed how much video games Koreans play?

Remember when it was as much of a fact as social media causing mental illness or AI hallucinating everything?

With the AI sucking all GPUs first and now RAM and SSD chips, hardware will get more expensive. And software pricing does not help. Yesterday I was browsing my Steam wrapped, and I only played 2% of games released in 2025. With new AAA games costing 80â or more (because of game passes and the like), I prefer playing grames from my backlog or buying good old games in sale.

Were you actually cost conscious or were you finding the joy of playing things from other years? I ask because I actually bought quite a few games this year, and so far having played only 2 of them, both indie titles, instead being enthralled by games released in 2023 and 2024.

I ask because even if you are cost conscious that isn&#39;t a reason for the 2%. Nearly all titles released this year were not AAA. Nearly all titles released this year did not cost $80. There&#39;s so many awesome games out there when you st

There&#39;s just a stack of pressures against hardware sales. The press has been brutal.

- Higher hardware prices- Microsoft seeming to lose interest in the XBox- High profile flops- Triple-A cancellations- 5 year into current hardware for PS5/XBox - if you want one you probably have it- Rising economic and financial uncertainty- Incoming generations used to small format gaming- Cost of living already too high for Gen Z, and not getting better.

I&#39;ve got a Series X, and I suspect it&#39;s the last console I&#39;ll own. And I&#39;ve had consoles since I used a Coleco Telstar to burn bars into the phosphor on a TV in the late 70s. I&#39;m aging out - and I&#39;m taking my money with me.

And honestly, I really bailed a couple of years ago. I had the MS Game Pass for a while, but I haven&#39;t bought a major title in at least three years, and I haven&#39;t spent a dime on XBox-related anything in 2025. The last thing I actually played on Game Pass was a 15 year old platformer called &quot;Limbo&quot;.

I&#39;ve had consoles since I used a Coleco Telstar to burn bars into the phosphor on a TV in the late 70s.That was my first console as well, except I got it in the 80s. I had the really big white contoured one.Gaming consoles just don&#39;t offer what they used to. It used to be they did things your PC couldn&#39;t. Now they&#39;re just a slightly discounted PC you&#39;re not allowed to run whatever you want on.

The only reason why we need new hardware these days is because the game studios are prioritising the speed of development and can&#39;t be arsed optimising their code.

- Hey, our engine is laggy.- Just bump the requirements, mate.

In the old times, video games were art - both in terms of ingenuity, art and code. The developers of old would try to squeeze as much as they could out of available hardware, and make their games run on as little resources as possible.

These days, no one gives a crap. It&#39;s all about dish

I&#39;m guessing this has something to do with the announcement of the GabeCube.

Several times more games than I&#39;ve ever bought before in my life.

Misread article. Didn&#39;t realize it was about hardware. My bad.

I did share! Got kid a PS5 with all the trimmings for Xmas.

PS5 Pro with thrust master wheel: 1100Optical drive $100Controller: $50Racing chair: $20015 games: $500Headset: $100Assorted stuff: $400

We didn&#39;t have a dedicated tv console before, just his Switch which is 2 years old and serves duty well. I just wanted something we could hook up to the 98&quot; tv full-time.

China can&#39;t really be expected to innovate because they lack the per-capita capital of the west which has a 100 year lead on technology vs. China. However Chinese immigrants educated in the West can innovate. For example every modern CPU uses a transistor type called &quot;FinFET&quot; which was invented by a person of Chinese descent. That&#39;s one example, there&#39;s of course many others.

Are you ragin&#39; cause you&#39;re a littler troll?

What do &quot;facts&quot; like the Tiananmen Square democracy protests matter, right?

Does Trump deny the boat attacks and put you in a re-education camp if you say they happened?

The gathering in Tiananmen Square was not primarily a pro-Democracy protest. It was a commemoration of the life and career of a recently deceased CCP official who had been promoting and bringing in reforms. The gathering was both to commemorate his life and to send a message to the CCP leadership that the people wanted his reforms to continue even though he was no longer alive to promote them. The pro-Democracy element inside the Square was only a small minority of the people there. The majority of the &#39;pro

Is your acknowledgment that there even was an incident enough to get you censored by the CCP?

How is China being micromanaged when there are now multiple independent starship competitors? Because they aren&#39;t independent.

How is China being micromanaged when there are now multiple independent starship competitors?

&quot;Their car industry is dominating the planet, etc.&quot;

If I say Tiananmen Square in a Chinese car will it brick itself?

They aren&#39;t clones, they are just the optimal shape. The USSR&#39;s Buran had similar claims made against it, but it was very different to the Shuttle. No main engines, larger, different mission profile, and much faster turn-around times. It&#39;s just that the best shape for a spaceplane is the shape that the Shuttle is, so every other one looks like a &quot;clone&quot; of it.

It&#39;s worse with China for some reason. I was reading today that they have apparently been testing a new far UV lithography machine that was &quot;reverse e

Not an actual starship clone. Minor detail, but not insignificant.

They forgot to add blockchain to the term &quot;AI rocket&quot;.

That would have increased their funding by at least 20%.

Maybe the next rocket startup which is copying SpaceX will mention that as well. /j

Repeating someone&#39;s stupid is the dumbest cargo cult imaginable.Starship is an idiotic system, it doesn&#39;t do anything useful for any purpose whatsoever except transferring money from the people&#39;s pockets through the government manipulation apparatus into the hands of Musk and his cronies, that&#39;s all.  The Chinese could really find a better way to waste money, I am sure of it.

The tech was either transferred or leaked.

When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.

I did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.

So that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.

Yes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.

At a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)

So Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.

On some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.

And so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”

When I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.

Before she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.

Miller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”

Miller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.

Weston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.

Glenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

As for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”

Miller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”

She worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.

Miller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.

The world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.

Aug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.

Aug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)

The interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”

Miller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.

After Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.

Back then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.

Miller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.

“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”

Multiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)

In 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.

“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.

Her ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”

The paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.

The Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”

After a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.

The circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”

Narratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.

And Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.

By the time Pam Bondi appeared on Miller’s podcast on Sept. 15, MAGA victimhood was cresting. It was five days after the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and the administration was determined to forge the killing into a broader narrative of anti-conservative persecution. There was discussion of the rising threat of antifa and left-wing political violence, of how Bondi survives “ugly, hateful” comments online and from in-person protesters, and of the LGBTQ agenda coming for America’s Christian children. “I think a lot of moms have come forward now, since they were putting this crazy ideology in our schools, these transgender books for elementary schools,” Bondi said. “They’re mama bears, and they’re coming out, and they’re going to run for office, and they’re going to become more vocal.” (Miller has also talked about how she pulled her daughter out of day care after the kids read a children’s book about gay penguins in New York’s Central Park Zoo.)

“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”

Miller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”

She continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”

After college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.

That soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.

She never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.

But before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”

The paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.

“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”

That part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”

But the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.

Britt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”

Miller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”

There is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.

The podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.

“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”

If I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)

Where is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?

It’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.

For right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?

And for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?

It is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.

The most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.

            <div id="article-text">NASA has a new administrator. Billionaire and space tourist Jared Isaacman was confirmed by the US Senate by a vote of 67 to 30.

Isaacman&#39;s path to the role was turbulent. Nominated by President Donald Trump in January, the nomination was abruptly cancelled in May after Trump fell out with Elon Musk - Isaacman was a SpaceX customer - and reinstated in November.

He inherits a troubled agency still reeling from a year of budget chaos that threatened major programs, though advocacy and congressional action helped save or restore funding for many missions that looked set for the axe.

Observers have welcomed Isaacman&#39;s arrival. In a statement, the Planetary Society said: &quot;After nearly a year of historic disruptions to the agency&#39;s workforce, facilities, and budget, Mr Isaacman has the opportunity to stabilize and reinvigorate the US space program.

&quot;Congress is on a path to provide Mr Isaacman with a restored budget that better funds national priorities: returning humans to the Moon, maintaining US leadership in space science and exploration, and training the next generation of scientists and aerospace engineers.&quot;

Over the last year, NASA has dealt with rounds of layoffs and resignations, resulting in a considerably reduced workforce and continued uncertainty over what role, if any, its centers around the US would play.

With Isaacman confirmed as NASA&#39;s 15th Administrator, all eyes are on the first moves he makes. A leaked paper he authored, Project Athena, proposed changes for the agency, including a move to &quot;science-as-a-service&quot; by paying commercial vendors for data and increasing private industry involvement. Isaacman has subsequently called the May document &quot;dated&quot;.

His SpaceX connections raise questions: he flew to orbit twice as a paying SpaceX customer, and Musk recommended him before the rift with Trump. Though Isaacman insists his plan &quot;never favored any one vendor,&quot; the optics are notable.

Critical challenges loom for the NASA Administrator. The next Artemis mission (a crewed free-return flight around the Moon) is due to launch as early as February. However meeting NASA&#39;s goal of landing humans on the Moon before China requires difficult decisions. SpaceX&#39;s Starship is behind schedule, and acting Administrator Sean Duffy&#39;s move to reopen the landing contract has yielded few viable alternatives.

As one space industry put it to El Reg: &quot;At last there is a NASA leader, but now we face the question of what direction will he take the space program.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An NHS tech supplier is investigating a cyberattack that affected its systems in the early hours of Sunday.

DXS International, which provides tools to NHS trusts to tackle appointment referral errors and prescriptions, disclosed the &quot;security incident&quot; to the London Stock Exchange on Thursday morning.

The attack affected its office servers but was immediately contained by its own IT staff, and those working for NHS England, the statement says.

A third-party digital forensics company is now investigating the case to understand the full scope and nature of the attack.

DXS says there was minimal impact on its products, and its frontline clinical services remained operational throughout.

&quot;The company has notified the relevant regulators, authorities, and law enforcement agencies, including the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office, and various NHS bodies, and is fully cooperating with their investigations.&quot;

The Register contacted both DXS and the NHS to understand the impact on patient care across the UK.

DXS does not publicly disclose how many NHS customers it supports in total, and it did not immediately respond to our questions.

However, its ExpertCare solution, used by clinicians to quickly understand prescription needs for cardiovascular diseases, is deployed widely.

According to the product&#39;s website, around 2,000 general practitioners, which oversee the care of around 17 million patients, use the software.

Its other program, BestPathway, does not list the number of customers it supports, and is being phased out for its replacement system, Next-Gen.

DXS said in its most recent financial report for the year ended April 2025 - in which it recorded revenues of £3.4 million ($4.5 million) - that it expects to secure many more customers in fiscal 2026/27.

It said upcoming NHS restructuring means that around 80 percent of its customers, many of whom have &quot;a significant number of GP practices&quot; not using BestPathway/Next-Gen, will look to standardize platforms, which &quot;represents a substantial revenue growth opportunity.&quot; ®

            <h2>React2Shell exploitation spreads as Microsoft counts hundreds of hacked machines</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/react2shell_exploitation_spreads_as_microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft says attackers have already compromised &quot;several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations&quot; via the React2Shell flaw, using the access to execute code, deploy malware, and, in some cases, deliver ransomware.

In a blog post this week, Redmond said attackers are actively exploiting CVE-2025-55182, better known as React2Shell, a critical flaw in React Server Components that can be abused to run arbitrary code on vulnerable servers.

According to Microsoft&#39;s threat intelligence team, exploitation has already spread well beyond the proof-of-concept stage, with hundreds of compromised systems confirmed across multiple sectors and regions.

The company said attackers are abusing the flaw to run arbitrary commands, drop malware, and pivot deeper into victim environments, often blending the activity into legitimate-looking application traffic.

React2Shell first burst into the open earlier this month, when researchers warned the React Server Components bug could be exploited to execute attacker-controlled code. The bug was quickly chained to other weaknesses and misconfigurations, with early campaigns linked to China and Iran-nexus threat activity that probed exposed servers at scale. A separate wave of disclosures days later revealed additional &quot;SecretLeak&quot; bugs in React tooling, further rattling developers who had only just begun to understand the blast radius of React2Shell.

Microsoft&#39;s latest findings suggest exploitation attempts ramped up rapidly after public disclosure, with attackers using successful exploits to push malware – including memory-based downloaders and cryptominers – onto exposed JavaScript application backends.

Other threat intelligence teams are seeing the same thing on the ground. Security firm S-RM said it has already responded to a real-world intrusion in which React2Shell was used as the initial access vector to breach a corporate network and deploy ransomware.

&quot;This is the first time S-RM has observed this vulnerability being used by financially motivated threat actors to facilitate a cyber extortion attack, and highlights an escalation in the known impact of this vulnerability compared to other public reporting, which has so far primarily documented instances of the vulnerability being used to introduce backdoor malware or cryptominers,&quot; the company said.

Telemetry also points to industrial-scale abuse. Andrew Morris, founder of GreyNoise, wrote on LinkedIn that exploitation remains intense weeks after disclosure.

&quot;React2Shell continues to pop off by our count at GreyNoise Intelligence,&quot; Morris said. &quot;We continue to stack a pretty hefty number of distinct malware payloads. Exploitation is still very high with the number of cumulative networks exploiting this vuln reaching all-time highs almost every single day since disclosure.&quot;

The scale reflects how widely React Server Components have been adopted. Designed to offload rendering work to the server to improve performance, the technology is now embedded in countless production apps, with one estimate suggesting that 39 percent of cloud environments are vulnerable to the React2Shell flaw.

The exact number of known React2Shell victims is not yet known, but Palo Alto Networks has confirmed that more than 50 organizations have so far been compromised. However, the true figure is likely much higher, as researchers warned last week that half of the systems vulnerable to the bug remain unpatched.

For organizations still scrambling to respond, Microsoft urged teams to apply available patches, audit exposed React Server Component deployments, and monitor for signs of exploitation. With exploitation still surging and patching incomplete, React2Shell remains wide open for abuse. ®

Trump’s Truth Social company will fuse with TAE Technologies.

Trump Media, the company that runs social network Truth Social, is pivoting to nuclear fusion. It has announced a merger with California-based fusion power company TAE Technologies, and plans to start construction on a fusion power plant in 2026.

Trump Media & Technology Group will become the holding company of the new organization, though shareholders from each company will own approximately half of the newly formed firm, which the companies say will be valued at more than $6 billion. President Trump previously owned a majority share in Trump Media, but transferred that to a trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., before taking office in January. Don Jr. will be one of the nine board members in the newly formed company.

The new company has ambitious plans, announcing that it intends to begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant” next year, and have it up and running by 2031, though it will have to find a site and secure permits first. That plant is intended to generate 50MWe, though larger 350-500MWe plants are “planned.”

“Trump Media & Technology Group built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we’re taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America’s global energy dominance for generations,” said Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s — an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, revive our manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”

TAE Technologies has been developing its fusion tech for decades, helped in part by investment from Google. The Verge visited TAE back in 2019, when the hope was that a budding new technology called “AI” might help the company crack the code and unlock fusion.

As for Trump Media, it posted a loss of almost $55 million in Q3 2025, but has substantial digital assets after branching out into crypto this May. The merger is expected to close in mid-2026, pending approval by both shareholders and, theoretically, regulators.

            <div id="article-text">﻿AI companies are sick of their favorite buzzword.

﻿AI companies are sick of their favorite buzzword.

The cringe comes for us all, and for all our hot new turns of phrase. “Rizz” lost its luster when grandparents started asking about its meaning. Teachers who dressed up as “6-7” on Halloween drove a nail into the coffin of Gen Alpha’s rallying cry. And tech CEOs who once trumpeted the quest for “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, are jumping ship for any other term they can find.

Until recently, AGI was the ultimate goal of the AI industry. The vaguely defined term was reportedly coined in 1997 by Mark Gubrud, a researcher who defined it as “AI systems that rival or surpass the human brain in complexity and speed.” The term still typically denotes AI that’s equal to or surpasses human intelligence. But now, several of the biggest companies are going for a rebrand — creating their own phrases or acronyms that (spoiler alert) still mean, essentially, the same thing.

CEOs have spent the past year downplaying the importance of “AGI” as a milestone. Dario Amodei, CEO of Amazon-backed Anthropic, has said publicly that he “dislike[s] the term AGI” and that he’s “always thought of it as a marketing term.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August that it’s “not a super useful term.” Jeff Dean, Google’s chief scientist and Gemini lead, has said he “tend[s] to steer away from AGI conversations.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said we’re getting “a little bit ahead of ourselves with all this AGI hype,” and that at the end of the day, “self-claiming some AGI milestone” is “just nonsensical benchmark hacking.” He also said on a recent earnings call that he doesn’t believe that “AGI as defined, at least by us in our contract, is ever going to be achieved anytime soon.”

In its place, they’re pushing a cornucopia of competing terminology. Meta has “personal superintelligence,” Microsoft has “humanist superintelligence,” Amazon has “useful general intelligence,” and Anthropic has “powerful AI.” It’s a sharp about-face for all of these companies, which previously bought into the AGI benchmark — and the fear of missing out that came from not chasing it — in recent years.

Part of the problem with “AGI” is that the more advanced AI gets, the more poorly defined the term seems — since the concept of AI that’s “equal to human intelligence” looks different to virtually everyone. “Lots of people have very different definitions of it, and the difficulty of the problem varies by factors of a trillion,” Dean said.

Yet some companies have billions of dollars riding on this nebulous phrase, a problem that’s clearest in the strange, ever-changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.

In 2019, OpenAI and Microsoft famously signed a contract with an “AGI clause.” It gave Microsoft the right to use OpenAI’s tech until the latter achieved AGI. But the contract apparently didn’t fully define what that meant. When the deal was renewed in October, things got even more complicated. The terms shifted to say that “once AGI is declared by OpenAI, that declaration will now be verified by an independent expert panel” — meaning that now, it won’t just be OpenAI’s call to define what AGI means, it’ll be a group of industry experts — and Microsoft won’t lose all its rights to the tech once that happens, either. The simplest way to put this whole ordeal off? Just don’t say AGI.

Another problem is that AGI has developed some baggage. Tech companies have spent years detailing their own fears about how the technology could destroy everything. Books have been written (think: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies). Hunger strikes have made headlines. For a while, it was still good publicity — saying your tech is so powerful that you’re worried about its influence on the Earth seems to draw big investor dollars. But the public, unsurprisingly, soured on that idea. So, with the complicated definitions, contract drama, and public fear around superpowerful AI, it’s a lot easier to market less-loaded terminology. That’s why every tech company seems to be making some new brand of “intelligence” its own.

One popular general-purpose replacement for AGI is “artificial superintelligence,” or ASI. ASI is AI that surpasses human intelligence in virtually every area — compared to AGI, which is now generally defined as AI that’s equal to human intelligence. But for some in the tech industry, even the idea of “superintelligence” has become amorphous and conflated with AGI. The multiple theoretical milestones don’t even have clearly distinguished timelines. Amodei says he expects “powerful AI” to come “as early as 2026.” Altman says he expects AGI to be developed in the “reasonably close-ish future.”

So companies have developed their own variants. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January that the company needed “to build for [artificial] general intelligence,” but by July, he had pivoted to “personal superintelligence” in a manifesto. It was a power-to-the-people spin on AGI that “helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.” Zuckerberg used the manifesto to combat public fears of AI taking jobs and throw shade at Meta’s competitors, calling the company’s vision “distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output.”

Microsoft, however, has also rebranded its venture as chasing “Humanist Superintelligence (HSI),” which is essentially Zuckerberg’s manifesto in a different font. The company is defining HSI as “incredibly advanced AI capabilities that always work for, in service of, people and humanity more generally” and are “problem-oriented” instead of being “an unbounded and unlimited entity with high degrees of autonomy.” The rebrand came complete with a new website, topped with the term “Approachable Intelligence,” backed with a sepia-style background and a soft color palette, and awash with paintings and photos of nature.

For Amazon’s part, it has rebranded its AGI efforts as chasing “useful general intelligence,” or “AI that makes us smarter and gives us more agency.” Late last year, the company hired the founders of Adept, an agentic AI startup, and licensed its technology, in efforts to compete against others in the AGI race. Like the other companies’ branding efforts, though, Amazon is positioning its UGI efforts as useful, easily defined, and decidedly not all-powerful or scary: just “enabling practical AI that can actually do things for us and make our customers more productive, empowered, and fulfilled.”

With “powerful AI,” Anthropic has no interest in seeming down-to-earth. Amodei dubs it a “‘country of geniuses in a datacenter’” that is “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields — biology, programming, math, engineering, writing, etc.” Powerful AI, he said, would be able to write compelling novels, prove unsolved theorems in mathematics, and write complex code. It would not just answer questions but complete complex, multistep tasks over hours, days, or weeks, similar to AI CEOs’ vision of a successful AI agent, and “absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10x–100x human speed.”

AGI and ASI were already a lot to reckon with. Now we’ve got PSI, HSI, UGI, and PI, too. Cheers to the new acronyms next year will bring.

It will also allow third-party payment processing and web purchases, though with new fees to compensate.

Apple has announced the changes it’s making to the iOS App Store in Japan in order to comply with recent legislation in the country. It will allow third-party app stores and payment processing options, though is introducing new commission fees for those transactions.

Developers in Japan will now be able to distribute apps on alternative app stores, much like in the EU, with AltStore PAL already expecting to launch in the country before the year’s end. As in Europe, Apple will collect a 5 percent commission for in-app purchases made in third-party stores.

App Store apps will also now be permitted to use alternative payment options alongside Apple’s, or link out to websites where users can make purchases. Apple will still charge up to 21 percent per transaction for in-app purchases, with a 15 percent commission for digital goods bought through a website linked from the app.

Apple will include warnings to users when using third-party stores or alternative payment options. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney pointed to those warnings, and Apple’s commission fees, when confirming that Fortnite won’t yet return to iOS in Japan. Similar warnings and fees have been at issue in the US, where Apple recently lost an appeal in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic.

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.

This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.

We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.

That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.

On reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”

Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.

Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.

That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.

But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.

Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

It’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.

This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.

But it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.

In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”

Don’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”

When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.

That’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.

To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Colossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”

In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.

Save the world, and this is the thanks you get?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.

But now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.

In August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.

The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

In August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.

Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.

Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.

In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”

There’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.

Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.

With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

Donald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.

The White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it&#39;s absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)

In 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.

Critics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.

Apple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <div id="article-text">Judging from headlines and social media posts in recent years, one might reasonably assume that AI is going to fix the power grid, cure the world’s diseases, and finish my holiday shopping for me. But maybe there’s just a whole lot of hype floating around out there.

This week, we published a new package called Hype Correction. The collection of stories takes a look at how the world is starting to reckon with the reality of what AI can do, and what’s just fluff.

One of my favorite stories in that package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.

But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? What could that look like?

For researchers hoping to find new ways to power the world (or cure disease or achieve any number of other big, important goals), a new material could change everything.

The problem is, inventing materials is difficult and slow. Just look at plastic—the first totally synthetic plastic was invented in 1907, but it took until roughly the 1950s for companies to produce the wide range we’re familiar with today. (And of course, though it is incredibly useful, plastic also causes no shortage of complications for society.)

In recent decades, materials science has fallen a bit flat—David has been covering this field for nearly 40 years, and as he puts it, there have been just a few major commercial breakthroughs in that time. (Lithium-ion batteries are one.)

Could AI change everything? The prospect is a tantalizing one, and companies are racing to test it out.

Lila Sciences, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is working on using AI models to uncover new materials. The company can not only train an AI model on all the latest scientific literature, but also plug it into an automated lab, so it can learn from experimental data. The goal is to speed up the iterative process of inventing and testing new materials and look at research in ways that humans might miss.

At an MIT Technology Review event earlier this year, I got to listen to David interview Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, one of Lila’s cofounders. As he described what the company is working on, Gómez-Bombarelli acknowledged that AI materials discovery hasn’t yet seen a big breakthrough moment. Yet.

Gómez-Bombarelli described how models Lila has trained are providing insights that are “as deep [as] or deeper than our domain scientists would have.” In the future, AI could “think” in ways that depart from how human scientists approach a problem, he added: “There will be a need to translate scientific reasoning by AI to the way we think about the world.”

It’s exciting to see this sort of optimism in materials research, but there’s still a long and winding road before we can satisfyingly say that AI has transformed the field. One major difficulty is that it’s one thing to take suggestions from a model about new experimental methods or new potential structures. It’s quite another to actually make a material and show that it’s novel and useful.

You might remember that a couple of years ago, Google’s DeepMind announced it had used AI to predict the structures of “millions of new materials” and had made hundreds of them in the lab.

But as David notes in his story, after that announcement, some materials scientists pointed out that some of the supposedly novel materials were basically slightly different versions of known ones. Others couldn’t even physically exist in normal conditions (the simulations were done at ultra-low temperatures, where atoms don’t move around much).

It’s possible that AI could give materials discovery a much-needed jolt and usher in a new age that brings superconductors and batteries and magnets we’ve never seen before. But for now, I’m calling hype.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
