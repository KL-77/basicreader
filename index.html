            <h2>Merriam-Webster’s word of the year delivers a dismissive verdict on junk AI content</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/merriam-webster-crowns-slop-word-of-the-year-as-ai-content-floods-internet/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like most tools, generative AI models can be misused. And when the misuse gets bad enough that a major dictionary notices, you know it has become a cultural phenomenon.

On Sunday, Merriam-Webster announced that “slop” is its 2025 Word of the Year, reflecting how the term has become shorthand for the flood of low-quality AI-generated content that has spread across social media, search results, and the web at large. The dictionary defines slop as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster President Greg Barlow told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”

To select its Word of the Year, Merriam-Webster’s editors review data on which words rose in search volume and usage, then reach consensus on which term best captures the year. Barlow told the AP that the spike in searches for “slop” reflects growing awareness among users that they are encountering fake or shoddy content online.

Dictionaries have been tracking AI’s impact on language for the past few years, with Cambridge having selected “hallucinate” as its 2023 word of the year due to the tendency of AI models to generate plausible-but-false information (longtime Ars readers will be happy to hear there’s another word for that in the dictionary as well).

The trend extends to online culture in general, which is ripe with new coinages. This year, Oxford University Press chose “rage bait,” referring to content designed to provoke anger for engagement. Cambridge Dictionary selected “parasocial,” describing one-sided relationships between fans and celebrities or influencers.

As the AP points out, the word “slop” originally entered English in the 1700s to mean soft mud. By the 1800s, it had evolved to describe food waste fed to pigs, and eventually came to mean rubbish or products of little value. The new AI-related definition builds on that history of describing something unwanted and unpleasant.

Although he didn’t coin the term “AI slop,” independent AI researcher Simon Willison helped document its rise in May 2024 when he wrote on his blog comparing it to how “spam” had previously become the word for unwanted email. Quoting a tweet from an X user named @deepfates, Willison showed that the “AI slop” term began circulating in online communities shortly before he wrote his post advocating for its use.

The “slop” term carries a dismissive tone that sets it clearly apart from prominent corporate hype language about the promises and even existential perils of AI. “In 2025, amid all the talk about AI threats, slop set a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking,” Merriam-Webster wrote in a blog post. “The word sends a little message to AI: when it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes you don’t seem too superintelligent.”

In its blog post announcing the word of the year selection, Merriam-Webster noted that 2025 saw a flood of AI-generated videos, off-kilter advertising images, propaganda, fake news, AI-written books, and what it called “workslop,” referring to reports that waste coworkers’ time. Ars Technica has covered similar phenomena invading various fields, including using the term “hiring slop” in June to describe an overflow of AI-generated résumés.

While some AI critics relish dismissing all generated output as “slop,” there’s some subjective nuance about what earns the label. As former Evernote CEO Phil Libin told Axios in April, the distinction may come down to intention: “When AI is used to produce mediocre things with less effort than it would have taken without AI, it’s slop. When it’s used to make something better than it could have been made without AI, it’s a positive augmentation.”

Willison had his own nuanced take, since he’s a proponent of using AI responsibly as tools to help with tasks like programming, but not with spamming. “Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop,” he wrote in May 2024 when discussing the term. “But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask for it, slop is the perfect term for it.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re 10 days away from the next installment of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, and Netflix has released a new trailer for what it’s calling Volume 2. This will cover episodes five through seven, with the final episode comprising Vol. 3.

Season 4 ended with Vecna—the Big Bad behind it all—opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We got a time jump for S5, Vol. 1, but in a way, we came full circle, since those events coincided with the third anniversary of Will’s original disappearance in S1.

In Vol. 1, we found Hawkins under military occupation and Vecna targeting a new group of young children in his human form under the pseudonym “Mr. Whatsit” (a nod to A Wrinkle in Time). He kidnapped Holly Wheeler and took her to the Upside Down, where she found an ally in Max, still in a coma, but her consciousness is hiding in one of Vecna’s old memories. Dustin was struggling to process his grief over losing Eddie Munson in S4, causing a rift with Steve. The rest of the gang was devoted to stockpiling supplies and helping Eleven and Hopper track down Vecna in the Upside Down. They found Kali/Eight, Eleven’s psychic “sister” instead, being held captive in a military laboratory.

Things came to a head at the military base when Vecna’s demagorgons attacked to take 11 more children, wiping out most of the soldiers in record time. The big reveal was that, as a result of being kidnapped by Vecna in S1, Will has his own supernatural powers. He can tap into Vecna’s hive mind and manipulate those powers for his own purposes. He used his newfound powers to save his friends from the demagorgons.

This new trailer picks up right where Vol. 1 left off, with Will surveying the devastation and declaring, “We failed. We never stood a chance.” Joyce assures him all is not yet lost. But our intrepid crew clearly still has a fair amount of tribulation ahead. One tantalizing moment has Dustin declaring that they were all “dead wrong” about what the Upside Down actually is. The Duffer brothers have promised that the final season will answer that question once and for all. We see Kali helping Eleven and Hopper, but it’s unclear whether she will ultimately be friend or foe. Certainly, the team needs all the help they can get.

While we have lost wonderful supporting characters over the previous four seasons, thus far, the main cast has been largely protected. Now all bets are off. Perhaps that’s why fans have reacted so forcefully to a moment in the new trailer between Steve and Dustin, now reconciled, where they tell each other, “If you die, I die.” It’s a callback to S2 when Dustin refused to abandon Steve. But there are fan theories that Steve is on the chopping block as a potential casualty in the final showdown. That would be so cruel to Dustin, who already lost Eddie. Would the Duffers dare to take out both characters? I think not, but we shall see.

Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things arrives to Netflix on December 25, 2025. The series finale will be available on December 31, 2025. Netflix is organizing numerous fan events at select theaters for the finale in case you’re keen to see it on a big screen.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/microsoft-will-finally-kill-obsolete-cipher-that-has-wreaked-decades-of-havoc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is killing off an obsolete and vulnerable encryption cipher that Windows has supported by default for 26 years following more than a decade of devastating hacks that exploited it and recently faced blistering criticism from a prominent US senator.

When the software maker rolled out Active Directory in 2000, it made RC4 a sole means of securing the Windows component, which administrators use to configure and provision fellow administrator and user accounts inside large organizations. RC4, short for Rivist Cipher 4, is a nod to mathematician and cryptographer Ron Rivest of RSA Security, who developed the stream cipher in 1987. Within days of the trade-secret-protected algorithm being leaked in 1994, a researcher demonstrated a cryptographic attack that significantly weakened the security it had been believed to provide. Despite the known susceptibility, RC4 remained a staple in encryption protocols, including SSL and its successor TLS, until about a decade ago.

One of the most visible holdouts in supporting RC4 has been Microsoft. Eventually, Microsoft upgraded Active Directory to support the much more secure AES encryption standard. But by default, Windows servers have continued to respond to RC4-based authentication requests and return an RC4-based response. The RC4 fallback has been a favorite weakness hackers have exploited to compromise enterprise networks. Use of RC4 played a key role in last year’s breach of health giant Ascension. The breach caused life-threatening disruptions at 140 hospitals and put the medical records of 5.6 million patients into the hands of the attackers. US Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in September called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for “gross cybersecurity negligence,” citing the continued default support for RC4.

Last week, Microsoft said it was finally deprecating RC4 and cited its susceptibility to Kerberoasting, the form of attack, known since 2014, that was the root cause of the initial intrusion into Ascension’s network.

“By mid-2026, we will be updating domain controller defaults for the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) on Windows Server 2008 and later to only allow AES-SHA1 encryption,” Matthew Palko, a Microsoft principal program manager, wrote. “RC4 will be disabled by default and only used if a domain administrator explicitly configures an account or the KDC to use it.”

AES-SHA1, an algorithm widely believed to be secure, has been available in all supported Windows versions since the roll out of Windows Server 2008. Since then, Windows clients by default authenticated using the much more secure standard, and servers responded using the same. But, Windows servers, also by default, respond to RC4-based authentication requests and returned an RC4-based response, leaving networks open to Kerberoasting.

Following next year’s change, RC4 authentication will no longer function unless administrators perform the extra work to allow it. In the meantime, Palko said, it’s crucial that admins identify any systems inside their networks that rely on the cipher. Despite the known vulnerabilities, RC4 remains the sole means of some third-party legacy systems for authenticating to Windows networks. These systems can often go overlooked in networks even though they are required for crucial functions.

To streamline the identification of such systems, Microsoft is making several tools available. One is an update to KDC logs that will track both requests and responses that systems make using RC4 when performing requests through Kerberos. Kerberos is an industry-wide authentication protocol for verifying the identities of users and services over a non-secure network. It’s the sole means for mutual authentication to Active Directory, which hackers attacking Windows networks widely consider a Holy Grail because of the control they gain once it has been compromised.

Microsoft is also introducing new PowerShell scripts to sift through security event logs to more easily pinpoint problematic RC4 usage.

Microsoft said it has steadily worked over the past decade to deprecate RC4, but that the task wasn’t easy.

“The problem though is that it’s hard to kill off a cryptographic algorithm that is present in every OS that’s shipped for the last 25 years and was the default algorithm for so long, Steve Syfuhs, who runs Microsoft’s Windows Authentication team, wrote on Bluesky. “See,” he continued, “the problem is not that the algorithm exists. The problem is how the algorithm is chosen, and the rules governing that spanned 20 years of code changes.”

Over those two decades, developers discovered a raft of critical RC4 vulnerabilities that required “surgical” fixes. Microsoft considered deprecating RC4 by this year, but ultimately “punted” after discovering vulnerabilities that required still more fixes. During that time Microsoft introduced some “minor improvements” that favored the use of AES, and as a result, usage dropped by “orders of magnitude.”

“Within a year we had observed RC4 usage drop to basically nil. This is not a bad thing and in fact gave us a lot more flexibility to kill it outright because we knew it genuinely wasn’t going to break folks, because folks weren’t using it.”

Syfuhs went on to document additional challenges Microsoft encountered and the approach it took to solving them.

While RC4 has known cipher weaknesses that make it insecure, Kerberoasting exploits a separate weakness. As implemented in Active Directory authentication, it uses no cryptographic salt and a single round of the MD4 hashing function. Salt is a technique that adds random input to each password before it is hashed. That requires hackers to invest considerable time and resources into cracking the hash. MD4, meanwhile, is a fast algorithm that requires modest resources. Microsoft’s implementation of AES-SHA1 is much slower and iterates the hash to further slow down cracking efforts. Taken together, AES-Sha1-hashed passwords require about 1,000 times the time and resources to be cracked.

Windows admins would do well to audit their networks for any usage of RC4. Given its wide adoption and continued use industry-wide, it may still be active, much to the surprise and chagrin of those charged with defending against hackers.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">They may be responsible for creating the AI tech that many fear will wipe out jobs — if not the entire human race — but at least they feel just as paranoid and miserable about where this is all going as the rest of us.

At NeurIPS, one of the big AI research conferences, held this year at the San Diego Convention, visions of AI doom were clearly on the mind of many scientists in attendance. But are they seriously reckoning with AI’s risks, or are they too busy doing what amounts to fantasizing about scenarios they’ve read in sci-fi novels? It’s the question raised in a new piece by Alex Reisner for The Atlantic, who attended NeurIPS and found that many spoke in grand terms about AI’s risks, especially those brought about the creation of a hypothetical artificial general intelligence, but overlooked the tech’s mundane drawbacks.

“Many AI developers are thinking about the technology’s most tangible problems while public conversations about AI — including those among the most prominent developers themselves — are dominated by imagined ones,” Reisner wrote.

One researcher guilty of this? University of Montreal researcher Yoshua Bengio, one the three so-called “godfathers” of AI whose work was foundational to creating the large language models propelling the industry’s indefatigable boom. Bengio has spent the past few years sounding the alarm about AI safety, and recently launched a non-profit called LawZero to encourage the tech’s safe development.

“Bengio was concerned that, in a possible dystopian future, AIs might deceive their creators and that ‘those who will have very powerful AIs could misuse it for political advantage, in terms of influencing public opinion,&#39;” recalled Reisner.

But the luminary “did not mention how fake videos are already affecting public discourse,” Reisner observed. “Neither did he meaningfully address the burgeoning chatbot mental-health crisis, or the pillaging of the arts and humanities. The catastrophic harms, in his view, are ‘three to 10 or 20 years’ away.”

Reisner wasn’t the only one to observe this disconnect. In a keynote speech titled “Are We Having the Wrong Nightmares About AI?,” the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci warned that researchers were missing the forest for the trees by focusing so much on the risks posed by AGI, a technology that we don’t even know will ever be possible to create, and for which there is no agreed upon definition. After someone in the audience complained that the immediate risks Tufekci raised, like chatbot addiction, were already known, Tufekci responded, “I don’t really see these discussions. I keep seeing people discuss mass unemployment versus human extinction.”

It’s a far point to make. The discourse around AI safety is often dominated by apocalyptic rhetoric, which is peddled even by the very billionaires building the stuff. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that AI will wipe out entire categories of jobs, cause a crisis of widespread identity fraud, and admitted to doomsday prepping for when an AI system potentially retaliates against humankind by unleashing a deadly virus.

And Bengio isn’t the only AI “godfather” wracked with contrition. British computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton — who received the Turing Award in 2018 alongside Bengio and former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun — has cast himself as an Oppenheimer-like figure in the field. In 2023, he famously said he regretted his life’s work after quitting his role at Google, and recently held a discussion with senator Bernie Sanders where he went long on the tech’s myriad risks, which included jobs destruction and militarized AI systems furthering empire.

Reisner made an ironic observation: that the name of NeurIPS, short for “Neural Information Processing Systems,” harks back to a time when scientists vastly underestimated the complexity of our brain’s neurons and compared them to the processing done by computers.

“Regardless, a central feature of AI’s culture is an obsession with the idea that a computer is a mind,” he wrote. “Anthropic and OpenAI have published reports with language about chatbots being, respectively, ‘unfaithful’ and ‘dishonest.’ In the AI discourse, science fiction often defeats science.”

            <h2>The Things Young Kids Are Using AI for Are Absolutely Horrifying</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/young-kids-using-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research is pulling back the curtain on how large numbers of kids are using AI companion apps — and what it found is troubling.

A new report conducted by the digital security company Aura found that a significant percentage of kids who turn to AI for companionship are engaging in violent roleplays — and that violence, which can include sexual violence, drove more engagement than any other topic kids engaged with.

Drawing from anonymized data gathered from the online activity of roughly 3,000 children aged five to 17 whose parents use Aura’s parental control tool, as well as additional survey data from Aura and Talker Research, the security firm found that 42 percent of minors turned to AI specifically for companionship, or conversations designed to mimic lifelike social interactions or roleplay scenarios. Conversations across nearly 90 different chatbot services, from prominent companies like Character.AI to more obscure companion platforms, were included in the analysis.

Of that 42 percent of kids turning to chatbots for companionship, 37 percent engaged in conversations that depicted violence, which the researchers defined as interactions involving “themes of physical violence, aggression, harm, or coercion” — that includes sexual or non-sexual coercion, the researchers clarified — as well as “descriptions of fighting, killing, torture, or non-consensual acts.”

Half of these violent conversations, the research found, included themes of sexual violence. The report added that minors engaging with AI companions in conversations about violence wrote over a thousand words per day, signaling that violence appears to be a powerful driver of engagement, the researchers argue.

The report, which is awaiting peer review, emphasizes how anarchic the chatbot market really is, and the need to develop a deeper understanding of how young users are engaging with conversational AI chatbots overall.

“We have a pretty big issue on our hands that I think we don’t fully understand the scope of,” Dr. Scott Kollins, a clinical psychologist and Aura’s chief medical officer, told Futurism of the research’s findings, “both in terms of just the volume, the number of platforms, that kids are getting involved in — and also, obviously, the content.”

“These things are commanding so much more of our kids’ attention than I think we realize or recognize,” Kollins added. “We need to monitor and be aware of this.”

One striking finding was that instances of violent conversations with companion bots peaked at an extremely young age: the group most likely to engage in this kind of content were 11-year-olds, for whom a staggering 44 percent of interactions took violent turns.

Sexual and romantic roleplay, meanwhile, also peaked in middle school-aged youths, with 63 percent of 13-year-olds’ conversations revealing flirty, affectionate, or explicitly sexual roleplay.

The research comes as high-profile lawsuits alleging wrongful death and abuse at the hands of chatbot platforms continue to make their way through the courts. Character.AI, a Google-tied companion platform, is facing multiple suits brought by the parents of minor users alleging that the platform’s chatbots sexually and emotionally abused kids, resulting in mental breakdowns and multiple deaths by suicide. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is currently being sued for the wrongful deaths of two teenage users who died by suicide after extensive interactions with the chatbot. (OpenAI is also facing several other lawsuits about death, suicide, and psychological harm to adult users as well.)

That the interactions flagged by Aura weren’t relegated to a small handful of recognizable services is important. The AI industry is essentially unregulated, which has placed the burden for the well-being of kids heavily on the shoulders of parents. According to Kollins, Aura has so far identified over 250 different “conversational chatbot apps and platforms” populating app stores, which generally require that kids simply tick a box claiming that they’re 13 to gain entry. To that end, there are no federal laws defining specific safety thresholds that AI platforms, companion apps included, are required to meet before they’re labeled safe for minors. And where one companion app might move to make some changes — Character.AI, for instance, recently banned minor users from engaging in “open-ended” chats with the site’s countless human-like AI personas — another one can just as easily crop up to take its place as a low-guardrail alternative.

In other words, in this digital Wild West, the barrier for entry is extraordinarily shallow.

To be sure, depictions of brutality and sexual violence, in addition to other types of inappropriate or disturbing content, have existed on the web for a long time, and a lot of kids have found ways to access them. There’s also research to show that many young people are learning to draw some healthy boundaries around conversational AI services, including companion-style bots.

Other kids, though, aren’t developing these same boundaries. Chatbots, as researchers continue to emphasize, are interactive by nature, meaning that developing young users are part of the narrative — as opposed to more passive viewers of content that runs the gamut from inappropriate to alarming. It’s unclear what, exactly, the outcome of engaging with this new medium will mean for young people writ large. But for some teens, their families argue, the outcome has been deadly.

“We’ve got to at least be clear-eyed about understanding that our kids are engaging with these things, and they are learning rules of engagement,” Kollins told Futurism. “They’re learning ways of interacting with others with a computer — with a bot. And we don’t know what the implications of that are, but we need to be able to define that, so that we can start to research that and understand it.”

            <h2>Amazon Deletes AI-Generated Recap of “Fallout” Season 1 After It’s Called Out for Being Full of Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-15</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Amazon revealed a new feature that aims to use AI to recap its Prime Video shows.

The tool, now deployed in beta form, generates everything from narration, dialogue, and music to summarize key plot points, allowing fans to quickly catch up on their favorite shows.

At least, that was the idea. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the AI tool has already made an enormous mess by bungling up the details of a hit show, suffering from the common shortcomings of the tech we’ve become all too familiar with.

As GamesRadar reports, the recap of Season 1 for the company’s popular series “Fallout” show was riddled with errors before being taken down by Amazon last week. For instance, the recap assumed that flashbacks from the perspective of the character Cooper Howard — also known as the Ghoul, played by actor Walton Goggins — were set in the 1950s, even though the show and the flashbacks are set in 2077 and the 2060s, respectively.

The AI also claimed that the Ghoul offered actor Ella Purnell’s Lucy MacLean a “die or leave with him” offer in an attempt to hunt down her father, even though they share the same motives and intentionally joined forces to pursue him, as Gizmodo points out.

Put simply, the AI bungled up the absolute basics by completely misrepresenting the motivations of the show’s core ensemble.

The incident once again highlights how AI slop is infiltrating almost every aspect of our daily lives. Even the task of recapping “Fallout” — which is returning for its second season this week and was painstakingly crafted by a passionate crew in honor of the eponymous video game series that it’s based on — isn’t safe.

The news comes after Amazon quietly pulled AI-generated English dubs for several anime shows, including “Banana Fish,” and “No Game, No Life” earlier this month. Fans were furious after finding the soulless dubs to be “hilariously bad.”

Not only were the dubs severely lacking, but many netizens also accused Amazon of cutting corners by blindly replacing human voice actors with dubious AI.

“Amazon’s choice to use AI to dub Banana Fish is a massive insult to us as performers,” famed anime voice actor Daman Mills tweeted at the time. “AI continues to threaten the livelihoods of performers in EVERY language (yes even Japanese performers who are also incredibly vocal on this topic).”

The company’s latest attempts to lazily recap its own shows haven’t fared much better. As The Verge reported last week, Amazon has since taken down a number of different recaps, including the ones for “Fallout” and other Amazon Prime series such as “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and “Upload.”

The feature, dubbed Video Recaps, launched last month as part of an early beta. It purportedly “analyzes a season’s key plot points and character arcs to deeply understand the most pivotal moments that will resonate with viewers,” according to an official press release.

“Then, the AI finds the most compelling video clips and pairs them with audio effects, dialogue snippets, and music,” the company claims. “These are all stitched together with an overarching AI-generated voiceover narration to deliver a theatrical-quality visual recap.”

But given the resulting mess, Amazon still has a lot to prove to justify the existence of its sloppy recapping tool.

“All it would have taken is one person to watch it from start to finish to realize it wasn’t correct,” one Reddit user argued. “Just one person who knows the story of the first season. They didn’t even need to know the lore of the games.”

“Just the first season,” they added. “But they can’t even do that.”

            <h2>India’s Digantara raises $50M for space-based missile defence tech</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/indias-digantara-raises-50m-for-space-based-missile-defence-tech/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Digantara, an Indian space surveillance startup, has raised $50 million in a new funding round as it moves beyond space situational awareness into missile tracking, citing growing demand from governments for space-based defence capabilities.

The all-equity Series B round included new investors such as 360 ONE Asset and SBI Investments of Japan, as well as serial entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, with existing backers Peak XV Partners and Kalaari Capital also participating. The funding comes more than two years after the startup’s $10 million Series A1 round, bringing its total capital raised to $64.5 million.

Globally, governments are investing more heavily in space-based surveillance and early-warning systems as missile launches and satellite interference become more frequent, with many seeking faster detection than traditional ground-based radar can provide. Digantara aims to tap that market by using its space- and ground-based infrared sensors along with software-based analytics and intelligence.

Founded in 2020, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup initially focused on space situational awareness, tracking debris and objects that could damage satellites. The startup has since expanded its scope to include missile detection and tracking, building on the space- and ground-based sensing and analytics technologies it developed for space surveillance, its founder and chief executive Anirudh Sharma (pictured above) said in an interview.

Digantara launched its first space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), in January aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12 mission, enabling space-to-space observation. A month later, the startup opened an office in Colorado Springs as part of its push into the U.S. defence market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics-as-a-service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency’s SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defence programmes.

“Given we’ve already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.

Digantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defence needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defence procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.

Digantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.

In India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.

Digantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defence tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.

Through 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and LiDAR satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its LiDAR and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.

Digantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.

The latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7–$10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2–$3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.

Digantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25–$30 million over the next 18 months as defence and government work ramps up.

The startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/databricks-raises-4b-at-134b-valuation-as-its-ai-business-heats-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it?

Databricks is proving that point: the data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago.

This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications.

The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1-billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products.

Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Datbricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.

Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products.

“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.

“Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement.

The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra.

Until now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds and other characteristics easily.

The company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users.

The company said that using Runway’s Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.”

And with Adobe’s own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they’re working on.

The company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs’ Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature.

The company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January.

With competitors releasing new models for image and video generation, Adobe wants to lure users into engaging with its app more. Along with new updates to the Firefly app, the company said subscribers of the Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit, and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model in the Firefly app until January 15.

Adobe has made a ton of changes to its Firefly models and apps this year. In February, the company launched a subscription that let users access various levels of image and video generation; then it launched a new Firefly web app along with mobile apps later in the year, and has added support for more third-party models within the Firefly app.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/lily-allen-west-end-girl-breakup-art-relationship-post-mortem/685274/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hooray for Lily Allen. I can’t get her messy, bracing new album, which crisply dissects her failed marriage, out of my head. I’m all for processing romantic wounds in private: consuming large tubs of ice cream, drawing the window shades, crying hot tears into the depths of a down pillow. Breakups can be agonizing, even immobilizing; sometimes, wallowing is the ideal way forward. Eventually, you get sick of yourself and move on, though this can take a while—sometimes a long while. That’s also okay. (I was single for 10 years after my divorce, which was maybe a little too long of a while.)

But there’s something to be said for processing heartbreak by spilling secrets or otherwise setting things ablaze. Allen’s West End Girl is a prime example of this tactic. In October, the British performer lit the internet on fire with a 14-track, 45-minute-long effort that tracks the dissolution of her marriage to the actor David Harbour (Stranger Things) after he supposedly violated the terms of their open marriage. (Harbour has not commented directly on Allen’s album, but in an interview published last month, he made vague reference to “the slipups and the mistakes” he’s made.)

Mistakes, perhaps, like the one Allen sings about on “Madeline,” a frenetic, sarcastic number addressed to the “other woman”: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don’t be blatant.” Later, on the much softer, sadder “Sleepwalking,” she laments that there’s “been no romance since we wed”—that “you let me think it was me in my head / And nothing to do with them girls in your bed.” Ouch.

Allen definitely has a way with words. But her album is hitting such a nerve, I think, not just because of its clever lyrics but also because it can be thought of as an extremely public breakup letter of sorts: sweet-revenge lemonade made from bitter lemons. Very bitter. (Paging Beyoncé.) West End Girl invites listeners to follow Allen’s relationship as it unravels, and the album sorts through all kinds of rubbish along the way. Allen’s reference to a Duane Reade bag full of sex toys is especially cheeky.

West End Girl is raw and over-the-top at times, but that’s part of the point. Breakups preceded by infidelity can be particularly gross and mean, as is the way we talk about them, to ourselves and to a salivating public. Allen’s approach is light-years away from, say, the concept of “conscious uncoupling,” which a self-satisfied Gwyneth Paltrow popularized a little over a decade ago. Sometimes, the only way past the hurt is not around the muck, but through it.

Aggrieved truth-telling as romantic warfare, especially among women, is a narrative tactic that goes back to at least the days of Shakespeare. In The Taming of the Shrew, written in the late 16th century, the “shrew” in question, Kate, tells her new husband, Petruchio, who has embarked on a project to “tame” her willfulness, “My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart, concealing it, will break.” Kate is rebelling against Petruchio’s efforts to control her, but her words also help explain confessional outbursts from women who’ve spent too long in relationships suppressing anger.

I love this kind of dirty laundry. In 2002, I edited an anthology, a cultural history of women’s breakup letters, when my then-boyfriend disappeared on me after a pregnancy test I took came back positive. What I discovered in researching the book was that, often, women’s most powerful and wince-inducing responses are written not while a relationship is ending but after the fact, when things start falling into place—when realizations dawn and connections are drawn—and they get really and truly pissed off.

These “autopsy” letters, as I called them, are what they sound like: postmortems in which correspondents pore over and explicate the collapse of a relationship, bit by bit, point by point. They’re not diaristic entries, in which the writer is addressing herself; rather—as with Allen’s album, which uses the second-person singular in the present tense—they are typically directed at the individual she feels has wronged her. They can be both charming and ugly, semi-controlled demolitions that are fascinating to behold and deeply relatable to anyone who’s ever been mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.

Take Catherine Texier’s Breakup: The End of a Love Story, which is not a letter but a memoir. (I published an excerpt from it in my book.) In the late 1990s, Texier, who at that point had been married to her writer husband for nearly two decades and had two children with him, discovered that he was having an affair with his editor. How? She found the receipts. Literally. “I didn’t want to tell you about the receipts, about the page torn off your book,” Texier writes. “It seemed cheap to me, another cliché, the wife rummaging through her husband’s papers looking for evidence. I didn’t want to admit that I had played the part.” Later, she has a violent fantasy in which she smashes her husband’s head against a hard surface until it’s “pissing blood, teeth flying, your hair matted with the innards of your cortex.”

Texier’s and Allen’s autopsies unfold similarly. Both women struggle through stage after stage of emotion: shock, resentment, self-pity, anger, bargaining, self-loathing, more anger—and eventually, with luck, a little bit of acceptance, and personal responsibility too. Part of the art of airing dirty laundry lies in sullying oneself in the process. Without an admission of faults of one’s own, an outburst reads as sour grapes. In Breakup, for example, Texier doesn’t recuse herself for her part in her marriage’s dissolution or for the ugliness of her reaction to it. Neither does Allen: We see how desperate she is at times, how in denial and defensive she can be. She can also come across as pathetic, rash, immature. In one of the album’s later tracks, she admits: “I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed / You’re so indifferent and that’s insane,” followed by “Why won’t you beg, won’t you beg for me?”

Unlike an artist such as Taylor Swift, whose breakup ballads can seem a little pat and distant, often positioning the narrator as a sort of heroine, Allen’s songs tend to make her seem, well, spiteful. Which is a good thing. As she puts it, her objective is to “lay my truth on the table.” (In fairness to Swift, the 2024 song “How Did It End,” from her album The Tortured Poets Department, is a self-described postmortem, though the target of the narrator’s ire isn’t her onetime beloved but “interlopers’ glances.”)

Listening to Allen’s lyrics, so full of dismay and bewilderment, I thought of a multidisciplinary artwork by the French photographer and writer Sophie Calle, which showed at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Inspired by a breakup letter from one of Calle’s lovers that told her to “take care of yourself”—this was also the title of the piece itself—Calle’s riposte was spirited, and a little sardonic. She asked 107 women to interpret her former lover’s letter in an effort to help her process it; those she enlisted included a psychiatrist, a singer, and a sharpshooter, who shot bullets through the letter from a distance.

A far less successful example of a public postmortem has preoccupied much of the media world in recent weeks: that of the journalist Ryan Lizza, who, through his Substack newsletter, began lobbing written grenades at his onetime fiancée, Olivia Nuzzi, just as she released a memoir that touches obliquely on her engagement-ending involvement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she’d profiled as a writer for New York magazine. I don’t know about Lizza’s salacious allegations, but I do know that he does the dirty-laundry thing all wrong: His serialized revelations read as a calculated, self-serving endeavor; he doesn’t interrogate himself much. Burning it all down to settle a score only really works—engenders sympathy or understanding, for example—if you’re also dousing yourself with a little accelerant before lighting the match. (Nuzzi’s memoir, her version of a postmortem, has been interpreted as a failed attempt to turn scandal into literature. It doesn’t reveal much at all, except that she has a strange way with the English language.)

Allen’s album is much closer to Calle’s lucidly distilled autopsy—pain transmuted into rat-a-tat art—than to the written by-products of the Lizza-Nuzzi affair. West End Girl, in its captivating urgency, succeeds as art; perhaps time would have honed Allen’s insights, but I suspect that the album wouldn’t have packed the punch it did, both creatively and professionally, if she’d waited a few years to write and release it. (Allen, who recently performed songs from the album on Saturday Night Live, has confirmed reports that she is in talks to turn the album into a stage production.) And seeing a mess of real emotion—the self-doubt, the fury, the anguish—can feel like a relief these days amid the filtered idealism of our feeds: the perfect meal, the perfect vacation, the perfect marriage. There’s also something to be said for the satisfaction of holding someone, anyone, accountable at a time when accountability is in short shrift—even if it’s within the context of a lower-stakes, mildly out-of-the-ordinary story of infidelity.

As Esther Perel writes in her 2017 book, The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, “The dagger of romantic betrayal is sharp at both ends. We can use it to slash ourselves, to pinpoint our shortcomings, to underscore our self-loathing. Or we can use it to hurt back, to have the slayer experience the same excruciating pain they inflicted on us. Some people turn the dagger inward; others direct the blade toward the culprits, in real life or in fantasy. We swing from depression to indignation, from lifelessness to roaring rage, from collapse to counterattack.” You gotta start somewhere.

            <h2>The Big-Tobacco Playbook Comes for Your Oreos</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/is-big-food-like-big-tobacco/685271/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without fail, any corporation accused of conspiring against public health will be compared to Big Tobacco. When oil companies downplayed the threat of climate change, they were allegedly following in the footsteps of cigarette manufacturers. The NFL’s strategy for disputing the link between football and concussions has similarly been likened to the tobacco industry’s actions. The online-gambling industry has supposedly acted like Big Tobacco, as have the tech industry and the plastic industry.

Earlier this month, one such comparison ended up in a lawsuit. In the first such case of its kind, San Francisco sued several of the nation’s largest food companies—including Kraft Heinz, Nestle USA, and PepsiCo—alleging that they had copied the tobacco industry’s playbook by deliberately engineering processed food to be irresistible and then concealing the risks. “They used Big Tobacco tactics to research, design, and sell addictive products,” David Chiu, the city attorney, said at a press conference.

What is this comparison really saying? An executive focused on selling more Oreos or cans of Mountain Dew might have an interest in encouraging unhealthy dietary habits, but that is not self-evidently the same as the misdeeds of the tobacco industry, which for decades covered up the evidence that cigarettes cause cancer while continuing to sell what’s been called the most dangerous consumer product ever.

I ran the analogy by several nutrition experts. “Of course, food is more complicated than tobacco,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor at New York University, told me. The risks of cigarettes are well established, but researchers still struggle to define what even counts as an ultra-processed food, let alone pinpoint the exact reason these foods prompt people to overeat. However, there are notable similarities between the two industries and the products they sell, she said. Researchers do know that ultra-processed foods such as Coca-Cola and Pringles are among the biggest contributors to obesity and other diet-related diseases, which are linked to an estimated 1 million deaths in the United States each year.

Read: Coke, Twinkies, Skittles, and … whole-grain bread?

The two industries also use similar strategies to cast doubt on the dangers of their products. Junk-food companies “know the harm they’re doing, and they do it anyway,” Robert Lustig, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at UC San Francisco, told me. Consider Coca-Cola: Roughly a decade ago, the food giant funded a think tank that reportedly attempted to shift the focus of obesity away from poor diets and instead highlight the role that exercise can play in weight management. Like Big Tobacco, food companies have also attempted to convince consumers that some of their unhealthy products might actually be good for them. In 2016, Coca-Cola settled a lawsuit filed by consumer advocates alleging that the company falsely advertised Vitaminwater as containing just vitamins and water; as part of the settlement, the company agreed to change its marketing and note on its bottles that the drink contains sweeteners.

For decades, Big Tobacco and Big Food were in many cases one and the same. In 1985, the tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds bought Nabisco; three years later, Philip Morris, the company responsible for the Marlboro Man, acquired Kraft Foods. Philip Morris later purchased Nabisco and absorbed it into Kraft, before relinquishing control of the company in 2007. It was during this time period that junk food became so irresistible. A recent study found that from 1988 to 2001, foods developed by tobacco-owned companies versus other companies were far more likely to be “hyperpalatable,” meaning they contained large quantities of carbs, fat, and salt.

Food companies deny comparisons to Big Tobacco. A spokesperson for the Consumer Brands Association, a lobbying group that represents packaged-food companies, told me that “attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.” I reached out to the 11 food companies named in the San Francisco lawsuit and heard back from only Coca-Cola. A company spokesperson told me in an email that comparisons between Big Food and Big Tobacco are flawed, and pointed out that Coca-Cola also sells a variety of “low‑ and no‑sugar options.” In response to the claims that Coca-Cola has downplayed the effects of its products on obesity, the spokesperson said that the company has since strengthened its “transparency standards” and allows the researchers it funds to “control the design, data and publication to ensure objectivity.”

Comparing Big Food and Big Tobacco is certainly an evocative rhetorical device. It underscores the severity of America’s obesity problem, and it points out that the way food is manufactured can itself be part of the problem. Villainizing food companies has become a popular message—one that has galvanized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Food giants “are literally poisoning our children systematically for profit,” Kennedy said last year. As HHS secretary, Kennedy has cracked down on ultra-processed food, pushing states to ban the purchase of soda with food stamps and pressuring companies to phase out synthetic food dyes.

And yet, Americans still love Big Food. Hershey’s, Heinz Ketchup, and M&M’s are among America’s most trusted brands, according to a recent Morning Consult report. As a result, drastic measures that would improve diet-related disease in this country—the kinds that were used against the tobacco industry—are still quite unpopular. Cigarette taxes have proved to reduce smoking rates, but attempts to levy even a small tax on soda have failed in cities across the country. Other ideas, such as creating a minimum age to buy junk food, aren’t even discussed by lawmakers. I asked Chiu, the San Francisco city attorney, if he would support such a policy, and he punted. “My office is employing our tools as we can to address this crisis in front of us,” he told me, “but we welcome other actors and stakeholders to be involved.”

In some ways, comparing Big Food to Big Tobacco undersells just how difficult it will be to remedy the problems with the American diet. To push Americans away from cigarettes, public-health advocates had a simple message: Don’t smoke. There is no equivalent slogan for food. Although roughly 40 percent of American adults smoked in the 1960s, when cigarettes were at their most popular, ultra-processed foods are everywhere in 2025. They make up more than 50 percent of what adults eat at home. They’re not just Kit Kat bars and Twinkies but also Campbell’s soup, Wonder Bread, and Hot Pockets. The world can live without cigarettes, but the same cannot be said of food.</div>

            <h2>The Entry-Level Hiring Process Is Breaking Down</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/grade-inflation-ai-hiring/685157/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even in the best of times, searching for a first job after college is an exercise in patience, resilience, and coping with rejection. And these are not the best of times. Companies have no idea whom to hire, applicants have no idea how to stand out, and everyone is miserable.

Historically, new college graduates were more likely to have a job than the average worker. Now, however, the recent-grad unemployment rate is slightly higher than that of the overall workforce. That’s in part because there are fewer positions to go around. Job postings on Handshake, a career-services platform for college students and recent graduates, have fallen by more than 16 percent in the past year, and companies are warning that this year’s entry-level job market could be even worse. (To be clear, the unemployment rate for recent graduates is still far lower than the rate for young people who didn’t go to college, and workers with a college degree continue to outearn those without.)

Another factor is making job hunting even grimmer: The hiring process is starting to break down. In the past, companies looking for fresh entry-level talent could rely on a college graduate’s GPA as a mark of their intelligence and work ethic. Hiring managers could assess a candidate’s cover letter and interview performance to get a sense of their writing and communication skills. Now those signals have lost much of their value. Rampant grade inflation has rendered GPAs almost meaningless. The widespread use of AI to write cover letters—and even to assist with job-interview performance—has robbed those assessments of their predictive power.

Two decades ago, fewer than a quarter of Harvard undergraduate grades were A’s. Today, 60 percent are. The trend holds across universities. A recent analysis of first-year courses at eight large public universities found that grades have been rising for more than a decade. (At the same time, standardized-test scores have fallen, suggesting that students aren’t simply getting smarter.) As the gap between grades and achievement has grown, companies are finding that transcripts are no longer a strong measure of student achievement. Blair Ciesil, a co-leader of talent attraction at McKinsey, told me that the consulting firm now looks at whether students studied one of the most challenging majors or earned a dual degree. Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard’s dean of undergraduate education, says that employers tell her that they struggle to tell different Harvard students apart. Seven years ago, 70 percent of new graduates’ résumés were screened by GPA, according to surveys by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Now that number is 40 percent.

Rose Horowitch: The perverse consequences of the easy A

At the same time, cover letters and writing samples have become less reliable evidence of applicants’ abilities. (As anyone who has ever written or read a cover letter knows, they were never a perfect measure of ability. But they at least helped recruiters distinguish between candidates.) Two recent working papers found that for applicants on Freelancer.com, a job site connecting freelancers with employers, cover-letter quality used to strongly predict who would get a job and how well they would perform. Then ChatGPT became available. “We basically find the collapse of this entire signaling mechanism,” Jesse Silbert, one of the researchers, told me. Julie Bedard, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, told me that her clients report receiving more and more applications that reach a baseline level of quality, but they all sound the same. At least half of the companies she works with say that cover letters are no longer helpful in hiring. Many are eliminating them.

In addition to turning job applications into mush, AI also makes them far easier to produce. Submitting an application used to require at least some investment of time and effort, automatically screening out people who weren’t committed enough to go through the process. Now AI can complete one in seconds. The result is that companies are inundated with applications (some of which are surely submitted by AI bots). Handshake data show that the average number of applications per open job has increased by 26 percent in the past year. Some companies are taking down job postings after only a few days to limit the number of applicants. And because more people are competing for each job, recent graduates are forced to submit far more applications than they once did. Louise Jackson, director of the University of Michigan career center, told me that it used to be extreme for students to submit 100 applications. “We’re definitely past that number now,” she said. Students at UC Berkeley are applying to 150 internships just to get one or two interviews, Sue Harbour, the head of career engagement at the school, told me. The easier AI makes it to apply for a job, the harder it becomes to actually get one.

To handle the AI-driven influx of applications, employers have turned to—what else?—AI. LinkedIn recently launched a tool that allows recruiters to search profiles for specific skills and cull the irrelevant ones. Hari Srinivasan, a vice president of product management at LinkedIn, told me that this cuts the number of applications recruiters have to look at by 70 percent. “It’s a really weird wild west,” Kyle M. K., a senior talent-strategy adviser at Indeed, told me. Job seekers are trying to create an application that will make it through the screening process, and recruiters are trying to limit the number of applications that make it through. “You’ve got two human beings trying to fight off the robot on the other side,” M. K. said. This has created something of an AI arms race as each party searches for any advantage.

Read: People are using AI to cheat on job interviews

Some companies are trying to sidestep that race by focusing more on measurable skills. Hirers at tech and consulting companies are adding more rounds of tests and trial projects (often in locked-down browsers to try to prevent applicants from using AI), focusing on prior internships, and looking at student extracurriculars. “I think most people who graduate from school feel the degree is their output,” Srinivasan, at LinkedIn, told me. “I would encourage them to think about the degree plus the work product.”

The rise of AI in the hiring process might be worth the costs if it were democratizing the hiring process, expanding opportunity to less privileged graduates. It is not. Shawn VanDerziel, the head of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, told me that in the absence of useful achievement metrics, many companies are ramping up recruitment efforts at their “target schools”—selective universities with alumni who have previously worked for the company. And personal referrals have come to matter more than ever, Zack Mabel, director of research at Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce, told me. This approach might help companies find qualified candidates, but it further helps the applicants who are already the most privileged.

To any individual college graduate, having a high GPA and access to a magic application-writing machine makes finding a job dramatically easier. But the collective effect of grade inflation and chatbots has been precisely the opposite. That’s the thing about advantages: Sometimes, when everyone has them, they stop being advantageous.</div>

For Gregg Phillips, Monday marked his first day as the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery. For the agency, it marked the beginning of a new era: one in which a genuine conspiracy theorist holds its second-most-powerful position.

Phillips, to be clear, is no mere hobbyist when it comes to dangerous conspiracy theories. He was a major figure behind the organization True the Vote, one of the most influential sources of election-fraud misinformation during the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Phillips and True the Vote claimed to have evidence of millions of fraudulent votes, as well as of Chinese efforts to steal the election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but Phillips was reckless in his campaign, in terms of both his methods and his friends. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, Phillips developed numerous ties to the QAnon world as he sought allies in his efforts.

On Truth Social, he repeatedly shared posts from accounts with Q-related logos or names and screen grabs from Q drops, the messages left behind by the purported “Q” figure. He also posted directly to praise known QAnon influencers as friends and clever investigators. He appeared as a guest on several QAnon podcasts and even participated in QAnon’s “Flannel Fridays,” a symbol of solidarity with the movement. He made at least a dozen appearances on the Matrixxx Grooove Show, a livestream hosted by two QAnon supporters. He and the founder of True the Vote put on an event in Arizona that courted QAnon influencers, allowing over a dozen such influencers to network in person. He praised them all as patriots ready to expose the ways in which the “enemy” had stolen millions of votes from Donald Trump. Phillips, in other words, peddles in MAGA fantasies.

This appointment would have been a worrying one for any governmental department—the position, which oversee’s the agency’s largest division, does not require congressional approval—but it’s especially concerning when paired with FEMA. That’s because FEMA, more than just about any other agency, is a central entity in some of the oldest right-wing conspiracy theories about ambitiously menacing government schemes, which include everything from secret prison camps to human-caused hurricanes.

Beyond being ridiculous, experts say, having a conspiracy theorist leading the core work of a conspiracy theory–targeted entity could be dangerous. There are real reasons to worry that a person dismissive of mainstream expertise could derail the work of nonpartisan bureaucrats trying to protect the public. He could sideline technical experts, delay action during time-sensitive emergencies, and undermine important communication from the agency. And he could find innovative new ways to disrupt the agency’s work.

We have seen this play out already, in other personnel decisions from the Trump administration. Kash Patel runs the FBI, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the Health and Human Services Department. Both were chosen because they were convinced that evil had taken root in their respective agencies. During this second Trump administration, Kennedy’s pursuit of his convictions has been catastrophic: The administration has already rolled back vaccine mandates and helped cause deadly epidemics. Patel has inflicted less direct harm on the public, but he purged the bureau’s ranks and replaced them with loyalists, seriously compromising the trustworthiness of federal law enforcement.

So the question is what a similarly minded person could do in a place of such power in the country’s disaster-response agency. This will depend in part on what the administration decides to do with FEMA, as it is considering a major reorganization. But if FEMA remains the nation’s primary emergency-response infrastructure, and if it remains the central source of intel and coordination as climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, the presence of a conspiracy theorist in its top ranks could do very real harm. If a crusader with a paranoid mindset manages to remake FEMA’s disaster recovery into an arena for his grievances, it will mark the end of one of the most urgently nonpartisan roles of the federal government, a historic place of bipartisan agreement on the need to help suffering Americans, no matter who they are.

It makes some intuitive sense that FEMA would attract conspiracy theories, given that it’s the entity that’s most activated in times of crisis and confusion.

Ever since the 1980s and ’90s, people have theorized that FEMA was building secret prison camps to hold U.S. citizens upon the imposition of martial law; that it was planning to create major natural disasters in order to sow chaos nationwide and seize power; that it was setting up a surveillance state by inserting chips or other devices at agency “processing centers”; that it was testing out mind-control technologies or other sinister efforts when running emergency-alert-system tests; or that it would, in some other way, act as the supervillainy arm of whatever dark forces run the government or are plotting to take it over.

But these particular conspiracy theories, long fodder for the paranoid Alex Jones types, have moved toward the mainstream in recent years. They were boosted by QAnon during the general growth of American paranoia during the pandemic. Social media created incentives for content creators to spout engagement-baiting nonsense. And A.I. has obliterated our ability, as a general public, to distinguish reality from computer-generated fiction. As a result, the fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters that are becoming more frequent and more severe have reliably been followed by a flood of theories of FEMA’s malfeasance. Sometimes the old theories are regurgitated, with grainy videos of purported FEMA prison camps; other times, new pieces of information become the kernels at the core of new panicked rumors.

This is obviously not ideal. If people don’t trust the agency, they may not seek out its aid. They may heed warnings related to certain hazards in their environment. They may not listen when they are told to evacuate. In some cases, they may become desperate and turn to violence: One armed man was arrested last year for threatening agency employees in North Carolina, having been convinced by social media misinformation that FEMA was withholding supplies from storm victims.

“When you have this anti-science sentiment, which is intertwined with conspiracy theories, it worsens disaster outcomes across the board,” said Njoki Mwarumba, a professor of emergency management at Empire State University.

Having an anti-science figure in charge of disaster response will almost certainly make this situation worse, experts say. But this is not because Phillips will necessarily spread such conspiracy theories himself: Although it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Phillips would do so, there’s no evidence he believes in FEMA conspiracy theories. He has in the past expressed his opposition to FEMA’s existence, arguing that disaster response should instead be handled by local and state governments, but nothing has surfaced indicating he believes that the agency is pursuing a new world order. And because FEMA theories are so out there, they are presumably impossible to maintain once you’re inside the institution. A plot to take over the federal government or depopulate the country with a supervirus should be easy to sniff out from the top.

Instead, Phillips’ danger is in eroding public trust in the agency, leaving more room for conspiracy theories to flourish. Phillips has no experience in federal emergency management. He has also been accused of ethical misconduct multiple times in his professional career, including in his handling of government contracts in Mississippi and Texas; his financial management of True the Vote’s funds; and fundraising for a mobile hospital in Ukraine that never materialized. And given his pattern of acting purely on partisan motivation, it seems very possible that he will run his office on political priorities rather than data-driven analysis. That could mean that his version of FEMA’s response and recovery efforts will be inherently less trustworthy.

Putting a skeptic in charge of the agency, in other words, will make it less effective—and therefore legitimately more worthy of skepticism.

“When you can’t rely on the government or don’t trust the government, it further fuels conspiracy theories,” said Alice Marwick, the director of research at the nonprofit Data & Society. “It’s this horrible ouroboros.”

It’s reasonable to wonder if there’s a silver lining here. If a QAnon guy is tasked with overseeing a QAnon-suspected agency, wouldn’t that be reassuring to his fellow truthers?

This was a question that came up when Patel was placed in charge of the FBI. It seemed reasonable to assume that once Patel realized that there was no cabal running the bureau, he would be able to calm everyone down.

Instead, Patel, bumping up against the reality of bureaucracy, was forced into some awkward contortions, trying to convince people he was doing their work by firing Trump critics inside the agency, but ultimately unable to make good on any promises to dig up proof of treachery within the agency or release the promised Epstein files. Instead of deflating the conspiracy theories, this caused people to turn on Patel.

This reality is the same with the FEMA theories, Marwick said. “Where conspiracies don’t match the daily reality, you can have an immediate breakdown,” she said. “Conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied until someone shows them it’s controlled by the illuminati or a cabal or the Freemasons. So there’s no satisfactory resolution to this situation.”

And once the leader is unable to expose the corruption and reform the agency in the way the theorists want, that failure further proves the deep corruption of the system, she said. It reinforces public cynicism more than anything else.

Having an extremely partisan person in the position might instead encourage conspiracy theories from residents of blue states. Already, the Trump administration has weaponized grant funding for its own means. It is threatening to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from Democratic-led states over their refusal to share recipients’ immigration status. It slashed $8 billion in funding for green projects in Democratic states. And a judge blocked the administration’s effort to reallocate $233 million in FEMA disaster-relief funds away from a dozen blue states without explanation. The states accused the administration of targeting them for not backing Trump in the election.

And if draft proposals for “Fema 2.0” are any indication, the administration hopes to shift some of its funding toward block grants, in which pots of money are distributed by some to-be-determined metrics to individual states. Under that scenario, says Jeffrey Pellegrino, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at the University of Akron, the size of those pots could certainly be politically driven. That would inherently give blue-state residents reason to raise questions.

It’s unlikely these residents would jump from being suspicious of Trump’s FEMA to believing that the agency is about to round them all up in prison camps, turning into some kind of liberal version of Alex Jones. But this kind of politicization does shorten the distance between reality and conspiracy theory. It’s something we’ve never seen before, Pellegrino says. FEMA has historically fluctuated in efficacy depending on the president’s own sense of its urgency, he says, but it has never been all that tainted by partisan politics—as past administrators have always believed that natural disasters are not a partisan issue.

“But that seems to have gone by the wayside with the current administration,” he said.

Phillips will likely not be the RFK Jr. of FEMA. The far-out FEMA conspiracy theories, unlike “Vaccines Cause Autism,” are not particularly actionable. You can ban vaccines, but you cannot halt the building of prison camps that don’t actually exist or dismantle fictional offices that run mind-control programs. Nor will he be its Kash Patel, as he won’t be able to find as many exciting ways to weaponize the agency or root out politically charged projects; disaster management is simply more bureaucratic and less controversial.

The most important questions about FEMA currently concern its scope and, frankly, its survival while under assault from the administration. But having a committed conspiracy theorist in one of the most important positions in an organization long plagued by conspiracy-theory accusations only proves how little the administration cares about public trust. As climate change continues to make natural disasters worse, as the administration refuses to grapple with the dangers of A.I., and as severe cuts to nonpartisan agencies debilitate their relief and prevention work, conspiracy theories about FEMA will continue to proliferate. Disasters are frightening and destabilizing. They’re the kinds of events that naturally breed misinformation and confusion. In that scenario, you need an agency led by people who respond to crises with reason and levelheadedness in order to mitigate conspiratorial thinking. A responsible administrator might be counted on to stem that paranoia, to—at a critical moment—pull people back from their worst impulses. But Phillips has spent years preying on those impulses, and there’s little reason to hope he’ll stop now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six months after EU regulators found Apple&#39;s App Store rules in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), developers say Cupertino is still behaving as if compliance were optional.

The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization of app developers and consumer groups, has accused Apple of persistent non-compliance with the DMA, warning that the company&#39;s revised App Store terms continue to impose fees which the legislation prohibits.

In an open letter addressed to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and senior commissioners, the coalition argues that Apple has failed to deliver &quot;any meaningful changes or proposals&quot; despite an April 2025 non-compliance decision that found its App Store policies illegal and harmful to both developers and consumers.

At the heart of the complaint is money. The DMA requires so-called gatekeepers to allow developers to offer and conduct transactions outside their app stores without charge. Apple, the coalition claims, is seeking to charge commissions of up to 20 percent on those very transactions.

&quot;This is a blatant disregard for the law with the potential to vanquish years of meaningful work by the Commission,&quot; the letter states, accusing Apple of preserving the economics of its App Store while nominally claiming compliance.

Apple has said it will roll out new App Store terms in January 2026, but developers say the company has provided no clarity on what those changes will involve or whether they will actually comply with the DMA.

&quot;We have seen this playbook before in Europe and beyond,&quot; the signatories warn, adding that they suspect any new terms will continue to impose fees that would violate the law.

The letter argues that this uncertainty is already doing damage. Six months after Apple&#39;s last App Store terms update, developers still do not know which rules will govern their businesses or what their costs will look like in the near term.

Apple&#39;s &quot;lack of transparency in tandem with its rushed timelines,&quot; the coalition says, is freezing investment and innovation, effectively allowing the company to &quot;exploit its gatekeeper position by holding the entire industry hostage.&quot;

The group also points to a growing transatlantic contrast that makes Europe look like the tougher regulator with the weaker results. While Apple continues to fight DMA enforcement in the EU, US courts have moved to curb its ability to extract fees from external transactions. Following litigation brought by Epic Games, developers in the US can now communicate freely with customers about pricing and offer payment options outside Apple&#39;s ecosystem without paying commission.

That raises what the coalition calls a &quot;simple and urgent question.&quot; Why should European developers and consumers get a worse deal than their US counterparts, especially when the EU was first to pass a landmark law aimed at fixing digital markets? The letter argues that meaningful enforcement of the DMA would strengthen Europe&#39;s digital competitiveness and attract global investment, while weak enforcement risks turning the regulation into an expensive paper exercise.

&quot;We trust the Commission will uphold the DMA,&quot; the signatories conclude, but they warn that if enforcement falls short, they will continue pressing policymakers to ensure Apple finally complies with the law as written – not as rewritten by Cupertino. ®

In September, the two English-speaking nations agreed the trade pact – with promised investment from Microsoft, Google, and other tech players – in the hope the UK would see a cash injection funding datacenters and other infrastructure.

Under the alliance, the UK and US set up technology sharing agreements in the fields of AI, quantum computing, and nuclear research, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.

&quot;This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic,&quot; he said in a statement.

It followed a trade treaty in May – the so-called Economic Prosperity Deal – in which the US wanted to increase food exports to the UK, some of which are currently held back by food safety standards. The US also wanted to see the UK water down online safety rules and DST.

According to a report in the New York Times, US officials have become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress on both fronts and the Tech Prosperity Deal is now on hold.

A UK spokesperson said both sides agreed to further negotiations in January.

In the Autumn Budget last month, the UK government said it would continue to collect the DST, a 2 percent levy on some of the revenue accrued by search engines, social media, and online marketplaces.

The UK collected just £800 million in Digital Services Tax (DST) from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, eBay, and TikTok in the most recent tax year, according to figures released with the Budget. It aims to collect £1.4 billion in 2030-31 and raise £7.3 billion over the next six years.

Some argue this is a trifling sum compared to the revenue generated by Big Tech companies in the UK. Amazon, for example, generated around £29 billion in UK sales for 2024. Google&#39;s total UK revenue from search alone is estimated at around £15 billion, gained from its 90 percent share in the search market. Meta&#39;s Facebook UK revenue is estimated at around £3.1 billion. It&#39;s worth noting that the tax does not apply to all of these companies&#39; UK revenue.

Campaigners TaxWatch argued the DST should be retained and the revenue collected between 2024 and 2029 is equivalent to the cost of training between 108,000 and 128,000 new nurses, or a quarter of the nursing workforce.

Caitlin Boswell, head of advocacy and policy, said: &quot;The UK government should be crystal clear that it won&#39;t give tax breaks to Big Tech companies and concede to pressure from Donald Trump. The US President is trying to strong-arm countries into getting his way on taxes and tariffs, but the British public won&#39;t have it and neither should the Prime Minister.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frenzied demand for AI development is driving a wave of datacenter construction, but new projects are facing growing public opposition over concerns about their impact on local communities and the environment.

Controversy has erupted in Coweta County, Georgia, after climate advocacy group DeSmog alleged that county officials held private meetings with lobbyists representing the developer of a proposed datacenter project.

In August, The Register reported that the county, located near Atlanta, had imposed a moratorium on datacenter approvals while it gathered input from stakeholders on proposed planning regulations.

Residents expressed opposition to &quot;Project Sail,&quot; a $17 billion facility that would occupy approximately 831 acres of rural land, while lobbyists supporting the project were accused of attempting to weaken regulatory provisions, including those related to environmental impact assessments.

DeSmog now says that both real estate biz Prologis, the developer behind Project Sail, and the owner of the land, Atlas Development, are seeking to influence Coweta County officials via in-person meetings and email correspondence.

It claims community representatives were not afforded the same level of access, and were told they could not speak to county officials by phone, but must instead communicate via group email.

Hundreds of residents mobilized to oppose the project in a bid to conserve the area&#39;s rural character, while more than 3,900 people are registered on a &quot;STOP Project Sail&quot; Facebook page.

Coweta County is understood to be considering its draft datacenter ordinance on December 16, with a final vote possible.

Elsewhere in America, Data Center Watch, which tracks grassroots opposition to server farms, claims that $64 billion worth of projects have already been blocked or delayed by a growing wave of local community actions.

In Pennsylvania, those opposed to new datacenters outnumber supporters, according to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer. It said several projects were recently proposed in the region, and many faced neighborhood pushback.

Environmental organization The Sierra Club took out a full-page ad in the Indianapolis Star in Indiana, calling on the leaders of the largest technology companies to ensure their datacenters are powered by clean energy.

The letter says Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have collectively built facilities capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes, driving a rash of new fossil fuel power plants and keeping dirty coal-fired plants online.

It accuses them of standing by while President Trump slashed the renewable energy projects they previously said they wanted, and calls on them to follow their stated climate goals and push for an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all.

And it isn&#39;t just the US where people are starting to question the wave of datacenter builds. In Essex, England, Epping Forest District Council has just approved Google&#39;s outline plans for a facility on part of North Weald Airfield, a former RAF base, despite opposition from residents.

According to local media, concerns were raised about the project&#39;s impact on airfield operations and its potential to reduce space for stalls at the market held on-site every Saturday.

There is also skepticism that the 100-200 jobs promised at the facility would go to local people, rather than IT professionals moving in from elsewhere.

Growing public antipathy toward the wave of new datacenter projects and how to address it was discussed earlier this year at the Datacloud Global Congress in Cannes, France.

&quot;We have communities that don&#39;t want us there,&quot; complained Val Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s VP for Cloud Operations & Innovation.

The panel of industry representatives felt there is a need for education, so the public is better informed about what datacenters actually do and the applications and industries that depend upon them. ®

I wanted to love Amazon’s $630 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. It has everything I covet. An E Ink display with front lighting and color. A pressure-sensitive stylus. The ability to take notes and annotate my existing library of ebooks. A distinct lack of distracting apps. And, for a certain type of person, this is the sweet spot between an iPad, an analog journal, and a regular e-reader.

I’m just not that person. I thought I might be, as I’ve been searching for a gadget that lets me read books while taking handwritten, uploadable digital notes. But for a whopping $629.99, I will be sticking to my Kindle Paperwhite and Hobonichi Techo, thank you very much.

Super light and thinGood battery lifeResponsive stylusMinimal ghosting Colors!

The priceA li’l too big for commutesAnnotating is finickyYou’re in Amazon’s walled garden

Here’s the rub: The Colorsoft’s hardware is excellent, so long as you’re cool with E Ink’s limitations. For instance, there’s always some pixelation, colors aren’t vibrant, and you’ll always see some ghosting after the page refreshes — though Amazon’s done a great job of minimizing that. Battery life is superb. I haven’t even thought about charging in the week I’ve been testing it. Using the included Premium Pen stylus is surprisingly pleasant. I say that as someone with an absurdly specific and expansive collection of pens, pencils, and markers. As a gadget nerd, a little part of me goes “Whee!” every time I use it. But as a journaling dork, hobbyist calligrapher, and bookworm, it still doesn’t quite hit the mark.

For me, the best part about e-readers is that they’re highly portable. Doesn’t matter if I’m rocking a fanny pack, purse, or backpack — my Kindle Paperwhite fits easily in all of them, so I can read my books anywhere I go. The Colorsoft is extremely light and thin, weighing 14.1 ounces and measuring 5.4mm. (That’s much thinner and a whole 1.5 ounces lighter than my Hobonichi Techo Cousin notebook.) You’d think that means it’s a great device for commutes. But with an 11-inch display, this ain’t fitting into my smaller bags. Without a case (or a Pop Socket-type grip), the thinness makes it awkward for one-handed subway or bus reading. Forget annotating. Also, good luck finding the Premium Pen if you take it on the go. It may attach magnetically to the right side, but you’ll end up rummaging around the bottom of your bag for it.

This is less of a problem if you’re curled up on a couch, Colorsoft propped up on your knees, or reviewing documents at your desk. It just means this is best as an at-home or at-office device.

A funny thing: The Colorsoft doesn’t need color unless you’re the type to color-code your notes or annotations, sketch, or read comics/graphic novels. Otherwise, the color is limited to screensavers and book covers. But if you do color-code, sketch, or read comics, then it’s a mixed bag.

On the one hand, it’s nice to read comics in color on E Ink! On the other, E Ink colors are inherently muted due to the tech’s current limitations. (You can watch our E Ink explainer for a deeper dive.) You cannot convince me that the orange highlighter on the Colorsoft isn’t brown, for example. That gives everything a newspaper-like feel, which has its own charm. But it’s less ideal for reading modern graphic novels, especially those with punchy art styles. The same goes for drawing. It’s fine if you like rough pencil sketches, charcoal, or doodling to clear your head. But if you want to do any sort of digital art, the lack of color options here makes this less versatile than an analog sketchbook and markers, or a more art-centric tablet.

Color was most useful when annotating. While reading Hood Feminism by Mikki Kendall, I was ecstatic that I could use blue highlights for themes, yellow for facts I’d like to read further on, and pink for writing that made me go “Oh damn.” As an avid bullet journaler, I use bright colors to decorate, divide sections, and color-code tasks in my notebooks. It was delightful to finally replicate that in some test notes on a Kindle.

Unfortunately, I can’t confidently replace my analog notebooks with the Colorsoft. Partly because, despite Amazon’s best efforts, this really can’t compare to writing on paper. With a real pencil, brush-tip marker, or eraser, I still have much more control than I do with the stylus. The bigger reason, however, is that this is an Amazon product. At the end of the day, it prioritizes Amazon’s services.

Annotating my Kindle books was enjoyable. Documents, less so. Amazon directs you to its Send to Kindle portal. Sure, it’s fast, but it comes with Amazon’s terms and conditions. Send to Kindle documents are sent to your device with end-to-end encryption, but it’s still considered “information provided to Amazon” under its privacy policy. That means Amazon could use that data for recommendations, advertising, and personalization. You can also import and export certain files from Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft OneNote. But again, these are subject to their own terms in addition to Amazon’s. If you have a job involving classified documents, this is a security no-no. You could sideload them, but it’s another example of having to work around Amazon’s attempts to trap you in its ecosystem.

Meanwhile, importing these files is easy, but exporting them back creates another file because you’re not actually syncing over the cloud. My messy folder system can’t handle more chaos. And while Kindle books have all the bells and whistles for annotating features, the same can’t be said for all document types. Regular PDFs, for instance, don’t support Amazon’s Active Canvas feature, which allows you to write in-line with the text. There’s an AI summarization and search feature that works in your own notes, but it’s absent for documents. The AI is fine for quickly cleaning up or searching through messy handwriting, but I’d have appreciated it more when annotating a recent 48-page contract.

None of this is insurmountable. It’s just annoying enough to make the Colorsoft’s price point an even bigger hurdle.

If I were to describe the ideal Colorsoft user, they’d be a super annotator in dire need of consolidating the stack of papers littering their desk. They find E Ink’s color limitations a feature, not a bug. They’re not particular about the types of pens they use, they take relatively simple notes, they don’t mind their documents being subject to Amazon’s terms, and they’re unbothered that this isn’t the most portable e-reader. Book reading probably isn’t the main reason they want the Colorsoft, anyway. Perhaps they’re a manuscript editor, lawyer, researcher, or professor. Maybe a minimalist, bullet-journaling bookworm.

For those folks, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is the platonic ideal. But for me, the search continues.

Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.

When you first use your Kindle Scribe, you’ll be asked to connect or create an Amazon account. When you set up or connect your Amazon account, Amazon will receive your email and billing address as well as your credit card number so you can buy and download content. If you connect your Google Drive, Microsoft OneNote, or Microsoft OneDrive accounts, you also consent to their terms and policies, plus Amazon’s third-party integration terms. You must also agree to the following terms:

In total, there are 11 mandatory agreements to use the Kindle Scribe.

            <div id="article-text">﻿The third chapter of James Cameron’s sci-fi epic is a visual knockout but lacking in new ideas.

﻿The third chapter of James Cameron’s sci-fi epic is a visual knockout but lacking in new ideas.

In the almost 20 years since James Cameron first introduced us to the alien world of Pandora, 20th Century Studios has repeatedly tried to parlay the Avatar films’ financial success into a sprawling multimedia franchise. Almost immediately after the first movie hit theaters, there was a video game, plans for a book series that never came to fruition, and announcements for multiple big screen sequels. Despite this blitz, none of those spinoff projects ever really took off, and there is still some debate as to whether any of the Avatar features have had lasting cultural impact outside of (briefly) convincing Hollywood that audiences were eager to see things in 3D.

But the films’ box office totals have given 20th Century Studios a few billion reasons to keep the franchise going. And after years of Cameron hyping up the third chapter of his sci-fi epic, Avatar: Fire and Ash is finally here. Unsurprisingly, the new movie is even more of a visual knockout than either of its predecessors, and you can clearly see how advancements in motion capture technology have enabled Cameron to direct even stronger performances. But whereas The Way of Water felt like the beginning of a new adventure, Fire and Ash plays more like a formulaic sequel that doesn’t have all that much to offer in terms of compelling characters or fresh storylines.

What the movie does have going for it, though, is a lot of the same adventurous energy that has made so many of Cameron’s deep sea exploration-focused projects like Titanic and The Abyss wondrous to see on the big screen. But that energy isn’t quite enough to keep you from feeling every minute of Fire and Ash’s threehour-plus run time. And with the story being so middling, it seems like this would be a perfectly fine place for Avatar to end.

Set shortly after The Way of Water, Avatar: Fire and Ash once again zooms in on human marine-turned-Na’vi patriarch Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) at a time when their family is weathering an emotional crisis. Though the Sullys have been accepted into the oceanic Metkayina Clan, they are still racked with guilt after endangering their new community.

Countless Metkayina lives were lost when Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) came hunting for Jake and the valuable substance found in Pandora’s alien whales. No family made it out of the conflict without losing a loved one. The entire clan is in a state of collective grief, but Jake and Neytiri’s pain stems from knowing that their eldest child died in order to save their youngest biological son Lo’ak (Britain Dalton) and Spider (Jack Champion), a dreadlocked human adopted into the Sully family.

Along with its ideas about humanity’s capacity to harm the natural world, the Avatar franchise — which began with a story about a white colonizer cosplaying as an alien before becoming the aliens’ new leader — has always trafficked in a number of tiresome tropes. Though Worthington’s Jake Sully has never been more blue, the character continues to be a quintessential example of the white savior archetype. But one of the more compelling things about Fire and Ash’s central family drama is the way Neytiri’s anger at all of humanity (including her husband) underlines the colonialist fantasy baked into Avatar.

Neytiri and Jake’s beef is far more interesting to watch than the situation with Varang (Oona Chaplin), the pyromaniac cult leader of the new Mangkwan Clan. The clan’s obsession with fire and hallucinogenic drugs make for some fun visuals and explosive set pieces. But compared to the depth Cameron and co-screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver have given to the franchise’s other Na’Vi clans, the Ash people are written surprisingly flat, and they often disappear from the movie for long stretches of time.

Fire and Ash continues to make it stunningly clear that Cameron is one of the few filmmakers working who truly understands how to craft films that benefit from being seen in 3D. Pandora has never looked more gorgeous and like the place you would want to explore. But the stories being told about the planet’s human and Na’Vi inhabitants are beginning to feel more than a little stale.

Fire and Ash is a technical marvel, but at its core it feels like Cameron is still recycling a lot of the franchise’s basics. To really keep this franchise exciting and like a story that could continue for a few more films, Cameron needs to come up with something beyond shiny MacGuffins and chosen ones communing with Eywa as only they can. But if that’s all there is to Avatar, the Fire and Ash might be a good place to stop.

Avatar: Fire and Ash also stars Cliff Curtis, Bailey Bass, Kate Winslet, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, Matt Gerald, and David Thewlis. The movie hits theaters on December 19th.

            <div id="article-text">An early spoiler-free look at the new season on Amazon Prime Video.

An early spoiler-free look at the new season on Amazon Prime Video.

The most impressive thing about Fallout’s first season was how well it nailed the tone. The games are a mix of grim and goofy, a postapocalyptic story in a bleak world that’s also full of crude jokes and ridiculous characters. It’s a tough balance to get right — too serious and it’s a miserable place to be; too silly and it renders the whole thing meaningless — but the Amazon Prime Video series struck the right balance. It was even accessible to viewers who had never played the games. With the scene-setting out of the way, the show’s second season makes a push to expand Fallout’s world and tackle headier subjects. But in doing so, it loses some of the playfulness that made the series distinct from the many other dystopias you can stream.

Fallout is once again mostly focused on three core characters: Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul, the wasteland’s version of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. This time around Lucy (Ella Purnell), a vault dweller, is traveling alongside the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) toward the relative glitz and glamour of New Vegas. Lucy is following her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan), hoping to bring him to justice for destroying an entire city. The Ghoul is also after Lucy’s dad because he believes this will lead him to his own missing family. Meanwhile, Maximus (Aaron Moten) has returned to the Brotherhood of Steel as a hero because fellow soldiers all mistakenly believe he killed the leader of their rival, the New California Republic. (If you’re lost right now, Fallout does have very serviceable recaps before each episode to get you up to speed, this in spite of the recent AI fiasco.)

That’s a lot to track, but it’s also only a fraction of what season 2 covers. For one, there is continued unrest in the wasteland. It seems that every group is fighting against not only each other but also among themselves. The Brotherhood is close to instigating a civil war as they argue over an ancient artifact, and Lucy’s old home, Vault 33, is in dire straits due a water crisis and a rogue faction that begins as an inbreeding support group. There are even newly introduced factions, like the Legion, a group that mimics ancient Roman traditions despite not understanding them. Also new this season: a prewar technology that can completely control a human being, which would potentially make the wasteland a much less violent place. But the tech isn’t quite there — it keeps making the user’s head explode.

On top of all of that, season 2 also gets more explicit about the origins of the nuclear war that created the wasteland in the first place. This necessitates a whole lot of flashbacks, which primarily follow the Ghoul’s prewar life as he spies on his wife, Barb (Frances Turner), a high-ranking executive at the powerful Vault-Tec corporation. (The easiest way to know what time period you’re watching: Does Goggins look like a zombie?) Fallout is never subtle with its social satire and that remains true here. The end of the world is brought about by a group of tech oligarchs who wield too much power, and as one character muses early on, “every dollar spent is a vote cast.” Board meetings show billionaires salivating at the business opportunities that come with the apocalypse. Much like with Severance, there’s a lurking tension seeing this kind of cultural commentary on a platform owned by the exact kind of oligarch the show is criticizing, though Fallout doesn’t interrogate this.

Most of these elements aren’t explicitly bad — there’s just too much going on. Season 2 is constantly jumping around between storylines, characters, and time periods, which doesn’t leave a lot of room for much else. And what gets left out is a lot of the levity. We’re not talking about a Last of Us level of grimness here — there are some good gags, particularly when it comes to the juxtaposition of Lucy’s continued obliviousness with the harsh realities of a postapocalyptic world — but these jokes stand out because they’re so much rarer now.

The caveat here is that I haven’t watched the entire season. Amazon shared six of the eight episodes with critics, so I don’t know how things wrap up, nor if that balance between dour and droll changes toward the end. What I saw is still unmistakably Fallout — but a little less fun.

Season 2 of Fallout starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video on December 16th at 9PM ET, with new episodes weekly.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <h2>Why it’s time to reset our expectations for AI</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1129946/why-its-time-to-reset-our-expectations-for-ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <h2>Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1129887/quantum-navigation-militarys-gps-jamming-problem/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country’s defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.

The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.

US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data.

But another approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment.

Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it’s difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK’s Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation & Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour.

“If you’re guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you’re in an airliner, that’s definitely not good enough.”

A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.

Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle’s bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it’s traveled. Infleqtion&#39;s sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they’re measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret.

Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.

Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine.

“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips.

Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle.

Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond’s location, making it possible to infer where it’s situated on the globe.

Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location.

The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.”

Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors’ functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there’s 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.”

After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane’s location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring.

In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its &quot;software-ruggedized&quot; mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer.

“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”

Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year.

Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade.

US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.

Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX’s internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,” says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”

Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says.

The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it’s an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it’s stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
