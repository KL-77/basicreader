            <h2>Netflix says users can cancel service if HBO Max merger makes it too expensive</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/netflix-claims-subscribers-will-get-more-content-for-less-if-it-buys-hbo-max/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is concern that subscribers might be negatively affected if Netflix acquires Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD’s) streaming and movie studios businesses. One of the biggest fears is that the merger would lead to higher prices due to Netflix having less competition. During a Senate hearing today, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos suggested that the merger would have an opposite effect.

Sarandos was speaking at a hearing held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction.”

Sarandos aimed to convince the subcommittee that Netflix wouldn’t become a monopoly in streaming or in movie and TV production if regulators allowed its acquisition to close. Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a smaller degree, Discovery+).

Speaking at today’s hearing, Sarandos said:

Netflix and Warner Bros. both have streaming services, but they are very complementary. In fact, 80 percent of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. We will give consumers more content for less.

During the hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) asked Sarandos how Netflix can ensure that streaming remains “affordable” after a merger, especially after Netflix issued a price hike in January 2025 despite it adding more subscribers.

Sarandos said the streaming industry is still competitive. The executive claimed that previous Netflix price hikes have come with “a lot more value” for subscribers.

“We are a one-click cancel, so if the consumer says, ‘That’s too much for what I’m getting,’ they can cancel with one click,” Sarandos said.

When pressed further on pricing, the executive argued that the merger doesn’t pose “any concentration risk” and that Netflix is working with the US Department of Justice on potential guardrails against more price hikes.

Sarandos claimed that the merger would “create more value for consumers.” However, his idea of value isn’t just about how much subscribers pay to stream but about content quality. By his calculations, which he provided without further details, Netflix subscribers spend an average of 35 cents per hour of content watched, compared to 90 cents for Paramount+. The Netflix stat is similar to one provided by MoffettNathanson in January 2025, finding that in the prior quarter, on average, Netflix generated 34 cents in subscription fees per hour of content viewed per subscriber. At the time, the research firm said Paramount+ made an average of 76 cents per hour of content viewed per subscriber.

Netflix views WBD as “both a competitor and a supplier,” Sarandos said when subcommittee chair Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) asked why Netflix wants to buy WB’s film studios, per Variety. The streaming executive claimed that Netflix’s “history is about adding more and more” content and choice.

During the hearing, Sarandos argued that streaming is a competitive business and pointed to Google, Apple, and Amazon as “deep-pocketed tech companies trying to run away with the TV business.” He tried to downplay concerns of Netflix becoming a monopoly by emphasizing YouTube’s high TV viewership. Nielsen’s The Gauge tracker shows which platforms Americans use most when using their TVs (as opposed to laptops, tablets, or other devices). In December, it said that YouTube, not including YouTube TV, had more TV viewership (12.7 percent) than any other SVOD service, including second-place Netflix (9 percent. Sarandos claimed that Netflix would have 21 percent of the SVOD market if it merged with HBO Max.

We’re in the midst of what’s expected to be a long series of arguments as Netflix and Paramount Skydance attempt to own WBD’s assets. In the most recent developments, Netflix amended its $72 billion offer to be all-cash. Netflix is looking to buy HBO Max and WB’s film studios for $27.75 per share, or an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. Paramount is seeking a hostile takeover and has sued WBD over its Netflix deal. It has offered $108.4 billion at $30 per share for all of WBD, including its cable channels.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Apple TV released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (kaiju) created by Toho Co., Ltd into a shared narrative. But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: it’s a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it.

As previously reported, the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official Season 2 premise:

Season two will pick up with the fate of Monarch—and the world—hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong’s Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe—all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

In addition to Russell, returning cast members include Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt) as the younger Shaw; Anna Sawai as Cate Randa; Kiersey Clemons as May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa; Joe Tippett as Tim; Elisa Lasowski as Duvall; and Anders Holm playing the younger version of Monarch researcher Bill Randa. Takehiro Hira, Amber Midthunder, Curtiss Cook, Cliff Curtis, Dominique Tipper, and Camilo Jiménez Varón will join the S2 cast as guest stars.

The full trailer opens with our plucky team realizing that whatever kaiju is causing the latest havoc isn’t Kong, or Godzilla, but something even bigger. And it has massive tentacles that the kaiju uses to wrap around a manned boat and drag it down to the ocean depths. Cate blames herself for pressing the button that opened the rift, thereby unleashing this new menace on humankind. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk, so our only hope is to call on Kong and Godzilla, according to Shaw, because “to destroy a monster takes another monster.” But they might just make things worse. At least we get to see a roaring Kong deliver a powerful punch to the new Titan’s face.

The second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres on Apple TV on February 27, 2026. New episodes will be released every Friday through May 1, 2026. And the MonsterVerse is still expanding: Apple TV recently greenlit a spinoff prequel series featuring Wyatt Russell’s younger Shaw, set during the Cold War.

            <h2>Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI deal has seemingly vanished</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/five-months-later-nvidias-100-billion-openai-investment-plan-has-fizzled-out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “Even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with other senior leaders as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for six gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.</div>

            <h2>Newborn dies after mother drinks raw milk during pregnancy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/newborns-death-spurs-raw-milk-warning-in-new-mexico/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newborn baby has died in New Mexico from a Listeria infection that state health officials say was likely contracted from raw (unpasteurized) milk that the baby’s mother drank during pregnancy.

In a news release Tuesday, officials warned people not to consume any raw dairy, highlighting that it can be teeming with a variety of pathogens. Those germs are especially dangerous to pregnant women, as well as young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.

“Raw milk can contain numerous disease-causing germs, including Listeria, which is bacteria that can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or fatal infection in newborns, even if the mother is only mildly ill,” the New Mexico Department of Health said in the press release.

The health department noted that it could not definitively link the baby’s death to the raw milk the mother drank. But raw milk is notorious for transmitting Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. The Food and Drug Administration has a “Food Safety for Moms-to-Be” webpage about Listeria, in which it poses the question and answer: “How could I get listeriosis? You can get listeriosis by eating raw, unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized milk products… .”

Listeria is a particular danger during pregnancy. When exposed, pregnant people are 10 times more likely to develop a Listeria infection than other healthy adults because altered immune responses during pregnancy make it harder to fight off infections. Further, Listeria is one of a few pathogens that are able to cross the placental barrier and infect a developing fetus.

The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists warns patients that if babies survive getting infected during pregnancy, they may be born with “serious infections of the blood or brain.”

“Listeriosis can cause lifelong health problems for your baby, including intellectual disability, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or problems with the brain, kidneys, or heart,” ACOG warns. “Listeriosis can also cause death in newborns.”

While a Listeria infection during pregnancy is one specific risk of raw milk, health officials warn that raw milk can cause serious, potentially life-threatening infections in anyone. Without pasteurization—a process of briefly heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill germs—milk and dairy products can also contain Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Brucella, and Salmonella, among other pathogens.

Still, the unsanitary dairy has grown in popularity among devotees of the wellness industry, including those in the Make America Healthy Again movement. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has personally endorsed drinking raw milk and, prior to taking up the position, claimed he would end the FDA’s “war on public health,” including its “aggressive suppression” of raw milk.</div>

            <h2>X office raided in France's Grok probe; Elon Musk summoned for questioning</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/x-office-raided-in-frances-grok-probe-elon-musk-summoned-for-questioning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French law enforcement authorities today raided X’s Paris office and summoned Elon Musk for questioning as part of an investigation into illegal content. The Paris public prosecutor’s office said the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating Holocaust-denial claims and sexually explicit deepfakes.

Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the “investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.” Europol’s cybercrime center provided “an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.” The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.

French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok’s praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.

The office of Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau said today that the potential crimes being investigated include complicity in possession and distribution of pornographic images of minors; infringement of personal image rights via sexual deepfakes; denial of crimes against humanity; fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system; falsification of the operation of an automated data processing system; and operation of an illegal online platform by an organized group.

We contacted X today and will update this article if it provides any comment. The company criticized the investigation at an earlier stage, alleging in July 2025 that France was conducting “a politically motivated criminal investigation into X” that “threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech.”

X said in July 2025 that it was “in the dark” over what specific allegations it faced related to manipulation of the X algorithm and fraudulent data extraction. X said it would not comply with France’s request for access to its recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.

The Paris prosecutor’s office today said the investigation is taking a “constructive approach” with the goal of ensuring that X complies with French laws “insofar as it operates on national territory.” In addition to Musk and Yaccarino, the prosecutor’s office is seeking interviews with X employees about the allegations and potential compliance measures.

Separately, UK communications regulator Ofcom today provided an update on its investigation into Grok’s generation of sexual deepfakes of real people, including children. Ofcom is “gathering and analyzing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law” and is “progressing the investigation as a matter of urgency,” it said. Ofcom is not currently investigating xAI, the Musk company that develops Grok, but said it “continue[s] to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses.”

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, said today it opened a formal investigation into X regarding the “processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”

“We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children,” the ICO said. “The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”</div>

            <h2>Nintendo Switch is the second-bestselling game console ever, behind only the PS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.

The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”

That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.

As for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).

The huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.

Nintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).</div>

            <h2>Reddit Mod Deleted Breathtaking Photo Taken by NASA Astronaut From Space Because It Was “Blurry”</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veteran NASA astronaut Don Pettit returned from his 220-day mission on board the International Space Station in April 2025, the day of his 70th birthday, making him the oldest active astronaut on the space agency’s roster.

During his seven-month stint on board the aging orbital outpost, his fourth trip to space, Pettit took the time to photograph some dazzling views of the Earth below.

On October 20, 2024, he took a stunning picture of an airplane that was passing by at cruising altitude hundreds of miles below him, a perspective only a handful of people get to enjoy. The plane was likely at around 7.5 miles in altitude, while the ISS orbits the Earth at around 250 miles.

But a moderator at the r/aviation subreddit didn’t look too kindly on the shot after Pettit posted it to the forum over the weekend, deeming it too “blurry” and taking it down as a result. According to a circulating screenshot posted by a user who first brought attention to the takedown, the mod team pointed to the subreddit’s rules to justify its decision, which state that “all blurry or low quality pictures are removed.”

The controversial decision kicked off a heated discussion — and prompted an interjection by a different moderator.

“We brought some new people onto the mod team and unfortunately there are some Learning curves,” the moderator wrote, apologizing for the takedown. “I caught the issue and fixed it. Thanks to everyone who let me know that this happened.”

“I’d say the quality of the picture is pretty dang good considering that it’s from about 250 miles away,” the mod added in a separate apology addressed to Pettit directly.

A quick perusal of Pettit’s submissions to Reddit shows several other fascinating vantage points from the ISS, from atmospheric distortion of the Moon that makes it appear squashed to the Milky Way glinting behind the Earth at night. Another long exposure shows the trails left behind by SpaceX’s Sun-reflecting Starlink satellites.

Other Reddit users were far more impressed than the mod who pulled the post down.

“Can’t believe I got flexed by someone on ISS,” one user wrote.

“Tower, can we get a speed check?” another user joked. (The ISS orbits the Earth at a ground speed of 17,100 mph, while an average passenger jet travels at around 500 to 700 mph, depending on conditions.)

Nonetheless, many users on the subreddit were left with a bad taste in their mouths, with one user describing the unfortunate takedown as “Reddit in a nutshell, baby!” — in an apparent reference to the often-pedantic nature of the people who moderate niche interest subreddits.

“Dear mods, please show NASA how to take better pictures from space so you don’t have to delete them,” the user, who initially raised the issue, wrote.

“What a joke,” another user mocked. One of the most epic pics of aviation from the coolest possible place from an actual astronaut.”

“‘This post breaks our rules,&#39;” they added. “Give me a break, man.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, the United States stock market has been a juggernaut on the international stage. The US dollar has been — and still is — the de facto currency globally.

But for how much longer that will be the case is now looking uncertain. As the New York Times reports, investors are starting to look elsewhere as the Trump administration continues to threaten the independence of its central bank, start a trade war with Europe, and implement self-conflicting monetary policies. As a result of it all, the US dollar continues to weaken, making foreign investments in Europe and Asia far more lucrative.

Meanwhile, Wall Street continues to make enormous bets on artificial intelligence, a highly risky gambit, as tech companies still have plenty to prove and a return still appears to be many years out. The AI boom has sent tech company valuations soaring: the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) now account for just over a third of the entire S&P 500, with experts warning that the industry could be propping up a rough-looking US economy.

The International Monetary Fund warned that the weakening hype surrounding AI could be among the biggest risks to global economic growth, noting that if expectations about AI turn out to be too optimistic, a market correction could send shockwaves across global markets.

President Donald Trump’s nomination for the next chair of the central banking system, Kevin Warsh, appeared to do little to stop the continued weakening of the US dollar, which hit a four-year low last week. The Euro and British pound saw their values soar when measured against the US dollar this year.

Trump —also a huge AI booster, underlining the circular nature of the whole situation — celebrated the weakening dollar, arguing it would make products more affordable, in comments that alarmed investors. Officials had to step in to smooth things over, the NYT reported, arguing that despite Trump’s comments, the US government still supports a strong dollar.

Whether Wall Street’s enormous appetite for AI continues to be a weakening economy’s saving grace, for how long remains to be seen. Investors are sending a clear signal: riskier bets are no longer a hot commodity, as demonstrated by the recent plummet in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Instead, historically safer bets like gold are proving far more lucrative, reaching record highs of $5,500 an ounce in January. Despite a massive drop last week, gold is trading 70 percent higher year over year, indicating investors are seriously on edge.

            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Semiconductor startup Positron has secured $230 million in Series B funding, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The outfit plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

Investors in the round include Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said.

The Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, is reportedly unsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year.

Meanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure – a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron.

The strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructure joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management that was announced in September.

Positron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures and Resilience Reserve.

The company claims its first-generation chip, Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for less than a third of the power. Positron is focused on inference – computing needed to run AI models for real-world applications – rather than training large language models, positioning the company as demand surges for inference hardware as businesses increasingly shift focus from building large models to deploying them at scale.

Sources tell TechCrunch that beyond its memory capabilities, Positron’s chips also perform strongly in high-frequency and video-processing workloads.

TechCrunch has reached out to Positron for more information.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/epstein-linked-longevity-guru-peter-attia-leaves-david-protein-and-his-own-startup-wont-comment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The founder of David Protein, maker of popular high-protein nutrition bars, announced on X on Monday that longevity guru Dr. Peter Attia “has stepped down from his role as Chief Science Officer at David.”

The announcement comes after Attia’s name appeared in more than 1,700 documents, including email correspondence, released on Friday as part of a massive file dump related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to The New York Times. Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also an early investor.

For those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.

Three-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.

In a lengthy post on X, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction.

The fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician. The company declined to comment on Attia’s ongoing participation with the startup or about the pages on its website that used to mention him but now omit his name or return a “file not found” error.

Biograph came out of stealth a year ago, TechCrunch previously reported, with backing from investors that include Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan. Like a growing number of concierge medical service companies, Biograph offers premium preventive health services to subscribers who pay between $7,500 and $15,000 per year. Attia was previously named on the company’s press release and site as a co-founder.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/indias-varaha-bags-20m-to-scale-carbon-removal-from-the-global-south/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Varaha, an India-based climate tech startup, has raised $20 million in fresh funding as it looks to scale carbon removal projects from the Global South and position itself as a lower-cost supplier for verified emissions reductions.

The investment marks the first portion of a planned $45 million Series B round led by WestBridge Capital, the venture firm’s first investment in climate tech, with participation from existing investors including RTP Global and Omnivore. Founded in 2022, Varaha has raised about $33 million in equity to date, alongside $35 million in project financing and $500,000 in grants, as it builds carbon removal projects across Asia and Africa.

India has emerged as an increasingly important base for carbon removal projects, offering lower operating costs, deep agricultural supply chains, and a large pool of technical talent as corporate demand for verified removals rises, including from companies facing growing energy use from data centers and AI workloads. Varaha is positioning itself to capitalize on those advantages, arguing that its execution-focused model allows it to deliver carbon removal at lower cost while meeting the same international verification standards as higher-priced competitors in Europe and North America.

Varaha’s advantage lies less in proprietary technology and more in execution, said co-founder and chief executive Madhur Jain in an interview, arguing that high operating costs could become a constraint for carbon removal developers in wealthier markets as prices come under pressure.

“If carbon credit is a cost to the businesses that are buying these carbon credits … it’s a cost on their balance sheet. It’s not a CSR item,” Jain told TechCrunch. “And hence, if the cost of a certain geography is going to be so high by an order of magnitude of like, 1.5x to 3x credit production, it is going to be extremely hard for those companies to survive.”

Varaha develops carbon removal projects across four main pathways: regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and enhanced rock weathering, working largely with smallholder farmers and industrial partners in emerging markets. The startup generates and sells verified carbon removal credits through international registries, including Puro.earth, Isometric, Verra, Gold Standard, and Switzerland-based Carbon Standards International, positioning itself as a supplier to global corporations seeking durable and independently validated emissions reductions.

To date, Varaha has removed more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide across 14 active projects, generating around 150,000 carbon removal credits, Jain said. He added that the startup was the first in India to issue carbon credits from biochar projects and the first in Asia to issue credits from enhanced rock weathering through an international registry.

Varaha reported revenue of ₹430 million (about $4.76 million) last financial year from delivered credits and expects revenue to rise to nearly ₹1 billion (around $11.06 million) this year, while remaining profitable after tax.

The startup has signed long-term offtake agreements with global buyers including Google and Microsoft, as well as corporates such as Lufthansa, Swiss Re, and Capgemini.

Varaha currently operates across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Ivory Coast, working with about 170,000 to 175,000 farmers over roughly 1.7 million acres, Jain said. The latest funding will be used to expand into additional markets in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Indonesia, while deepening its presence in existing geographies.

The startup is also rolling out an Industrial Partners Program, which allows industrial operators with access to sustainable biomass and gasification capacity to generate verified biochar-based carbon removal credits using Varaha’s measurement, reporting, and verification systems. The program is already operational with partners in West Africa and India, including agribusinesses and a steel producer, as Varaha looks to scale carbon removal through partnerships rather than owning all assets itself.

“The problem is so big that tech, etc., will become open source over a period of time,” Jain said. “So what matters the most is the execution.”

Varaha employs about 225 to 230 people, including roughly 55 across technology, science, product and data roles, with more than 80% of its workforce based in India. While the startup does not maintain offices overseas, it has staff in markets including Nepal, Germany, the U.S., and Australia, reflecting its growing international customer base.

“We believe Varaha is uniquely positioned to build a global carbon-removal platform from India, combining integrity, scale, and impact,” said Sandeep Singhal, co-founder and managing partner, WestBridge Capital. “This investment reflects our conviction in the team and their potential to shape the next phase of climate infrastructure worldwide.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The city’s tech scene is reeling as U.S. immigration agents have escalated their crackdown in Minneapolis, killing several people, including at least two U.S. citizens.

Eight Minneapolis-based founders and investors told TechCrunch that they have put much of their work on hold and now spend their days focused on their communities, volunteering at churches, and helping buy food. It’s part of a grassroots effort, across race and class, that is seeing people speak out, donate money, protest, and offer emotional support to one another.

“There’s a lot of commonality between how a teacher is reacting right now and how a tech professional is reacting,” Scott Burns, an investor in the area, told TechCrunch. He said people are “very fatigued.” Burns is going to church more often to help pack food to deliver to those too frightened to leave their homes. “It was like what happens after a natural disaster,” he said of the effort.

Burns and other members of the Minneapolis tech industry told TechCrunch that the immigration raids have been very disruptive to their lives, describing a city that has seen itself united in the last several weeks in the face of escalating violence from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

How can building a company remain a focal point when ICE agents appear to be everywhere, plainclothed and armed with military-grade weapons? Federal agents have been seen searching public transportation and prowling around workplaces. They are outside homes and in parking lots. They have been spotted circling schools.

One Black founder, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect members of his staff, said he now carries his passport with him everywhere he goes. He is a U.S. citizen but has seen people of color throughout the city profiled and picked up by ICE and border patrol agents.

“People aren’t exaggerating how hard it has been. It’s hard to focus; it’s been a challenge just navigating even my team through it,” he said.

He recalled a routine phone meeting with a colleague who suddenly fell silent. Lost for words, the colleague said she was watching ICE detain someone in the neighborhood, the same one his mother lived in.

“I had to get off the phone and call my mom to make sure she had her passport on her,” the founder said.

Efraín Torres, a Latino founder, works from home, listening tentatively to the immigration raids that happen in his neighborhood. “You can’t not hear them,” he told TechCrunch. Cars will beep. Protestors whistle alerts. “And if you miss it, you’ll see signs saying, ‘My neighbor was taken by ICE.’”

Officials even perform “citizen checks,” stopping people and asking them to prove immigration status — which the Supreme Court said last year can be done based on details like race or if a person has an “accent.” These checks have been conducted on people performing even mundane tasks, Torres said, like snow-blowing the lawn. He said he’s had a few run-ins himself with ICE, which is why he likes to stay low.

“The line separating me from being a victim of assault is just a chance encounter,” he said, adding that he knew people who were followed by ICE — something others have reported is happening alongside raids.

The Trump administration has escalated its immigration raids throughout the country, though the force deployed in the Twin Cities is especially large, with more than 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge.” ICE and border patrol agents now outnumber local police in Minneapolis almost 3 to 1, Senator Amy Klobucharof Minnesota has said.

The state is home to one of the largest populations of immigrants from Somalia, a group the administration has targeted before. That includes U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, who has sparred with President Trump. Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, has also seen himself targeted by the president, as has the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, who is also a Democrat.

The surge in immigration enforcement is part of President Trump’s campaign promise to curb illegal immigration, though some argue that Trump has been specifically targeting cities and states that didn’t vote for him. More than 2,000 people have been arrested by ICE in Minnesota since Trump took office last January.

“It’s been difficult,” said one Black investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He, too, is a U.S. citizen and can trace his roots in the country back for a century. Still, living just outside the city, he carries his passport with him just in case.

“Where I go to the gym, they’re in rural Minnesota,” he said, meaning agents aren’t only in the city. “It’s just been a strange time.”

Everyone is doing what they can, however, to help others. This investor, for example, works with founders in college, many of whom are immigrants. He buys them food so they don’t have to risk going to the grocery store themselves. He also tries to work from home, when possible, as do many of the other people TechCrunch spoke with.

“It’s a tense and difficult time on the ground,” Mary Grove, another investor in the area, told TechCrunch.

Investor Reed Robinson, who has also been helping community members financially, said some of his founders with children have created a volunteer system to watch each other’s kids at school or daycare. It’s so common for ICE to detain the daycare staff, he said, adding that ICE agents frequently violate the law and court orders.

“It feels unnecessary, it feels intrusive, it feels like a violation of rights,” Robinson said about the immigration operation.

Like Robinson, many people feel anger beneath the unease and fear.

The emotional toll makes it hard to build, investors and founders said. Torres, for example, said his company now has a no-ride-sharing-app policy. Some of his engineers are on H-1B visas (which the Trump administration has also attacked) and have reported being followed by immigration officials.

“Each time, it was three to four armed men in tactical outfits,” Torres said, adding that he and his wife have spoken about fleeing the state. “They’re inflicting trauma everywhere they go.”

The Minneapolis tech scene is still quite small, with companies raising just over $1 billion in the past few years. There are some notable companies in the ecosystem, such as the fintech Sezzle (now public), the clean water company Rorra, and the medtech Reema. There is an incredible history of innovation, Robinson said. “It’s not going to stop; we’re going to continue to do the work while we figure out this current situation.”

The Twin Cities — Minneapolis and St. Paul — are the headquarters of some of the biggest American companies, such as Target, Optum, Best Buy, UnitedHealthGroup, and General Mills, to name a few. Some founders and investors criticized the leadership of these big companies, mainly for their vague responses to the chaos gripping the cities, even as many of their own employees are detained.

“We haven’t had an adequate response,” one startup investor said.

Sixty top executives from the state signed a statement that called for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” after ICE agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Large companies in the state have also come together to fund millions in grants through the Minneapolis Foundation for businesses impacted by the immigration operation.

But compared to what is happening on a grassroots level, many founders and investors said these actions are not enough. A recent CNBC poll found that a third of the executives they polled have stayed silent because they didn’t find speaking out relevant to the business. Eighteen percent were worried about “backlash from the Trump administration,” while 9% said they were still figuring out how to respond.

“When you see the failure of community institutions to demonstrate any kind of bravery, that’s really where it’s probably most disappointing,” Tim Herby, a local investor, told TechCrunch, calling the past two months heart-wrenching.

Grove, the investor, said her team routinely checks in with others in the community, including her portfolio companies, to ensure they are doing well. She said people are helping each other pay rent, while restaurants are offering free meals. A local tech nonprofit, Minnestar, is set to host a community event to bring people together and discuss next steps.

One Black investor said he found it ironic that today, the police are alongside many people in speaking out against the government, just a few years after people in the city were protesting against them after the murder of George Floyd. It’s a new day-to-day.

Another Black founder, meanwhile, said some of his white friends have started to drive him around the city for safety. He recalls one day sitting in a restaurant chatting with friends, when the television started giving live updates of ICE shooting another person. The mood fell somber, a reminder of how these raids have consumed every moment of life.

“I saw a friend yesterday,” he said. “It was the first time he left the house since New Year’s.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Intel continues to try to turn itself around, its CEO promised that the company will start producing a new type of chip, one that has been made very popular by rival Nvidia.

At the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.

TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.

The project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.

Intel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.

This initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.

While Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.

It’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.

            <div id="article-text">All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal told The Block.

YC’s famous “standard deal” is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch.

Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC partnered with Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain-related companies.

Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry.

            <h2>Why This Shutdown Is Different</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/ice-government-shutdown-minnesota/685874/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the previous government shutdown, President Trump reveled in the chance to fire federal workers, expand his executive authority, and steer taxpayer dollars toward his allies and away from his perceived political enemies. After a record-setting 43 days of gridlock—during which Trump pursued those goals with varying degrees of success—several Democrats abandoned their quest to force Republicans to negotiate a health-care deal, and voted to end the shutdown. As he signed the bill, flanked by congressional Republicans, who had largely unified around the idea that they would not entertain a policy negotiation while the government was closed, Trump congratulated his party on a “very big victory” over the Democrats.

The second government shutdown of Trump’s second term ended today with much less fanfare and bravado from the commander in chief. This time, Trump negotiated both before and after the government was closed, going so far as to call Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to work out a deal on the main point of contention: his administration’s mass-deportation campaign.

Trump is largely the same person that he was four months ago, when the previous shutdown began. (If you need evidence, in recent days, he has abruptly announced plans to close and completely rebuild the Kennedy Center, suggested that he wants to “nationalize” the midterm elections, and threatened Iran with an attack from “a massive Armada.”) But his push to quickly resolve the latest shutdown highlights how much the political landscape on immigration has shifted following daily, videotaped clashes between masked federal agents and Minneapolis residents, two of whom were killed last month.

“I’m glad we got this done,” Trump said from the Oval Office as he signed the bill and hailed the various programs the legislation would fund. He didn’t address the difficulties that come next: negotiations over accountability measures for federal immigration agents and a lapse in funding for the Department of Homeland Security if a deal can’t be reached within 10 days.

Although Republicans have generally opposed considering policy concessions as a prerequisite for opening the government, Trump and his allies had little choice but to treat this shutdown differently, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, told me. Plunging public support for Trump’s immigration crackdown has reoriented the politics of government shutdowns; the political shift is a culmination of “all the things that we’ve seen on video, everything that America has reacted to in the past few weeks, when we’ve had two American citizens who have been killed,” he said. “Now when you talk about immigration, it is essentially being defined as what’s happening in Minneapolis, and most Republicans know that it’s bad for them.”

On January 24, Alex Pretti became the second American killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Since then, the Trump administration has been looking for ways to contain the political fallout. Trump has dispatched the administration’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, to Minneapolis with explicit orders to calm tensions, had positive phone calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and expressed openness to de-escalating the aggressive tactics used by some federal agents. The president, though, has since begun to retreat from his conciliatory tone, taking to social media to attack Pretti and telling reporters that he is “not at all” pulling back from Minnesota.

But even as he began shifting away from de-escalation, Trump made clear that he was willing to work with Democrats to avoid another government shutdown. The bill that Trump signed today funds most of the government through the end of September and continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security until February 13. Lawmakers and the White House are supposed to use the next 10 days to negotiate broader reforms to DHS’s operations that Democrats say would be necessary before they vote for additional funding for the agency that is carrying out Trump’s mass-deportation effort.

Democrats, who emerged from the previous shutdown without achieving their goal of extending subsidies for health care, say that they are now determined to extract concrete changes in how the nation’s immigration authorities operate. “Immigration and border protection are core responsibilities of our government, but this version of ICE has strayed far beyond that core function,” Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote in a statement today after voting against the funding bill. She said that Congress should demand that DHS shift away from the “chaos and deadly consequences” of its current operations.

Democrats have threatened to withhold their votes on funding DHS beyond next week if their demands are not met. Although the department’s immigration push has been infused with tens of billions of dollars in funds from legislation Congress passed last year, a shutdown of operations could affect other parts of the department’s budget, including TSA and FEMA. Democrats are calling for changes that include requiring ICE agents to stop wearing masks and to obtain judicial warrants in immigration operations. They also want independent investigations of the killings of Pretti and Renee Good. Some are calling for the resignation of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has drawn bipartisan criticism for accusing Pretti and Good of “domestic terrorism” hours after each was killed.

Democrats’ push may already be making an impact. Noem said yesterday that ICE agents working in Minneapolis will begin wearing body cameras immediately and that agents across the country will be doing the same once funding becomes available. But Democrats are likely to face more resistance to their other demands. Asked about judicial warrants today, Trump was noncommittal. “I haven’t even thought about it,” he told reporters. “I’m not thinking about search warrants.”

He deferred to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said that he opposed the call for judicial warrants. Graham pivoted to calling for a ban on sanctuary cities, something Trump said he will be pushing for as negotiations take place in the coming days. Other Republicans have rejected several Democratic requests as unrealistic or unworkable. Senate Majority Leader John Thune predicted that lawmakers would need to pass another extension of DHS funding before February 13, calling the prospect of making significant reforms by next week an “impossibility.”

But, buoyed by the newfound leverage they have to draw Trump to the negotiating table, many Democrats are looking to exert maximum pressure in the coming days. There is disagreement between the Senate and the House, as well as between more moderate and more progressive Democrats, about how hard of a line to draw in the upcoming discussions. House Democrats largely opted not to support the funding agreement negotiated by their Senate counterparts, with some saying that funding DHS at current levels even for a few days would be inappropriate. But Democrats—who have at times opposed government shutdowns due to the potential harm to federal workers and those who rely on the social safety net—are navigating new terrain as they try to rein in Trump.

Recent changes narrowing the kinds of tasks agencies can perform when funding lapses also mean that shutdowns have the potential to hit a larger number of Americans more harshly than before, Abigail André, the executive director of the Impact Project, told me. “The changes some agencies made to shutdown protocols made shutdowns more painful for communities and, therefore, more politically costly,” she said.

Trump has acknowledged that shutdowns can be a political liability. When Democrats claimed big victories in Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, and elsewhere last year on an Election Day that fell during a shutdown, Trump told his fellow Republicans that the government’s closure had played “a big role” in the results. When Trump called Schumer last month to negotiate, the president said: “I hate shutdowns,” the minority leader told The New York Times. Schumer suggested that they cut a deal to rein in ICE. Trump was also hearing from members of his own party, who were reaching out privately to express their dismay over the scenes emerging from Minnesota. Several have spoken out publicly as well, laying the groundwork for negotiations.

When I asked the White House about Trump’s willingness to negotiate this time rather than dig in his heels as government funding lapsed, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not acknowledge the shift, instead blaming Democrats. “President Trump has been consistent—he wants the government open,” she told me. “Democrats should not try to use the American people as leverage to achieve their policy goals.”

But many Democrats say that they are simply following the lead of their constituents, who have shifted sharply against Trump’s immigration policies in recent weeks as masked federal agents have descended on American cities. A Fox News poll released last week found that 59 percent of voters say that ICE has been “too aggressive” in its deportation tactics, a 10-point jump since July.

Andrew O’Neill, the national advocacy director for Indivisible, a progressive organizing group, said in a statement that Republicans are now “on their back foot,” and warned Democrats that voting for any legislation that does not overhaul DHS would constitute a “failure to meet this moment.” Alluding to the street protests that have frustrated ICE’s efforts in Minneapolis and elsewhere, he said: “The public has done its part, and now Congress must do theirs.”

Heye, the Republican strategist, told me that although Trump has an ability to control the news cycle around him, the immigration debate is dominating in an election year that Republicans had promised they would use to address voters’ concerns about the cost of living. Avoiding a prolonged shutdown over unpopular immigration tactics is part of a broader effort to refocus as the midterms approach, he said: “The fact that Americans have been killed means that this will have a longer political memory,” he said. “Republicans should be talking about, Here’s what we’re trying to do to fix costs, and all of this gets in their way.”

            <h2>Trump’s New Threats to American Elections</h2>

With nine months to go until the midterm elections, President Trump’s campaign to subvert them is escalating. His administration has recently taken a series of steps that have election officials, observers, and administrators deeply and rightfully concerned about the prospects for improper interference with the election process.

In October, I published an in-depth article on how the president could interfere (and already was interfering) with the midterm elections. Since then, the reasons for worry have become more urgent. In the past two weeks, the FBI conducted a search in a major Democratic county in a swing state, in service of debunked theories about fraud in the 2020 election; the Justice Department attempted to extort voter rolls from another Democratic state under threat of armed occupation; and the president floated plans to “nationalize” elections. Trump has tried to subvert an election before, but these efforts are earlier, more organized, and—crucially—employing the power of the federal government to help him achieve his personal political goals.

Yesterday, Trump spoke with Dan Bongino, the podcaster turned FBI deputy director turned podcaster, and called for his party to seize control of voting in states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said, reprising an oft-used and incorrect claim. (Voting by noncitizens is rare and does not amount to enough to swing elections.) “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over’—we should take over the voting in at least, many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they’re counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win.”

The federal government has no constitutional or statutory role in states’ election administration, so the call for “nationalization” is an assertion of power that the federal government does not have, a hallmark of other recent White House ploys. Trump’s declaration that “Republicans” could do it may be a suggestion that Congress take action, but it also points to the partisan aims of his attack.

Trump’s efforts to prove that he won in 2020 are all premised on false claims, yet he continues to try to drum up evidence for a conclusion he’s already reached. “You’re gonna see something in Georgia,” he told Bongino, referring to a search this past Wednesday at the Fulton County election center, in Atlanta, where agents looked for records including ballots, tabulator tapes, and voter rolls from the 2020 election. Immediately after that election, Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that he won Georgia, and when his legal efforts to challenge the result fell short, he called the Republican secretary of state and asked him to “find” almost 12,000 votes. (Trump and some associates were charged with racketeering in Fulton County as a result, but the case was dismissed last year.) The search is a stunning intrusion into local election administration. “It’s a five-alarm fire,” as one Arizona Republican election official told my colleagues Sarah Fitzpatrick and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez.

Since the search, more troubling information has emerged. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has no obvious role in the FBI or domestic-election oversight but has been a proponent of bogus fraud claims about the 2020 election, was present for the operation, which she said in a letter to Congress was at Trump’s behest. The New York Times reports that Gabbard met with some of the FBI officers the following day and put Trump on speakerphone for a chat with them—a serious departure from normal practice, and a move that emphasizes the appearance of inappropriate pressure: a federal law-enforcement agency acting as a political agent of the president in a nakedly partisan operation. (Bongino’s own return to partisan podcasting, just weeks after leaving his post as No. 2 at the FBI, demonstrates how politics has infected the bureau.)

As Trump continues to clash with local officials in Minnesota, he also claims that he was cheated out of votes there. “I feel that I won Minnesota—I think I won it all three times,” he said. “I won it all three times, in my opinion.” On January 24, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz demanding that the state turn over its voter rolls to the Justice Department as a condition of the federal government ending its violent crackdown in Minneapolis. Since May 2025, the DOJ has ordered 44 states and the District of Columbia to hand over voter rolls, though it has no statutory right to them. Many states, including Minnesota, have resisted.

Bob Bauer, a veteran Democratic election lawyer, argues that although Bondi’s letter appears to yoke together two unrelated questions—election integrity and immigration enforcement—the Trump administration may not see them as separate, but rather as an opening to interfering with elections using federal agents. “The administration’s lawyers might view the potential deployment of ICE as an option allowing for the fielding of what one advocate describes as ‘essentially an army’ charged with ensuring election security through immigration law enforcement,” he wrote this week.

As bleak as these developments are, a few hopeful signs for the midterms have emerged. First, Trump has been publicly setting expectations for poor results for Republicans, a sign that he may be resigning himself somewhat to a loss. Second, the president’s attempt to force gerrymanders in GOP-controlled states, in order to help preserve the House majority, seems to be ending up as basically a wash, after Democrat-controlled states responded in kind. Third, an election is at greatest danger of interference when the margin of victory is narrow, and Americans’ growing disapproval of the president’s handling of immigration and the economy has buoyed Democrats on the generic ballot for Congress. An old joke goes that the election administrator’s prayer is, “Lord, let this election not be close.” Even as Trump tries to tamper with elections, his actions in office make it more likely that the prayer is answered.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Problem With Using AI in Your Personal Life

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

Take a look. It’s so cold in Florida that iguanas are falling out of trees. Alan Taylor compiled photos of trappers gathering the cold-stunned invasive reptiles by the thousands.

Read. “My extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War,” Eugene Robinson writes. But how did Henry Fordham become a free man?

            <h2>Which Washington Landmark Will Donald Trump Destroy Next?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alas, the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts! We barely knew ye!

The president announced on Truth Social that the recently renamed center will close on July 4 for two full years of renovations. No better way to celebrate 250 years as a nation than by shutting down our center for the performing arts! Most high schools, given the opportunity to shut down their performing-arts departments, don’t view it as an exciting, patriotic celebration, and prefer to have a bake sale. But I am told that this is just how the Founders hoped we would celebrate. (If you remember that John Adams note about how to commemorate the Fourth of July, right after “fireworks,” he suggested “or making it difficult, if not impossible, for people to see Opera, Ballet, Symphonic Performances, Touring Productions of Broadway Musicals, and Sometimes Shen Yun.”)

Everywhere you look in Washington, D.C., buildings are getting their names rejiggered (the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace), their wings clipped (RIP East Wing of the White House), or both. And of course, we must not forget the Triumphal Arch—a possibly 250-foot-tall edifice (One foot for each year! We’d better hope the country doesn’t go on much longer!) that, when complete, will reportedly dwarf the Lincoln Memorial.

Is any building safe? I fear it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable Donald J. Trump AND is slapped on every marquee—but what happens after that? Here are my best guesses.

Donald J. Trump and Washington National Cathedral: Why should George Washington be the only one to have his name on a house of prayer? Trump’s team will also improve all of the windows, which currently are full of lots of little tiny bits of “stained” glass (was new, pristine glass not available?) that make it difficult to see in or out.

Also, instead of a large, depressing wooden carving of some Middle Eastern man in a loincloth being justly punished by the state, we will have something uplifting, like a big golden letter T, maybe a big R, possibly a U, and then a nice MP to round the whole thing off. (This move might result in audiences deserting the building, but then we can demolish it and put in a golf course.)

Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace: The roof of this building will be repainted as a world map, with all of the territories Trump is eyeing for the United States marked for viewers’ convenience. It will be used to house the members of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, who will have been kidnapped by an elite squadron of Trump Peacekeeping Forces and threatened with repeat screenings of Melania until they produce a Nobel Prize for Mr. Trump.

Donald J. Trump Federal Bureau of Investigations: This building will be torn down on the grounds that it is an eyesore from the 1960s, an era when it was believed that a single Watergate-level scandal would be enough to end a presidency, and replaced with either the actual Parthenon from Athens (the ultimate in classical architecture) or the fake Parthenon from Tennessee (Kash Patel and his girlfriend can bring it back on their government jet so that they will be able to mark their latest Nashville excursion as “business travel.”)

The Donald J. Trump and Washington Monument: At first, I thought Trump would simply slap his name on this noteworthy obelisk, but I actually think he will do another Triumphal Arch move and build a much bigger one, all in brass, right next to it. But not too close. Any deaths of birds that fly into it will be offset by the fact that Trump is saving their relatives from windmills.

The Donald J. Trump United States Treasury: Simply putting Donald Trump’s name on the whole Treasury will save everyone the trouble of stashing money in special accounts in Qatar; they should have thought of it earlier.

The Donald J. Trump and Jefferson Memorial: The quotations about how “indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep forever” will be allowed to remain, but a little animatronic statue of Stephen Miller will be installed next to them, shaking his head to show he doesn’t agree.

The Donald J. Trump Pentagon: Donald Trump wants this to be a hexagon for reasons he won’t articulate, and Pete Hegseth lives to oblige!

The Donald J. Trump and Vietnam Veterans Memorial: What is this big, depressing V made from dark stone covered in little tiny names? Suckers and losers, no doubt. Make it a big T instead, all white marble, with the names of donors in gold letters.

The Donald J. Trump Supreme Court: Instead of blind justice standing on the steps (we can do better than some kind of visually impaired woman who is probably dispensing justice to any and all comers without fear or favor), this building will now feature one of those guys covered in gold paint who pretends to be a statue, so he can see who is trying to get justice and let the majority know Trump’s feelings about him so they can vote accordingly.

The Korean War Veterans Memorial: Trump will leave this one alone because he forgot it was there.

The Donald J. Trump and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial: Demolished, obviously.

The Donald J. Trump National Archives: These will first be closed to the public and then scanned carefully for any maps leading to treasure; they will be reopened free to the public only if they contain nothing of value.

The Donald J. Trump U.S. Capitol: This will also be closed for the next two years for “renovations,” except to peaceful and patriotic tour groups. See if Mike Johnson dares to object!

The Donald J. Trump and Smithsonian Institution: After all of the exhibitions have been clawed through to remove all evidence of a very objectionable, political thing called “history,” these buildings will be left temporarily intact until reduced crowds drive a move for renovations. Then Trump will announce that they are being closed on July 4 as a special patriotic tribute (“Those who don’t learn history will … make America great again!”), to be reopened after two years as an imperial palace. Just as the Founders would have wished!

The Donald J. Trump and Lincoln Memorial: Trump will add a large gold statue of himself standing with his hand on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulder to imply that Lincoln is sitting in Trump’s chair and Trump is being patient about it, but his patience might run out soon. Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address will remain visible, but just barely, because the text of Trump’s Second Inaugural Address will be superimposed on it in a very small font to make room for all of the text, completely obscuring any reference to the better angels of our nature.</div>

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Republicans have had a tough stretch. They were defeated in elections in the fall and find themselves at risk of losing control of one or maybe both chambers of Congress later this year. Their standard-bearer, President Trump, has tumbled in the polls and finds himself underwater on his two signature issues, the economy and immigration. There has been unrest in a major American city, and blood shed by Trump’s federal agents. Republicans’ whispers have grown louder in recent weeks: Trump is distracted; he’s focused on the wrong things; the chaos is hurting us. And then a thunderclap from deep-red Texas: a state-Senate race in a district that Trump won by 17 points just over a year ago flipped by more than 30 points over the weekend and elected a Democrat for the first time since 1978.

Now, that is a bad sign for a party in a midterm year. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick deemed it “a wake-up call,” and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a possible presidential hopeful, acknowledged that “a swing of this magnitude is not something that can be dismissed.” And then, hours later, Trump took to social media with an urgent call to action.

“I have determined,” the president wrote, “that the fastest way to bring The Trump Kennedy Center to the highest level of Success, Beauty, and Grandeur” is to close it for about two years before a “Grand Reopening that will rival and surpass anything that has taken place with respect to such a Facility before.”

Trump has never been much for resets. But right now, despite the political peril his party faces, instead of recalibrating he is doubling down. Consider a few of the stories that have dominated the headlines and cable chyrons over the past month: Anger about the scenes of unrest and violence amid ICE deportation operations in Minnesota? Well, the Trump administration has telegraphed that it would like to carry out a crackdown on Haitians in Ohio next. Concern about brandishing military force after the U.S. removed the leader of Venezuela and then threatened Greenland? Trump has sent an “armada” of warships to the Persian Gulf to intimidate Iran. A sense that the president has lost focus on what got him elected as he takes on vanity projects such as the White House ballroom? Well, he’ll see you that and raise you both the Kennedy Center renovation and the construction of a giant arch that no one seems to want.

Trump has always trusted his gut, and his unorthodox political instincts led to one of the most unlikely victories in American politics in 2016 and then, eight years later, its most improbable comeback. He and his White House continue to preach confidence. But will he be proved wrong this time?

For many Republicans, what happened in Fort Worth and its suburbs was the loudest alarm yet. Republican Leigh Wambsganss lost to Democrat Taylor Rehmet despite significantly outspending him. Early analysis has suggested that Republicans have lost some of the gains they had made with Latino voters. Wins like this one are fueling Democratic dreams of stealing congressional seats held by Republicans in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Maine, and, yes, Texas.

Trump tried to distance himself from the Lone Star State result, telling reporters on Sunday, “I’m not involved with that” (he’d endorsed Wambsganss on Truth Social and urged his supporters to vote for her) and “I’m not on the ballot” (maybe not by name, but MAGA infuses all elections these days). Never before has a president so thoroughly dominated the political landscape and national discourse. That is to Trump’s delight, but it potentially works less well for Republicans who are left to defend a series of unpopular decisions and policies, most notably one that was formerly a strength: the president’s immigration agenda.

Many voters liked his plan to fortify the southern border and deport violent criminals who were in the U.S. illegally. But, pushed by the powerful White House aide Stephen Miller to meet huge daily arrest quotas, the administration’s efforts expanded greatly. ICE’s budget was supercharged and officers began to target migrants who, in many cases, had lived in the country peacefully for years, sometimes even decades, and were valued employees, neighbors, and friends. Polls showed that Americans were souring on the effort even before ICE surged 3,000 officers into Minneapolis. What followed: a series of confrontations that left two Americans—Renee Good and Alex Pretti, both 37 years old—dead at the hands of federal agents. The killings, particularly Pretti’s, seemed to play on loop on television and social media for a nation that was largely stuck indoors during a frigid, stormy January.

Read: It wasn’t Democrats who persuaded Trump to change course in Minnesota

An uproar followed, and even some Republicans (quietly) let it be known that changes were needed. Trump appeared as though he might back down. He held cordial calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (both under investigation by his Department of Justice), banished the incendiary Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, and dispatched Tom Homan, his border czar, to the region in the unlikely role of agent of de-escalation. But within days, Trump began climbing down from his climb-down. He once again blasted the Democratic leaders on social media, suggested that he may add more officers, and blamed the state for fostering the atmosphere of violence. And then yesterday, while on a loyalist’s podcast, Trump declared, “Minnesota is a mess. There’s something in the water up there. I won the state three times but I got no credit for it … It’s a rigged state.” (He lost all three elections there.)

Many in the West Wing believe January 3 was a turning point for Trump’s second term, a moment when a presidency that limped to the finish of 2025 was given a jolt of life. That was the day U.S. forces seized the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a Caracas raid carried out with Hollywood-esque precision. Although questions remain about the operation’s aftermath—including the fate of Venezuela’s oil, the role of the United States in running the country, and whether it improved the lives of any Americans—the overwhelming military success astounded Trump. Even now, a month later, he brings it up unprompted to friends and lawmakers, and even during his call with Walz two weeks ago, much to the governor’s confusion.

Trump seems to have a taste for more. He backed down, at least for now, from his threats to invade Greenland after receiving strong pushback from NATO allies and some Republican leaders (including private calls from Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, a person familiar with the conversations told me). But he has become fixated on Iran. Though diplomatic talks are scheduled this week, Trump has not ruled out a military operation against Tehran—and he has grown enamored with the idea of toppling the Iranian regime, thereby achieving something his predecessors could not, an aide and an outside adviser told me. Like others I spoke with, they did so on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the president’s thinking.

Few Trump supporters, however, cast their ballots for international adventurism and gunboat diplomacy. A number of Republicans and MAGA influencers have urged the president to shift his focus back home and on the elections ahead of their party, not the ones behind them. But the president has only ramped up that rhetoric, celebrating the FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, elections office and calling for Republicans to “nationalize the voting.”

In an attempt to keep the president on track, aides have rolled out events on mortgages and housing prices. A senior administration official told me that a prescription-drug announcement is slated for Thursday. White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has urged the president to focus on the economy and last month promised that Trump, who rarely traveled to rally with his supporters last year, would make one trip a week to campaign for Republicans; Trump dutifully held events in Michigan and Iowa. And he didn’t mock the concept of an affordability crisis every time he talked about it.

The White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the president’s approach, telling me in a statement that he “can walk and chew gum at the same time, and that’s especially true of policy priorities such as immigration and crime that also yield meaningful economic benefits.”

But Trump’s goals remain loftier, and centered on making a permanent imprint on the nation’s capital. His original idea for a White House ballroom abruptly escalated to the complete demolition of the East Wing. His construction spree now seems set to include a triumphal arch, as a gateway to Washington from Arlington National Cemetery. The president suggested that it should be 250 feet tall, which would dwarf the nearby Lincoln Memorial and dramatically alter the city’s low-rise skyline.

Then there’s the Kennedy Center. The performing-arts center, on the banks of the Potomac River, is a grand American stage and home to the National Symphony Orchestra. It’s also the official memorial to a slain president, named by an act of Congress in 1964 to honor John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in Dallas just a few months earlier. It was meant to carry the spirit of a young president who, along with his wife, valued the arts and believed they could inspire a nation.

Yet Trump was jealous. He has long wanted to be embraced by the nation’s cultural elite and biggest stars and has been incensed when he was belittled (or ignored) by them, even after achieving the highest office in the land. He took control of the center’s board last year and then, to the outrage of many, added his own name to the memorial. That caused a number of the acts still on the center’s schedule to withdraw, leaving it with little programming (or maybe no programming at all). Trump abruptly announced on Sunday evening that the Kennedy Center would, as of July, close for approximately two years for renovations, even though it had just gone through a $250 million expansion in 2019. Some fear that the revered building will meet the same fate as the East Wing; Trump told reporters yesterday that the center would not be razed, but then again, that’s what he originally said about the future ballroom site.

Before the closure was announced, the center hosted the premiere of the $40 million documentary Melania, about the first lady. Trump donned a black tie for the event. This week, he also has meetings slated with the leaders of Colombia and Honduras. Not on his schedule? A trip out into the nation he leads.</div>

At about two this morning, the familiar howl of air-raid sirens woke me in the center of Kyiv, followed by the low thuds of anti-aircraft cannons attempting to shoot down Russian drones. The news alerts followed, citing the city’s mayor: Russian strikes had left more than 1,000 apartment buildings without power and heat as temperatures fell below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

Vladimir Putin was not going to miss his chance to use winter as a weapon. In recent weeks, Russian missile strikes have hammered the power grid and neighborhood heating systems, leaving both on the verge of collapse. Last week, President Trump appealed to Putin to pause these attacks for a week, long enough for the cold snap to pass and peace talks to move forward. Putin initially appeared to acquiesce—then launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine’s energy network since the start of the war.

No one I met in Kyiv over the past few days expected anything different. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches the four-year mark this month, Putin’s strategy has shifted to one that stands in blatant violation of the international laws of war, which prohibit the bombing of civilian infrastructure. Ukrainians aptly call it “energy terror,” and its goal is to freeze them into a state of hopelessness and soften them up for capitulation.

That goal, like most of his aims in this war, has remained out of Putin’s reach. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to push for peace on terms that his people can accept, including firm guarantees from the United States and its allies that they would act decisively to stop any future Russian attack. Over the weekend, as Ukraine’s negotiators met with Zelensky to plan for U.S.-mediated talks with the Russians this week in Abu Dhabi, hundreds of people gathered for a daytime rave on the frozen surface of the Kyiv reservoir, dancing, skating, and racing their cars.

The images from this defiant party masked a deepening exhaustion in the capital. “People are really on the edge,” Yana Markova, the principal of a primary school in Kyiv, told me when I visited her yesterday. The city’s schools have largely stopped holding classes this winter, and Markova has turned her building into a temporary shelter, its cafeteria serving thousands of meals to people whose apartments have no gas, water, power, or heat. “People have different reactions to all this,” she said over a cup of chicken soup. “Some point their anger at the Russians for doing this. Some blame our authorities for failing to protect us.”

On January 9, after the first massive attack of the year on Kyiv’s energy system, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, urged residents to leave their homes in search of “alternative sources of power and heat.” Temperatures dropped far below freezing that night, and the impact of the bombing “was the most devastating for the capital’s critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement on social media. In many neighborhoods, people sought shelter in subway stations, shivering as they tried to catch a few hours of sleep on yoga mats and camping chairs.

But the metro system does not extend to all parts of the city. The working-class district of Desnianskyi, home to more than a quarter of a million people, consists mostly of high-rise apartment blocks. The blackouts shut down elevators in those buildings, trapping some elderly residents in their freezing homes.

Yesterday evening, about eight hours before the latest wave of strikes on Kyiv, I went to see the head of the district, Maksym Bakhmatov, on the third floor of its administrative building. The ground floor houses the equivalent of a DMV, where people sat around in bulky coats and woolen scarves, some waiting to register their complaints about the lack of basic services. One man used the room’s relative warmth to take a nap.

Bakhmatov sat in his office in three layers of clothes, bracing for the next barrage of Russian strikes. A former television producer, he made his name as a performer on the same comedy circuit as Zelensky, who appointed Bakhmatov to run the Desnianskyi district in May. The official had little hope for the peace talks Trump initiated last year, because the Kremlin has shown no willingness to respect any calls for a cease-fire. “Putin will not stop,” Bakhmatov told me. “His rockets will not run out this year or next year.”

Though his anger was mostly reserved for the Russians, he also had harsh words for the local government, a sign of the political divisions that have deepened as living conditions in Kyiv become more difficult. “The city has sent us zero generators, zero food,” he said. Federal authorities have stepped in to provide emergency assistance, setting up heated tents and food pantries for people in his district.

Read: Ukraine latest attacks showcase its desperation.

After every bomb that hits the nearby power plant, Bakhmatov follows a frantic routine. He gets a call in the middle of the night, warning him of the impending blackouts. The water in every apartment tower in his district—roughly 800 of them—then needs to be drained from the central heating system before it freezes. Failing to do that within two hours could rupture the pipes inside the walls. It might then take years, he says, for the repairs needed to make the buildings livable again. “They have the same heating system in Russia,” Bakhmatov said. “It was all built in the Soviet Union. Putin knows all its weak spots. He knows exactly where to strike.”

The unfolding catastrophe has long been clear to the people who run Ukraine’s energy sector. In the middle of November, one of its top executives, Maxim Timchenko, traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief U.S. officials and members of Congress. “It’s an absolute disaster,” he told me during that visit. “It’s definitely going to be the worst winter of the war, and there is no solution other than an energy cease-fire. That’s the main message I’m bringing here to all levels.”

As the head of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, Timchenko could see that the Russians had carefully selected their targets to maximize the damage not only to Ukraine’s power grid but to its sense of unity. Throughout the fall, their missile strikes destroyed the substations that move electricity from the nuclear-power plants in the western part of Ukraine to the east, where most of the population and heavy industry are concentrated. “They wanted to divide us down the middle,” Timchenko explained. “And in the electricity space, they succeeded.”

Without high-voltage lines to move power across the country, many parts of western Ukraine saw a surplus of electricity this fall and early winter, while the eastern half of the country experienced blackouts lasting as long as 18 hours a day.

As the strikes continued in January and temperatures fell, Zelensky intensified his calls for a partial cease-fire, under which both sides would agree not to target the other’s energy infrastructure. Trump put his weight behind the proposal last week. “I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” he said on January 29. The Ukrainians, Trump added, almost “didn’t believe it, but they were very happy about it.”

The pause in Russian attacks on Kyiv held over the weekend, while other parts of Ukraine suffered more acts of barbarism. On Sunday afternoon, Russian drones attacked a civilian bus owned by DTEK and carrying miners, killing at least 12 people as they rode home from their shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region, in eastern Ukraine. Still, the weekend saw no Russian missile strikes against Kyiv’s power plants, and Zelensky expressed hope that the respite would lay the groundwork for the next round of talks.

They are due to start tomorrow in Abu Dhabi, and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, will be there to mediate. On Saturday, both men met in Florida with the Kremlin’s envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, to discuss the terms of a possible deal. “We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine,” Witkoff wrote afterward on social media. The Russians, he added, are grateful for Trump’s “critical leadership in seeking a durable and lasting peace.”

But that gratitude did not count for much against Putin’s desire to extend the suffering of Ukrainians. He sees the coldest days of winter as instruments of war, and he will use them no matter what mercies Trump may request. As the sun set over Kyiv today, the air-raid sirens started to wail again across the city center. People got dressed and headed to the shelters, determined to wait out the cold for one more night.</div>

They could have built at least a litte moat, I belive, if they&#39;d invested in making good software that works with chatgpt. Integrating chatgpt into your workflow isn&#39;t hard if you&#39;re a coder but very few people who use it are, and coders are the first to learn about the alternative ai&#39;s and start using them - and the mountains of shitty, scammy, insecure, subscription based chatgpt wrappers vibecoded in the last year by random weirdos trying to get rich without doing any work don&#39;t help built user&#39;s confide

A more telling statistic would be the amount of money the AI companies are getting from selling their tat to other companies. The retail consumers do not seem excited and I do not think the AI companies give a flying rat&#39;s ass about retail consumers except as icing on the cake, if it is there. However CEOs seem to be having orgasms over it. Are they putting their money where their mouth has been? Does anyone have anywhere we can go to see these stats?

I wonder if this is why Nvidia has bailed (or looks to be bailling) on their pledge to invest $100 billion in OpenAI?It probably wouldn&#39;t be a good bet pouring all that money into a company whose market share is tending down that fast.

You mean, to continue to have taxpayers subsidize Walmart and McDonalds business operations. What Walmart and McDonalds save in payroll, taxpayers provide. Just like you &quot;pay the cops salary&quot;, you&#39;re paying those Walmart and mCdonalds employees as well.

I&#39;m sure that all the Amazon delivery contractors making $5 an hour over minimum wage feel the same way about their multi-billionaire corporate overlords. That&#39;s not just pee going into those empty water bottles under the driver&#39;s seat... it&#39;s pride!

What about retirees whose investments are dependent on Walmart being efficient?

Won&#39;t someone think of the shareholders? How will the Waltons ever get enough to eat?

Concentrating wealth reduces overall wealth. Your hypothetical retiree would benefit more from a healthy US economy than from a slight gain in a single stock.

It&#39;s not just Walmart you apply these &quot;omg they&#39;re making money&quot; arguments to is it? 162 million Americans (62%) own shares, so I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s &quot;concentrating wealth&quot;.

Inflation is a flat tax on people who hoard money under their mattresses and in their bank accounts.And I&#39;m totally sure you posting this same argument during the inflation in Biden&#39;s term.

Not much else needs to be said. A $1T company, yet a drain on the nation.

Inflation is the drain on the nation.  The reason for all of these 1 Trillion dollar companies is that there are all of these money created by the various governments and banks propped up by government entities, all of the bail outs, money printing, quantitative easing (money printing), etc., all of it is inflation, i.e. expansion of the money supply.  Much of it is driven by the pathetically low interest rates, manipulated by the government over the last few decades (as the governments got off the gold), a

IMHO, I&#39;m curious who is shopping from there.  I know that I rather go anywhere else than WM, because stuff like underwear, headlight bulbs, even batteries are locked up, and good luck getting a store person to even bother walking over to help with that.  Even when they do, it means the end of your shopping visit, as you have to follow them to the register.  Mail order?  Amazon.

I can see them getting a captive audience if they are the only grocery store in a town, but in cities with an ALDI, HEB (a Texas chain that doesn&#39;t suck), or other stores, people tend to go there.

I miss the days when they had some reason to stick around, be it a McDonald&#39;s their own store, or even a Subway.  Now, without the secondary stores, it just sucks, and even Targets have a Pizza Hut and a mini Starbucks that I can get a drink at.

Wish things would change so that we had real department stores again.  IMO, WM shopping is pure drudgery now.

IMHO, I&#39;m curious who is shopping from there.walmart.com has become somewhat of an alternative to amazon.com.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A switch on the wall that you can use to turn lights on and off. We live in truly magical times.

All jokes aside, this is more useful as &quot;a button next to my bed that shuts off all the inside and outside lights, closes all the doors, activates the alarm, turns down the heat, makes sure the tv is off, and disables notifications until the morning.&quot;

I&#39;ve also seen one used as &quot;a button to hit on your way to work to shut off all the things you forgot to shut off.&quot;

A panic button next to your bed could be &quot;turn on all the outside lights, save all the security camera footage somewhere extra, and tell me if any motion detectors outside this room go off any time in the next 10 minutes.&quot;

I imagine someone will want one that makes their cell phone make a noise, so they can find it.

Or, it&#39;s a simple way to add a second switch to a room (or hallway) with one inconveniently-placed switch.

For a young child who is afraid of the dark, a button to dim the lights to 20% after they&#39;re in bed, and automatically turn them off an hour later.

This. The person who focuses on the lights in the room is completely missing the point and should not invest in or even talk about smart home. The smart home is a replacement for any project that would require you to run more than 3 wires to a fitting.

I&#39;ve never used google home, so I&#39;m totally in the dark here--but if they haven&#39;t previously implemented a feature as simple as a button or switch, how can it do anything else at all? It&#39;s the most basic of input methods.At any rate, occupancy sensors / motion sensors basically operate on the same premise as a physical switch in any home automation system I&#39;ve ever used. Without that capability can it even be called a smart home system?

You are correct. have always had turn on and turn off, but that was just the switch in a device. If I understand the summary...F the VergePayWall. This allows you to add a switch with user defineable actions, that can include multiple actions or devices.A single local button to turn on my PC/Printer/Speakers versus voice or app.

Indeed. Labor to install switches in new locations can be very expensive, especially if you need long runs and also have to open, patch, repaint and texture drywall. It can easily add up to 30x the cost of a wireless battery operated smart button, usually referred to a scene controller.

However, it should still work without the cloud needing to be up. I had a 24 hour Comcast outage recently. No reason my smart lights and switches should stop working during the outage. And they did not, since I use Home assis

Great! So there&#39;s a non-zero chance Portuguese speakers get &#39;Continued Conversation&#39; before 2030?Just kidding... Everyone knows Google Brazil is just a law firm with a cafeteria. :/

Google &quot;Google home&quot;.It&#39;s not Google Launcher.

> meaning one button can do multiple things.

At last, we know how the console buttons of Padme&#39;s ship work.

Google then announced that they&#39;d be shuttering all Google Home products and services on July 1st, 2026 because an in-house review found that Google Home was popular and useful.

.. Google Home has been nerfed in so many ways over the past few years, it&#39;s almost useless now save for turning my lights on and off.

- They killed the Apps SDK, and all games and custom stuff- They killed Google Music, and &#39;play X from my Library&quot;, only Youtube Premium Music now or ads in between every damn track- They killed all podcast feeds other than Youtube Music (many podcasts aren&#39;t on Youtube).- They have borked most radio stations (used to be able to play almost any station via TuneIn)

The Enshittification has been wide, deep and purposeful. No way in hell will I *ever* pay for Youtube Premium.

Home Assistant is the way to go. IKEA smart stuff is decent too, because it works well with Home Assistant and they seem to have taken the position that they will make it easy to replace the &quot;brains&quot; of the system with your own.

The video doorbells (which are part of Google Home) have been using the same software for a decade now. They are clearly not investing in upgrades to the usability of the app and web interface. It often takes a minute or two to get a live video feed when somebody rings the doorbell, and that&#39;s despite having Wifi 6 and 5G fiber. And half the time, instead of the video feed, you get a nag message trying to offer some upgrade or other service, and then it won&#39;t show you the actual notification that triggered

Seriously, when you consider this type of product, you LOOK at it. And a home automation solution that does not support buttons? That is just a bad joke to stay away from.

&quot;Google refused to explain why all supported buttons were required to contain microphones.&quot;

To add to your point, it&#39;s worth remembering that ultra processed foods are still inherently foods underneath. So why is it that a bag of chicken nuggets is cheaper than buying a whole chicken of the same weight. The answer is in the economic system setup to incentivize this production of UPF. If you can direct that at incentivizing healthy food instead the poor people may actually be healthier than the wealthy.

I can see you are extremely emotional about this issue.

I doubt the opposition to feeding children is based on some &quot;out group&quot; bias, but more in the practicalities. The argument is two fold; quality and cost.  Free food for children will prompt more parents to simply rely on the government to feed their children, resulting in worse health outcomes for the children.  That&#39;s the quality argument, and it&#39;s not a bad one truth be told.

Cost is, of course, as I mentioned; I have yet to meet a government program w

Most humans are emotional about feeding children. Some are emotional about making sure they eat while others are emotional about not paying a few dollars in taxes per year so that they can do so.

Remember when &quot;it&#39;s for the children&quot; was rightly derided for being manipulative and meaningless?  When did people start falling for that nonsense?

None of that has anything to do with what I posted unless...wait...have I been arguing with a bot?

I have yet to see anyone argue that feeding children no food versus junk food is an improvement.Why are you treating this issue like feeding the kids junk food or letting them starve are the only two options? Programs like WIC provide healthy food to parents and can not be used for junk food for instance.

I don&#39;t know the solution, but I know giving the government more and more power/money leads to worse outcomes, not better.I don&#39;t know about you but this is type of thing Republicans say while they take actions to make sure this is the end result, we get the government we deserve.  Lest I remind everyone Michelle Obama tried to give kids more vegetables and the Republicans flipped the fuck out, “Your America is turning into a nanny state thanks to the Obama administration’s efforts to rein in the junk food industry,” said Sean Hannity.Mike Bloomberg wanted to ban giant sodas and Sara Palin get&#39;s on stage with a Big Gulp.  Elect clowns and expect clownery.The expanded Child Tax Credit reduced childhood poverty to it&#39;s lowest level ever before it was rescinded.  Social Security keeps 1/3 of our elderly from living in destitution and allows their children to produce more output during their working years.   The government can do lots of good if we elect people who believe it can do those things.

You failed to read or understand what he wrote if you think that&#39;s the takeaway.

If you have a smoking gun which proves politics is purely a show for our benefit, present it. Otherwise fuck off with your equivocation.

I pick and choose how I respond, but let&#39;s clarify something; do you really think millions if not billions wouldn&#39;t be political theatre?

Oh.  Oh princess.  How very &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot; you are.  Now run along and eat your crayons, the adults are talking.

Fuck right off with this both-sides shit. When&#39;s the last time the Democrats ever advocated putting children in jail, separated from the parents, en masse, or sending thousands of secret police to terrorize and murder the citizens of cities run by republicans (no, they no longer deserve to be capitalized)? Oh, that&#39;s right: NEVER. That&#39;s because Democrats actually do care about the people and the rule of law. They aren&#39;t a crazy death cult run by a tyrannic fascist. Do they have problems? Sure. Are they on

It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment to look at moral trends, and consider what activities which are currently legal may become illegal in the future.

e.g. If you were playing this game in the past, you might have correctly predicted dog fighting, or legal descrimination based on race.

Looking 100 years into the future, we might wonder about the sport of boxing, or factory farming of animals. But I hadn&#39;t considered ultra-processed food...

Oh, no one wants to play that game, or we&#39;d be having a serious discussion about hormone therapy and medically unnecessary surgeries ( maiming ) for minors.Won&#39;t be 100 years though, more like 10, maybe 20.Imagine what kind monsters people in the future will think we were for allowing that to be done to little ones.  And they&#39;ll be 100% accurate.There is certainly precedent for medical procedures which were introduced, but later banned. The lobotomy is such an example.

You&#39;ll find a definition including abstract characteristics as well as examples.

The definition isn&#39;t particularly coherent.  Cane and beet sugar are Group II, but &quot;sugar, oils, and fats for domestic use&quot; are Group IV?  Which is it?  Ice cream is Group IV despite being milk (Group), cream, sugar, and salt (all Group II)... are they complaining about the often-present emulsifier ,which as a vegetable extract should also be Group II?  Certainly it should be Group III at worst.  Sausage is Group IV despite the processing in sausage being pretty much purely physical; perhaps they don&#39;t know

It&#39;s coherent enough. When classifying a broad spectrum like foods, you will always find ambiguity at the edges. If you want specificity you face to make a definitive list. But if you want definitions, you have to abstract, and abstractions are always imperfect.

The question is whether the classifications are meaningful and useful, and I would argue that they are.

For your specific comparison of sugar, oils, and fats, when read in context it&#39;s pretty clear what is meant.

Group II of these are derived in a single step. Olives to olive oil. Milk to butter. Cane sugar to rock sugar. Group IV require further processing. White sugar, hydrogenated oils, etc.. these things are not direct derivations. They require additional processing.

If you cook them at home you end up with a different ingredient list and a very different Nova classification.Your problem is that you&#39;re attempting to categorise the foodstuff itself rather than what Nova classification is actually about: the way the specific food stuff is made.You can have a Bolognese sauce that is group IV or you can have it group I, just like many of

&quot;Ultra-processed foods include... sweets and chocolates...&quot;

Chocolate is included... I don&#39;t know what you think you&#39;re reading but you&#39;re reading it wrong.

I believe this is the link to the original article, it appears to be open access / no paywall.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.co... [wiley.com]

I need to read it again, but it feels like it reads more like an essay or whitepaper than a scientific article.  I am not sure the author actually conducted any testing or comparing tobacco to ultra-processed food.  I am also not sure the author offered a concrete definition of ultra-processed food.  The author does identify foods that are very high in simple carbohydrates (e.g. candy, M&Ms, Peeps), but I don&#39;t think anyone believes that candy is healthy.

I wish the author had provided their working definition of ultra-processed food.  The way I understand, even things like home-made bread qualify as ultra-processed food.  The problem is that unless you are eating only raw fruits and vegetables; pretty much everything else is processed to some degree, even if it just involves cooking.  I want to understand how ultra-processing is being conceived other than &quot;traditional&quot; junk food, or just anything to come out of an &quot;evil&quot; industrial kitchen.

Well, exactly.  I am not trying to defend crap food, but really, what are we talking about?  Pancakes?  Homemade grilled cheese (defining, for the moment, &quot;american cheese&quot; as cheese)?  Breakfast cereals?  Hot breakfast oatmeal? &quot;TV&quot; dinners?  (of which there are a vast range, from obviously shite to plausibly good.)

One would hope that there&#39;s a gap between, say, bagged pork rinds vs no-frills baked pretzels.  Just saying &quot;:UPF bad, not-UPF good&quot; is unavailing, especially if there&#39;s no consumer useful defin

&quot;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have more in common with cigarettes than with fruit or vegetables&quot;

I&#39;d love to see the author of the study eat 3 meals of cigarettes a day and get back to us. The control group (average Americans) will definitely live longer.

>&quot;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have more in common with cigarettes than with fruit or vegetables&quot;

Well, I, for one, don&#39;t plan to smoke my Cheez-Its.  (But, they have to be the &quot;extra toasty&quot; ones, those are really good).

There is absolutely nothing wrong with food that has been processed via a variety of means and the term is confusing for EVERYONE as a result. Did you have a tofu wrap with kimchi? Congrats, you had &quot;ultra-processed&quot; food and now your life is in danger. (Ok, no, not really.) Let&#39;s just look at what the article itself says:

Ultra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.* Fizzy drinks - Carbonation isn&#39;t a problem, it&#39;s the sugar.* Sweets - Apricots are not a problem, candy is.* Fast Food - Quickly produced grilled chicken is a non-issue. High-salt, high-fat meets and sugary breads are.* Mass-Produced Bread - There&#39;s nothing wrong with making a LOT of bread. The cake-levels of sugars are.What do these foods contain? Ultra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.* There&#39;s nothing bad about fruit juice concentrates except when they use insufficient water to reconstitute the concentrate or if they remove too much pulp.* Dextrose? Dextrose is used to treat hypoglycemia.* Golden Syrup? Again... It&#39;s sugar!* Gluten? Gluten is the problem? WTF?* What in the world is wrong with dried egg whites?* Monosodium glutamate is just a salt!!Why does it matter? Ultra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.And here&#39;s where we get to what it&#39;s ACTUALLY all about-- HIGH salt, HIGH sugar, HIGH fat. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the problem.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about mass produced food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about dehydrated food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about quickly produced food or with food with a long preparation process.The ONLY ACTUAL problems are the unhealthy levels of SALT, SUGAR, and FAT.So again, I assert We Need to Drop the Term &quot;Ultra-Processed&quot;. Most people don&#39;t understand it and thus it&#39;s a useless term to improve peoples&#39; lives.

Ultra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.And here&#39;s where we get to what it&#39;s ACTUALLY all about-- HIGH salt, HIGH sugar, HIGH fat. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the problem.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about mass produced food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about dehydrated food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about quickly produced food or with food with a long preparation process.The ONLY ACTUAL problems are the unhealthy levels of SALT, SUGAR, and FAT.So again, I assert We Need to Drop the Term &quot;Ultra-Processed&quot;. Most people don&#39;t understand it and thus it&#39;s a useless term to improve peoples&#39; lives.

We have ample evidence that a large number of additives used in UPF production are unhealthy, in some cases actually carcinogenic.You seem to base your view on what you want to believe is true to help self-justify what you eat. Science doesn&#39;t work like that.

Van Tulleken&#39;s &quot;Ultra-Processed People&quot; covers these points, here are some examples, off the top of my head:

> * Fizzy drinks - Carbonation isn&#39;t a problem, it&#39;s the sugar.When a drink is served cold and is carbonated - you are less sensitive to its sugar contents. In other words, you can smuggle a larger quantity of sugar into your body this way. If, in contrast, you let that fizzy drink reach room temperature and get rid of the fizz - it would taste too sweet.

This is an example of a deliberate design me

I&#39;ve seen any number of articles recently bewailing the evils of UPF&#39;s, but nothing that says exactly WHAT counts as an ultra-processed food.  Wheaties?  Fully-cooked sausages (e.g. GIlbert&#39;s)?  Hot dogs?  Pretzels?   or just what exactly?  There&#39;s no point in telling people that X is bad if you don&#39;t properly define what X is.

Did you bother to read any of the articles or their sources, or search the internet?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_classification [wikipedia.org]

I did.  Did you?  and anyone looking for &quot;UPF&quot; isn&#39;t likely to land on &quot;Nova classification&quot;, not that the latter will tell them anything useful.

So I googled &quot;what are ultra processed foods&quot;, and the nova system was the second image, and referenced from the pages of the top three results. I&#39;m not sure why you think it&#39;s unlikely.

And what do you find to not be useful about the definitions? They&#39;re about as useful as classification definitions can be. They don&#39;t tell you what to do with the information, but that&#39;s not the point of the classification. You need guidance that references it.

Sure, it is easier to get the people in charge to agree to collect more (sin) taxes, but it would remove the barely affordable sustenance options for many.

There are really simple and obvious reasons people avoid unprocessed foods today.  Solve those instead.  Don&#39;t poison the existing imperfect solutions out of some self righteous messiah complex.

Create a way to know exactly how ripe or &quot;good&quot; something will be (before I buy it).  Make it like buying something off a shelf.  I always get the same thing I pai

&quot;Why aren&#39;t we training every public school student in safe food handling, and giving them a certificate for it?&quot;

That class was called home economics but was only open to girls. The boys were in shop. Really both genders should have been in both classes, but the school year was pretty full already.

But I couldn&#39;t get the damn cornflakes to stay lit!

Homemade bread is ultraprocessed, but it&#39;s unquestionably good for you.Wonder bread is equally ultraprocessed, and is far less healthful.

It&#39;s not the processing, it&#39;s non-food ingredients like chemical preservatives and food dyes made of petroleum.

Stop giving processing a bad name. Many processes, like cooking, generally *improve* the quality, safety, and healthfulness of food.

It is impossible to know why you got cancer. It could be the school lunch served to you when you were in middle school or a the cold cuts your grandparent&#39;s generation ate their entire life but just happened to give you stomach cancer.

It could be... The Sun. (Which, unfortunately, is a hard thing to regulate.)

Jesus was NOT a socialist.  Socialism (and Communism) are systems of GOVERMENT that take goods from some individuals to give to others, by force if necessary.Not actually true. That is the definition of state socialism [wikipedia.org], which is the variety of socialism that we see at the country-scale in the 20th century, but, no, it&#39;s just one type of socialism. Take a look at Bakunin or Kropotkin for some varieties of socialism that are diametrically opposite. Not actually workable ideas, mind, but completely different from state socialism. (Bakunin, for what it&#39;s worth, detested Marx&#39;s ideas. His comment about Marx&#39;s &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; was that it would quickly devolve into dictatorship, period. Got that one right!)

Jesus is pretty clear that the kingdom of heaven demands that you give your wealth away in order to enter it. Is Jesus not the king and ultimate goverment of the earth? Does he not tell you repeatedly to give up your possessions to the poor? If that isn&#39;t like socialism it is even less like capitalism. Many times have I seen rich people read passages from the bible that directly say &quot;Do not be rich&quot;. The words seem to flow around them like a vapor.

The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#39;s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

I mean, Jesus wasn&#39;t anything. He never existed IRL. But, setting that aside, if we look at the &quot;teachings&quot; of Jesus as a whole, it is a serious stretch to believe that Jesus would be a capitalist. If anything, he&#39;d be a Socialist or a full-out Communist.&quot;Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.&quot; - Matthew 19:24Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and

Many places have limitations on what you can add to a cigarette, specifically flavourings. There are also restrictions on advertising and who can buy them.

The US FDA has proposed limiting nicotine content.

The flavoring bans are ostensibly a &quot;think of the children&quot; thing.  The idea being that it&#39;s illegal to market cigarettes to children, and flavors can be perceived as trying to appeal to children.  The stupid thing about that is, it&#39;s also kind of an admission that the age gates don&#39;t work, because if the product isn&#39;t supposed to be sold to anyone under 21, the fact that flavors have been added should be irrelevant.

Ironically, a similar argument was made against alcoholic beverages with fruity flavors and

You forgot the most important part, the extremely high taxes on cigarettes which would most definitely be effective in reducing consumption of ultra processed food.

Except eating healthy doesn&#39;t at all have to be expensive. Canned and frozen veggies are very affordable and so is fresh as long as one is buying in season and not buying exotic stuff. I don&#39;t know where this myth came from that one needs to eat expensive food to eat healthy but there&#39;s zero truth to it.

One can certainly attempt to kill the poor. But when facing an existential crisis, I can&#39;t really blame the poor if they rise up and kill the middle class and rich. Even if that includes me, especially if it does!So I would rather avoid peak capitalism scenarios that end in civil unrest and myself being first against the wall when the revolution comes.Other political chatterboxes I interact with tell me I&#39;m a socialist for not wanting to be murdered by the proletariat.If everyone has a job and enough to eat

People often misunderstand the works of Karl Marx. You, sir, understand perfectly. I mean, he was wrong about the whole Communism thing, but the idea that if the rich piss the poor off enough, the poor will rise up and kill them is pretty solid and has happened plenty of times. It&#39;s starting to happen right now again, it seems.

From Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis to Maine, ICE agents are leaving a trail of destruction and fear. The most important harms they leave behind are broken lives, injuries, and deaths. There are already important efforts in the works to hold them to account via criminal investigations and civil actions. Yet these actions will be hard to win. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are wreaking another, second-string harm, this one involving the destruction of personal property. This damage flagrantly violates another constitutional provision—and there is a clear and uncluttered legal pathway to address those harms that so far has not been invoked. It’s past time it was used.

ICE’s violent enforcement actions often involve the needless destruction of people’s personal property. The Fifth Amendment’s takings clause makes such property destruction unconstitutional. Demanding damages for these harms may seem to miss the mark, in the sense that they do not address the features that make ICE’s strategies so horrifying, specifically the physical violence against human beings. This is quite fair. But often there will simply be no other practical way for ICE’s victims to obtain redress, such that an action for property harms may well be the best, even the only, route available.

Take the case of Minneapolis resident ChongLy “Scott” Thao. In January, ICE agents battered down Thao’s door, dragged him out in his underwear, and handled him in a degrading, contemptuous, and very likely racist manner—before confirming that he was, as he said, a U.S. citizen. Thao surely ought to be able to seek damages for the grave harms to his person and dignity. The conservative Roberts court, however, has made such damages actions—called Bivens suits—extremely hard to win thanks to doctrines such as “qualified immunity.” The latter is a misleading name, as it is practically insurmountable in many cases. Some federal courts of appeals have even ruled that ICE agents are categorically immune from constitutional damages actions under all circumstances.

But the facts of Thao’s case are unlikely to prove outliers in coming weeks. ICE has developed an internal policy memo telling its officers that they can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant. This policy, which perversely echoes the British colonial abuses that precipitated the American Revolution, invites the repetition of Thao’s ordeal around the nation. A key way to fight back would be lawsuits under the takings clause.

This is not the only kind of serious property damage ICE habitually engages in, though. From Arizona to Maine to Colorado, immigration agents have stopped people’s cars, smashed in windows, dragged out drivers, and left cars running on the street—in effect inviting their theft. In other cases, ICE agents have rammed private vehicles, using a tactic most police departments have banned as too dangerous, to make an arrest.

But there is an explicit constitutional prohibition against the federal government destroying property without “just compensation.” Again, it’s the takings clause. While it’s usually applied when the federal government exercises eminent domain and takes title to land, the takings clause also covers the government’s outright destruction of personal property. What’s more, there are no barriers to recovery akin to qualified immunity.

Applying the takings clause to the destruction of personal property by lawless federal agents makes a certain historical sense. At least one influential legal treatise–writer of the founding period, St. George Tucker, opined that the takings clause had been threaded into the Bill of Rights as a response to the military destruction of personal property during the Colonial-era wars. If Thao or other victims of ICE brought suit, that is, they’d arguably be walking in hallowed footprints.

Would courts be willing to entertain these claims today? Some courts of appeals have dismissed takings claims against state and local police on the theory that the takings clause only applies when government takes title to land. This is flat wrong. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a federal regulation requiring a raisin farmer to destroy a portion of his crop is a per se taking. The government destruction of things, that is, counts as a taking.

Other courts, more plausibly, have held that a takings claim can be brought only when a police officer is acting unreasonably in destroying property. In Thao’s case, and many others, agents’ claim that they are acting “reasonably” would be thwarted by body-cam footage, or the fact that their tactics violate well-established policing practices, such as don’t ram a suspect’s car to get it off the road. Indeed, there are now a trail of court victories on behalf of people whose houses have been damaged by SWAT raids.

If there was any doubt about such claims, it should be extinguished by the fact that Congress has identified precisely how such cases can be brought. It has designated the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as the right tribunal for takings claims over $10,000. Smaller claims are brought in the relevant district court. In both kinds of cases, federal law establishes a fee-shifting mechanism: A win for a plaintiff means that the government has to pay attorney’s fees. This fee-structure means that takings claims should be available even when litigants lack upfront fees for a lawyer, but have an otherwise strong case.

Property damage is, no doubt, a decidedly venal sin in comparison to the grave violations of civil and human rights for which ICE is responsible. But it is a sad fact that Congress and the courts have made it well-nigh impossible to sue if you are brutalized or injured by ICE—and straightforward to prevail if your personal property is busted up. In a moment of less acute emergency, there are good reasons to fix that topsy-turvy situation. In the bleak midst of ICE’s violent blizzard, we must use every lawful tool at our disposal to hit the brakes on its lawless destruction and desecration of Americans’ homes and lives.

            <div id="article-text">Last month, I traveled to Minneapolis to report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence. While there, I documented intense struggles between local residents and federal agents—an important story with deadly consequences. But I also heard constantly about another, equally important story: that of the thousands of immigrants who’ve made Minnesota their home and are trying to survive the federal occupation. Reaching people living in those conditions is difficult, precisely because their well-being depends on them staying out of sight. But after multiple attempts, I was connected with a man who has been hiding in his home for fear of being detained. To protect his identity, privacy, and safety, identifying details have been omitted. What follows is his account, originally told in Spanish, of his time in hiding—and the federal abduction of his son.

The most difficult day of my life was the day they grabbed my son.

I am from Guatemala. I left because economically, there is very little opportunity. Delinquency is high. You work, you get paid very little, and there are people waiting to rob you. I left my wife and my children and came here with my son so I could earn a little more and take care of my family back home.

We’ve lived in Minneapolis for seven years. Before the ICE raids intensified, my life was relaxing but full of work. I worked hard, and left my house knowing I would come back. I could walk outside during the day and at night. I slept for a few hours, made my breakfast, made my lunch to take to work the next day; that’s the life of an immigrant. Sundays were my only day of rest, but even then I worked doing laundry, grocery shopping, going to Walmart, talking to people, getting to know the community.

When I arrived in Minneapolis, it felt like my country. I saw people who looked like me. I got used to the snow, the cold, working in all conditions. We worked hard for a few good months to save, then kept working through the winter anyway.

I used to watch Americans buy a few things—soap, bread, eggs, milk. But Hispanic families? We filled two full carts. We move the economy. We move money here, and we send money back to our families. That’s why it hurts so much to be seen like this now. We are not delinquents. We are hard workers. We work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sometimes we work with lamps on our foreheads. All to help the families we left behind.

On Jan. 6, we woke up early. I didn’t want to leave the house and go to work that day. I told my son that, but he said he wanted to go. He left around 8:45 in the morning. At 10 a.m., his boss called me and asked, “Where is your son? Have you heard from him?” That’s when my heart dropped.

As a father, I wanted to go out and look for him. I wanted to do everything possible. But seeing how things are, I had to avoid going outside. Later, I was watching the news. I saw a video from detention. I saw my son there, chained by his feet. That’s when I knew. That’s when I realized they had him. That image stays with you.

My son is 36 years old. He is a special-needs person. He doesn’t talk. After suffering a stroke, his tongue is stuck. One of his eyes is dead. He works because he needs to work. Here in Minneapolis, he was in medical therapy, learning how to use his jaw again. He was being treated by a doctor here. This is where we were helping him. This is where he was receiving care.

And suddenly, we knew nothing. They told me he was going to be put on a plane to Guatemala on Jan. 19. Then they said he would be released the next day. Then the day passed, and nothing happened. I called the Guatemalan Consulate. They told me they had sent a lawyer to see him. That was a lie. I called another consulate. They told me he was in Louisiana. Then they said no, now he is in El Paso, Texas.

I haven’t received one call from him. Not one.

Not knowing where your family is, that is the hardest thing. Especially now, with the way they are treating us. They are not treating us like people. They are treating us worse than how people in Guatemala treat animals when they go hunting. They grab you by the throat. They throw you to the ground. They put their knees on your neck. That’s how they are treating us. Like animals.

I see on the news that people have died in detention centers in El Paso. I ask myself, as a father: What is happening to him? Where is my son really? If I have to show his photo on television, in the news, in other countries, I will do it. I will not be quiet.

I have cried bitterly. I have cried in solitude. I have gotten to my knees and prayed to God. Only God can do justice. God is big. God is good. God will help. But my body is not the same body as before. My mind is not the same anymore.

For almost two months now, I have been closed inside my home. I don’t go to work. I don’t go to the store. Every time someone knocks on the door, I ask myself, who is it? There is a lot of tension. There is a lot of fear. We need psychologists to help us with everything that is happening. This isn’t easy. And on top of that, we have to use our little resources for this.

I am an older person. I have cholesterol. I have high blood pressure. I recently suffered from pneumonia. I need medication. I always liked having extra medicine in case of emergencies, so at night I wouldn’t worry. Food is a basic necessity. Thank God, He put angels in my path. People with papers get groceries for me. My church and my pastor help me. People in the community help us get what we can’t go out to get. When you know God, God doesn’t stop providing.

I don’t have a bank account. I save my money in cash for emergencies, because you never know. Every week, you work, you get a check, and you have to decide between food, bills, and sending money to your family. You always put something away, because you never know. God told me to save for difficult times. Difficult times are here.

We got used to the freedoms here. Now there is no liberty. We are isolated. Minneapolis feels like a war zone. People tell you, if you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. What ICE is doing is terrorism. This was a beautiful country. Where did that country go? It hurts to be seen like this now.

If they detain me, I won’t fight. These people have no compassion. They see us as criminals. The president says we are criminals. But we haven’t killed anyone. We came here to work. If the day comes, I will go back to my country. But not this way. Not as a delinquent. One day we may return. But this isn’t the way.

If I could say something to ICE or to President Donald Trump, I would say this: God is the owner of all of this. Not you. God Almighty is the only owner. One day He will come. And I hope they regret everything they are doing right now. Only God is responsible for justice.

As I prepared this story on Tuesday, a local contact texted me with news: “FYI his son arrived in Guatemala today, finally after 20 days of waiting.”

The last remaining U.S.–Russia nuclear arms–control treaty, New START, expires on Feb. 5—and, with less than 48 hours to go, President Donald Trump hasn’t done anything about it.

Asked about the impending deadline in his New York Times interview last month, Trump replied, “If it expires, it expires. We’ll do a better agreement,” maybe one that brings in China—which has a growing nuclear arsenal—as a participant.

If past is precedent, a new treaty would take at least a year to negotiate; if China takes part, something that has never happened before, it would take many years.

In the meantime, we may well see the renewal of a nuclear arms race, reversing a trend of the past half-century. The stunning thing is that, by all accounts, Trump and his advisers haven’t so much as held a conversation about the possibility or its implications for U.S. policy or the safety of the world.

It’s worth recalling that when Trump scuttled the Iran nuclear deal back during his first term as president, he said that he—master of the “art of the deal”—would goad Tehran into accepting a “better” deal. This never happened. There is no reason to believe, especially given Washington’s tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing, that he’ll bring about a superior substitute for New START either.

New START—the acronym stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty—was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in February 2011, as a follow-on to previous accords, START and START II, which George H.W. Bush had signed with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, respectively. The Obama–Medvedev treaty went further than the earlier accords, forcing each side to cut its long-range nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads—a 30 percent reduction from START II’s limits, a 75 percent cut from START’s. It also allowed very intrusive on-site inspections of each side’s arsenals to verify that they were in compliance.

New START was set to expire after 10 years. Obama envisioned negotiating, well before then, a follow-on accord that would make still deeper cuts, including short- and medium-range missiles. But it never happened. The U.S. had long ago dismantled almost all of those weapons, for good reason, while Russia retained about 2,000, which it wanted to keep to counter NATO’s superiority in conventional armies (just as, during much of the Cold War, the U.S. and NATO kept thousands of nukes in Western Europe to counter the Soviet Union’s conventional edge). Plus, after Putin returned as Russia’s president and started rattling sabers in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere, the political climate for arms control chilled.

So when Joe Biden came to the White House in January 2021, New START—which he had worked on as Obama’s vice president—was about to expire. The treaty did allow a one-time five-year extension, so he and Putin quickly made it so.* Diplomatic channels were still very much open (Putin wouldn’t launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine for another year); both leaders saw it in their interests to keep a cap on a possible arms race.

Now five years have passed, and here we are. Putin recently proposed a quick accord—it could be drawn up and signed in very short order—to extend New START’s ceilings on nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and warheads for another year. Trump has not replied, at least not in public.

Here’s why this is important: A major purpose of arms control is to put boundaries on the threat—to keep each side from spinning and acting upon “worst-case scenarios” of how many nukes the other side might build and, therefore, how many nukes it needs to build in response.

For instance, in the late 1950s, the intelligence branch of the U.S. Air Force estimated that the Soviet Union would have 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles by 1962, maybe by as soon as 1961. By contrast, the U.S. would have just 65 ICBMs. In other words, there would soon be a “missile gap.” As a result, the Pentagon proposed, and Congress readily approved, our own crash buildup of missiles (which would be built by the U.S. Air Force).

Then, in 1960, photos taken above the USSR, first by U-2 spy planes and then by Discoverer spy satellites, revealed a different story. Independent intelligence analysts at the CIA estimated that the Soviets would have just 50 ICBMs in the next couple of years. In reality, the Soviets turned out to have just four ICBMs. There was a missile gap, but very much in the United States’ favor.

However, by this time, the Pentagon had already embarked on its crash missile buildup. Air Force officers were still arguing they needed 2,000 ICBMs over the long haul. White House aides to President John F. Kennedy argued that the new intelligence data suggested the nation could get by with just 600. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told Kennedy that, as a political compromise, to keep the Joint Chiefs of Staff from rebelling, he needed 1,000. Kennedy, who at the time was inclined to side with his Cabinet secretaries, approved 1,000.

As a result, the Soviets, seeing this American buildup, responded with a very real buildup of their own. Had there been better information, a more bounded threat, the arms race of the missile age might have been squelched before it took off.

The parallels with current times aren’t precise. Intelligence analysts don’t have to rely so much on guesswork. Even without on-site inspection, they can learn or infer a great deal—almost everything—from high-resolution satellites, communications intercepts, and a wide range of technical and human sources. (In 2023, Putin stopped allowing on-site inspections, but the U.S. still has very high confidence that he hasn’t deployed more nuclear weapons than New START allows.)

Still, one can easily imagine even today’s officers and analysts with vested interests or hawkish inclinations arguing that, freed from the restraints of New START, the Russians could build many more missiles and warheads—and, therefore, we need to build many more to match. It’s even easier to imagine Russian officers and analysts, who tend to be more paranoid than ours, doing the same. A stepped-up arms race is likely indeed.

This action-reaction complex stems not just from a psychological need to appear equal (though that is part of what goes on). There’s a tangible element here too. The planners at U.S. Strategic Command—and probably their counterparts in Russia—maintain a “counterforce” strategy. Most of our missiles are aimed at their missiles—and, most likely, vice versa. The warheads on our missiles also have sufficient accuracy and explosive power to destroy or disable the Russian missiles in their blast-hardened silos—and, again, most likely vice versa.

By the logic of this strategy, if the Russians build more missiles, we have to build more missiles too—so that we’re still able to hit all of the targets.

This is where the new dimension of arms-race scenarios comes into focus—China. When Obama and Medvedev signed New START 15 years ago, China barely had enough nuclear weapons to warrant attention. Now they have about 600; within a few years, they’ll approach parity with the U.S. and Russia. Nobody quite knows why; Chinese officers, who used to write a fair amount about nuclear strategy, have gone silent. Whatever the motive, if China is seen as an adversary, and if counterforce is still a centerpiece of U.S. nuclear strategy, then we don’t have enough warheads to cover all of the targets.

This is why some defense analysts say it’s just as well that New START is expiring. They say that the U.S. needs more nuclear weapons than New START permits.

But this is where the discussion should begin, not end. Do we really need to be able to destroy all of the Russian and Chinese missile sites? This is a two-part question: First, what are the chances that we’ll face not just war but all-out nuclear war against Russia and China simultaneously? Second, do we need to have the ability to knock out all of their missile sites in order to deter nuclear war?

Deterring nuclear war is the aim here. If the plan is to fight, maybe win a nuclear war, how does that game go? Would we launch a first strike against Russia and China? If we did, and we aimed to destroy their missile silos, would they launch the missiles on warning, before our warheads struck—in which case, they’d inflict more damage on us than might otherwise be the case? Finally, there’s “nuclear winter“—the theory that a certain number of nuclear explosions (the calculations vary, but some are as low as a few hundred) will ignite so many fires and kick up so much dust that much of life on Earth will end. There is no winner in this war.

These are controversies that have gone on for many decades. In previous administrations, the Pentagon, StratCom, the National Security Council, and sometimes the president himself, have engaged in this discussion. They have published a Nuclear Posture Review, in classified and unclassified forms, that spelled out the policy.

Trump has not done this. It is very unlikely that he or anyone else at a high level has discussed this at all, or is even aware of the dilemmas and imponderables. Nor is there likely to be a discussion of this sort in the next few years. In the meantime, Trump and Putin should sign a one-page document extending the terms of New START. It’s an imperfect accord, but it’s better than crying “Havoc!” and letting slip the dogs of a nuclear arms race.

Correction, Feb. 3, 2026: This piece originally misstated Obama’s exit date from office.

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Problems with a new digital European system for certifying fishing catches are hampering producers and delaying exports, according to ministers from several EU member states.

The European Commission introduced the digital version of Catch on January 10, replacing equivalent paper systems, with the aim of tackling illegal fishing.

However, a group of countries led by Spain say the digital system has &quot;significant technical and legal shortcomings,&quot; including a lack of integration with customs control systems and countries outside the EU that use its certification scheme.

Speaking at the EU&#39;s meeting of agriculture and fisheries ministers in Brussels on January 26, Hilde Crevits, vice-minister-president of Belgium&#39;s Flemish government, said that January 10 &quot;was too early to start.&quot;

The Catch system was holding up containers at ports including Antwerp and Zeebrugge, as well as at the UK border. &quot;Fisheries products don&#39;t have a very long shelf life,&quot; she said through an official translator.

Crevits added that a related new regulation that requires captains to record the weights caught for each type of fish in a digital logbook is difficult in Belgian fishing grounds with 20 species: &quot;You just try it.&quot;

One importer told The Financial Times that it had dozens of shipping containers of fish stuck in Rotterdam in the Netherlands as the Catch system was only clearing about half of its shipments.

&quot;We keep getting inexplicable error messages, server errors,&quot; an employee of the company told the newspaper, with the system not including all fish species and postal codes for all countries covered. The system also has size limits on uploading catch certificates from non-EU countries as PDFs, which the importer said were too low.

&quot;The technical gaps and lack of interoperability with third parties risk paralysing the imports and logistics of our companies without adding any benefits,&quot; Marco Canaparo, Italy&#39;s deputy permanent representative, told the agriculture and fisheries meeting.

In response, a European Commission official said some issues had been caused by a shift from patchy national implementations of the previous paper-based versions. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) employees who had their details exposed in a significant 2023 data breach will each receive £7,500 ($10,279) as part of a universal offer of compensation.

According to Liam Kelly, chief of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, £119 million ($163 million) has been ringfenced for compensation payments, which are expected to be issued from April.

&quot;This universal offer is substantial and major progress in this protracted matter,&quot; he said. &quot;For many officers, it will mean they are able to draw a line under the case and move on with their careers.&quot;

The 2023 data breach was considered one of the most significant and potentially dangerous lapses of data security in UK history.

The PSNI accidentally published a spreadsheet online as part of a response to a request made under Freedom of Information laws.

Officers faced serious safety risks after their personal details, including names and home addresses in some cases, were exposed online in the immediate aftermath.

Given the region&#39;s history of ethno-nationalist conflict, albeit rare in recent years, affected police officers reported myriad health issues in the months that followed.

The PSNI&#39;s mental health support services were soon stretched, and many faced delays in accessing the help they needed. Many staff were also not in a position where they could pay for private care.

An unspecified number relocated for their families&#39; safety, a report confirmed. A number of officers sought support to change their names, but were told that it was an unnecessary step.

Kelly said that while the Police Federation welcomes the PSNI&#39;s universal offer – a sum it hopes will bring an end to the majority of cases staff brought to it – others who feel particularly aggrieved will want to continue with legal proceedings.

&quot;This is not a one-size-fits-all offer,&quot; he said. &quot;We will see some colleagues who were left particularly vulnerable wishing to proceed with their legal cases.

&quot;Many of our officers felt extremely vulnerable by the information that was accidentally released. The upheaval forced some to relocate or install substantial home security systems to protect themselves and their families.

&quot;This Federation welcomes the universal offer. It will deliver welcome closure for many of them but we have to recognise the fact that for some of our colleagues, the damage caused by the breach will have longer-term effects and consequences.&quot;

Edwards Solicitors, which represents around 5,000 of the 9,483 officers affected by the breach, said:

&quot;We are delighted that after more than two years of hard work and considerable patience from our clients, the Chief Constable has finally been able to make an offer of compensation.

&quot;For many officers and staff, there will be considerable relief, and they will want to accept the offer and put this very unfortunate episode behind them.

&quot;For those who have been particularly badly affected, the offer may not be suitable and their cases will continue.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has paused flights of its workhorse Falcon 9 after a second stage failure resulted in the spent rocket tumbling uncontrollably back to Earth.

According to SpaceX: &quot;The second stage experienced an off-nominal condition during preparation for the deorbit burn.&quot;

The mission, which launched from California on February 2 at 1547 UTC, deployed another 25 Starlink satellites. The first stage was on its 31st flight and made a successful landing on the Of Course I Still Love You drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. The first two second stage engine burns were successful, and the satellites were deployed successfully. However, the deorbit burn did not happen, and the stage was instead passivated.

In this instance, passivation is the disposal of unused propellant to prevent an unexpected explosion during reentry. The deorbit burn ensures the re-entry can be targeted; in its absence, the stage re-entered the following morning. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell noted it was between 0130 UTC and 0330 UTC.

In its update, SpaceX said: &quot;Teams are reviewing data to determine root cause and corrective actions before returning to flight.&quot;

It is not the first time the second stage has posed problems for SpaceX. An explosion in July 2024 resulted in the loss of a payload of Starship satellites, and in February 2025, the company showered debris over Poland after an uncontrolled re-entry following a failed deorbit burn attempt.

SpaceX did not clarify how long the Falcon 9 is to remain grounded. The company&#39;s launch manifest has already been shuffled, with missions pushed back. The next Starlink mission was originally due to launch from Florida on February 6, but this has now been moved back to February 14.

More serious are the implications for the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), which was scheduled for February 11. The ISS is currently operating with a reduced crew due to the early return of Crew-11, so a delay is less than welcome.

During a briefing on the Artemis II post-Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA noted the investigation is ongoing. A space agency insider told The Register that SpaceX expressed confidence about the issue being resolved in time for the Crew-12 launch. However, the individual also cautioned that at least one entirely successful mission would likely need to be completed before loading a crew.

NASA also said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was involved in the investigation. The Register has contacted the FAA and will update this piece if it has anything to share. ®

            <div id="article-text">Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.

The Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:

In case some listeners didn&#39;t see the problem with that:

The US could turn us off inside one hour.

The Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump&#39;s second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.

As we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig&#39;s Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: &quot;We are free; now everyone must follow.&quot;

He noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn&#39;t without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:

We&#39;re in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.

In a later panel on &quot;Open Source and Economic Security,&quot; he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:

Don&#39;t look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.

So, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on &quot;nearly 100 percent&quot; of machines. It&#39;s using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.

Other speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn&#39;t mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU&#39;s vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: &quot;We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It&#39;s a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU&#39;s GDP.&quot; Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.

Companies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales&#39;s Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: &quot;Open source will succeed when we forget the word &#39;cost.&#39;&quot; IBM&#39;s Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open source:

We need code and speed, in place of coal and steel.

The Eclipse Foundation&#39;s Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla&#39;s earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, &quot;more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.&quot;

Portuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it&#39;s paying for:

If the money is public, the code should be public.

Of course, this isn&#39;t just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an &quot;intervention,&quot; talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.

To most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/aws_codec_patent_holders/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exclusive Amazon is warning users of its media services that it will not protect them against patent infringement claims relating to media codec technology supported by those services.

In a February 2 notification sent to relevant customers, the cloud giant says it is updating its Service Terms to specify it does not have &quot;defense or payment obligations for third-party patent claims against you related to use of these services for audio/video encoding, decoding, or transcoding.&quot;

The services in question are AWS Elemental MediaLive, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, Amazon Interactive Video Service, Chime SDK, Amazon GameLift Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Video Services.

Explaining the reason for this decision, AWS says some patent holders of media codec technology are &quot;increasingly refusing to license service providers like AWS,&quot; or else do not offer reasonable terms that will protect customers.

Some patent holders are demanding license payments &quot;that far exceed the value of their patented technology,&quot; according to AWS, in amounts that are &quot;not feasible for it to pay&quot; without incurring price increases for all customers of the affected services.

It seems from the notification that AWS has undertaken licensing discussions with patent holders of some of these media codecs, but, unable to reach a satisfactory agreement, opted to continue supporting the relevant tech anyway, while passing off legal liability to users.

The update from AWS claims this approach is commonplace across cloud media service providers, stating it believes this is &quot;the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances.&quot;

One AWS customers who tipped off The Register about the update alleged: &quot;This is AWS saying they are still going to use unlicensed software in their products, but just not pay the license, and if the owners of the unlicensed products come to get them, then they&#39;ll just pass on your details and say sue them instead.&quot;

The updated Service Terms are effective immediately. This change only applies to the listed media services, and AWS says it continues to offer uncapped intellectual property (IP) infringement protection to customers using other services.

But the update does not specify which codecs are affected, making it difficult for users to know if they are unwittingly exposing themselves to potential patent infringement claims.

AWS Elemental MediaLive alone supports a number of these, including AV1, H.264, H.265, MPEG-2, AAC, Dolby Digital, Dolby E, Dolby Digital Plus, MPEG Audio, and PCM, for example.

In the murky world of IP licensing, users can be led to believe their subscription for a product covers all the necessary licenses, only for some individual or company to pop up claiming to have a patent on some part of it and demanding back payments. Audio/video codecs are no exception, as the saga of Google&#39;s VP8 demonstrates.

We asked Amazon to comment, and if it could confirm which codecs may be potentially problematic.

A company spokesperson told us: &quot;If customers have any questions about what codecs are used by different AWS services, they can review our service documentation or contact AWS Support. We have also directed all customers with questions about the change to contact AWS Support for more information.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">The launch of the Artemis II mission to send humans around the Moon is fast approaching. The Register had a go at building Lego&#39;s latest SLS set and found it a lot of fun, particularly making whooshing noises as the rocket &quot;launches.&quot;

The 632-piece set uses Lego Technic elements to recreate NASA&#39;s Space Launch System (SLS). Turn the handle on the side, and the rocket rises from the launch pad, the solid rocket boosters separate, and eventually the upper stage detaches.

The box contains several plastic bags of Lego components (the paper bags used in other sets have yet to arrive here) and an annoying page of stickers. While the latter has long been a feature of Lego sets, its inclusion is frustrating because some pieces are pre-printed.

It takes approximately three to four hours to build at a leisurely pace and isn&#39;t particularly challenging – its target audience is aged nine and up.

That age range is important to keep in mind since the set is a little inaccurate. The core stage, for example, only has two engines rather than the four ex-Space Shuttle units that get thrown away with every launch of the real-world rocket.

The two engines at the base hint at a larger problem with this set: it only really works when viewed from the front. Look at it from the side or back, and it becomes evident that only half of the core stage is present due to the rail on which the rocket rises.

It is also a shame that Lego did not take the opportunity of disguising the rail as a launch tower or similar. The larger SLS set features a more detailed launch pad as well as a tower. The addition of some Technic wizardry to that would have been great.

Then again, the larger SLS set is considerably more expensive. This version comes in at $59.99 from the Lego store, a lot less than the $259.99 Lego wants for its bigger brother. In addition, while the larger set will take a lot longer to build, we&#39;d argue that this set has more post-build playability thanks to its moving parts.

While it is easy to pick on places where Lego has sacrificed technical accuracy for economy or scale, the educational value and sheer fun of the set outweigh the irritations. Turning the crank and watching the rocket do its stuff is quite something, and it gets over how the SLS works far better than a static display.

Not everyone gets to go to the Moon – a leftover Lego astronaut

Artemis II was scheduled to launch this month. The rocket is on the launch pad, but following a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) in which NASA&#39;s monster Moon rocket leaked hydrogen, managers announced that the agency is targeting March for lift-off. The mission won&#39;t enter lunar orbit, but it will fly humans around the Moon for the first time in more than half a century.

Lego&#39;s latest interpretation of the SLS is therefore well timed and gets a thumbs-up from this writer – and from younger brick enthusiasts who are far more interested in whooshing noises than mission briefings. ®

Warren is asking Google for more details about the kinds of data it will send to retail partners — and how much.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pressing Google for more information about its plans to build a checkout feature into its Gemini AI chatbot. In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Warren expresses concerns that the integration could allow Google and retailers “to exploit sensitive user data” or “manipulate consumers into spending more and paying higher prices.”

Last month, Google announced that it will soon allow users to buy products directly within Gemini through the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a standard it developed in partnership with Shopify, Target, Walmart, Wayfair, and Etsy. The UCP is supposed to make it easier for AI agents to communicate with retailers, but Warren wants to know just how much user information — and what kinds — Google plans on providing to retailers through this pipeline.

“Google already possesses unprecedented troves of user search and AI chat data, and such intimate data could be merged with both user data from other Google services and third-party retailer data to drive consumer behavior in an exploitative manner,” Warren writes, while also questioning whether Google will prioritize shopping results from retail partners over competitors.

Warren adds that the company has already admitted that it will use “sensitive data to help retailers upsell consumers into buying a more ‘premium’ product.” The letter cites a reply from Google on X in which it clarified that retailers will be able to “show additional premium product options that people might be interested in.”

In addition to a series of questions about user privacy, Warren is asking Google for information about how user data will affect pricing, as well as whether it will inform users when Gemini suggests a product “based on upselling objectives, advertising incentives, or sensitive user data.” Google has until February 17th to respond.

It won’t get new features, but it will still be available.

Adobe is no longer planning to discontinue Adobe Animate on March 1st. In an FAQ, the company now says that Animate will now be in maintenance mode and that it has “no plans to discontinue or remove access” to the app. Animate will still receive “ongoing security and bug fixes” and will still be available for “both new and existing users,” but it won’t get new features.

Many creators expressed frustration after Adobe’s original discontinuation announcement from Monday (here’s a Wayback Machine link), and the application is still used by creators like David Firth, the person behind the animated web series Salad Fingers. Now, Adobe says that “We are committed to ensuring Animate users always have access to their content regardless of the state of development of the application.”

An announcement email that went out to Adobe Animate customers about the discontinuation did “not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst within the community,” according to a Reddit post from Adobe community team member Mike Chambers.

Animate will be available in maintenance mode “indefinitely” to “individual, small business, and enterprise customers,” according to Adobe. Before the change, Adobe said that non-enterprise customers could access Animate and download content until March 1st, 2027, while enterprise customers had until March 1st, 2029.

            <div id="article-text">One Republican senator accused Netflix of creating the ‘wokest content in the history of the world.’

One Republican senator accused Netflix of creating the ‘wokest content in the history of the world.’

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was launched into the middle of a congressional culture war on Tuesday as he testified before a Senate subcommittee about the company’s attempt to buy a large part of Warner Bros Discovery.

The hearing before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee highlighted an array of traditional merger concerns on both sides of the aisle: that the deal could potentially raise costs for consumers, limit their theater experiences, or shrink the market for entertainment jobs. But a large chunk of the session also focused on Netflix’s allegedly “woke” programming, including content that features transgender characters.

Netflix is facing a competing bid from Paramount Skydance, run by CEO David Ellison, the son of President Donald Trump’s close ally and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. WBD has rejected Paramount’s offer, but Republicans are pushing to knock Netflix out of the running.

“Why in the world would we give a seal of approval or a thumbs up to make you the largest behemoth on the planet related to content?” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) asked. “It seems as though you have engaged in creating not only a monopoly of content, potentially, but the wokest content in the history of the world.”

After subcommittee Ranking Member Cory Booker (D-NJ) began his questioning following Schmitt by saying he’d get back to the topic of antitrust, Sen. Ashley Moody (R-FL) countered that the question of content was relevant to the topic at hand. “If there are folks across America who are already struggling with their limited options,” she said to the executives, “you’re proposing you become even larger, and I am just saying maybe that shouldn’t have been a joke, ‘let’s get back to antitrust,’ let’s truly talk about whether there are going to be options.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) made a hard pivot from his questioning on whether Netflix would commit to using union labor and pay residuals on streaming content to ask, “Why is it that so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology?” Hawley alleged that “almost half” of its content for minor children, excluding older teens, “promotes a transgender ideology agenda.” Sarandos said he didn’t know where that alleged number came from, and said that “Netflix has no political agenda of any kind.”

The French film Cuties featured heavily at the hearing as an example of oversexualized kids content. The movie, which was created as a commentary on the sexualization of young girls and Sarandos said is rated for mature audiences, not kids, became a symbol of Netflix’s alleged ideologically-driven library. Billionaire and Trump backer Elon Musk previously led a campaign against Netflix over shows like Dead End: Paranormal Park and The Baby-Sitters Club for featuring trans characters. GOP lawmakers also pointed to Netflix’s staff’s primarily Democratic-leaning political donations and content featuring LGBTQ+ characters as other examples of its bias.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked Sarandos and WBD Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer Bruce Campbell if they’d watched the Grammys this weekend (only Sarandos caught the “tail end”). “Are we right now on stolen land?” Cruz asked pointedly, referencing artist Billie Eilish’s speech opposing ICE, where she said, “no one is illegal on stolen land.” Both said they didn’t know. (The Grammys were broadcast on CBS, which is owned by Paramount Skydance.)

Ellison declined an invitation to attend the hearing because he believed it wouldn’t be helpful given the circumstances, Booker said. But Ellison met with lawmakers privately, and Booker described his conversation with him as “fruitful.” Paramount’s bid could raise some of the same concerns as Netflix’s, but Ellison’s father’s close tie to President Donald Trump would potentially assuage some of the content concerns for Republicans, and raise them for Democrats.

Booker raised deep concerns about whether any transaction would be reviewed fairly by independent enforcers under the Trump administration. Sarandos admitted he’d met with Trump shortly before the deal was announced, but that the deal was not discussed in detail and was not the primary purpose of the conversation. “I do not trust this administration in their evaluations, and I just pray to God that everything that you all hope might come should this move forward, that you all attested to, comes to pass,” Booker said.

AMD says it’s ready to support Microsoft launching its next Xbox as soon as next year.

Microsoft confirmed last year that it’s working on a next-gen Xbox console in partnership with AMD. Now, AMD is hinting that the next Xbox console, which will use custom AMD chips, could be launching in 2027.

“Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox, featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC, is progressing well to support a launch in 2027,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su on an earnings call today. The brief comment doesn’t confirm Microsoft will launch a new Xbox in 2027, but it does reveal that AMD is ready to support a launch then if Microsoft is also ready.

Microsoft entered a “strategic multi-year partnership” with AMD last year that includes the pair co-engineering silicon “across a portfolio of devices — including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands.” AMD and Microsoft are also working together to build the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming servers.

Microsoft has been teasing that the next-gen Xbox will be some type of hybrid console and PC, with the Xbox Ally devices serving as the initial groundwork towards this end goal. “The next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Xbox president Sarah Bond in October.

Microsoft hasn’t put a date on its next-gen Xbox, and documents that leaked as part of the FTC v. Microsoft case originally pointed towards a potential 2028 release. Those documents, which don’t reflect current plans anymore, mentioned using a custom AMD CPU as well as a co-designed AMD GPU.

Google filed its own appeal in the case last month.﻿

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice and the plaintiffs in the antitrust case against Google filed a cross-appeal, as the DOJ Antitrust Division announced in a post on X: “Today, the DOJ Antitrust Division filed notice that it will cross-appeal from the remedies decisions in its case against Google’s unlawful monopolization of internet search and search advertising.”

Just a few weeks ago, Google itself filed a notice to appeal and requested a pause on the remedies ordered by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta last year. Those remedies included requiring Google to share search data with its rivals and barring Google from making exclusive distribution deals for its search or AI products that could hinder distribution for competitors. However, Google was ultimately not required to sell its Chrome browser and wasn’t barred from paying distribution partners for preloading or premium placement of its search or AI products.

The DOJ’s cross-appeal suggests that neither party is fully satisfied with Judge Mehta’s ruling in the case, or at least the remedies ordered in September.

            <div id="article-text">After triggering an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, right-wing provocateur Nick Shirley is reportedly trying the same stunt in San Diego.

After triggering an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, right-wing provocateur Nick Shirley is reportedly trying the same stunt in San Diego.

After right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley’s viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota daycares he said were operated by Somali residents, Donald Trump’s administration responded by flooding the state with federal immigration agents and freezing funding for childcare services. (A judge ruled that the federal government must continue funding childcare subsidies, at least temporarily.) Now Shirley is back loitering outside daycares again, this time in California.

Over the weekend the 23-year-old posted a photo of himself with the caption “Hello California I’ve arrived.” Like with his last video, which featured a “source” later identified by The Intercept as a far-right onetime political candidate and lobbyist, Shirley seems to have had a local tour guide: Amy Reichert, a San Diego right-wing activist who unsuccessfully ran for local election. She said on X that she spent two days with Shirley “checking out learning centers” in the city. An accompanying image appears to show the two of them — a tripod-mounted phone in tow — outside a business.

Shirley’s playbook is essentially to pull public records on licensed childcare facilities, looking for citations or reports from state inspectors that he or his “sources” deem suspicious. He then physically visits daycare facilities and, in the case of the Minneapolis video, demands to “see the children” in the provider’s care. In Minneapolis, a refusal to let Shirley and his team into daycares was taken as evidence that the business was a sham — a claim unsupported by follow-up visits. (Perhaps a good daycare should not allow a random YouTuber near its kids?) Subsequent visits by state inspectors found that children were present at the daycares Shirley visited and that they were “operating as expected.”

Even though Shirley hasn’t yet published a video about San Diego, local childcare providers have already reported harassment. One provider told a local news outlet that she came home with children in her care only to find two men with a camera outside her house who finally left when she entered with the children.

“For over a month, Somali childcare providers have endured harassment by internet vigilantes who are dead set on exposing fraud in California’s highly regulated government child care system,” Doug Moore, executive director of United Domestic Workers of America said in a statement on Tuesday. “In the process, they are stalking and intimidating our members at their homes and places of business. These provocateurs are sowing seeds of hatred and distrust of our neighbors after taking cues from the president who referred to Somalians as ‘garbage.’ We treasure our Somali members and their contributions to our families, our union, and our communities.”

Shirley’s online presence is as much MAGA propaganda as it is algorithm bait — I described him last week as a “slopagandist” similar to yellow journalism of the late 19th century, updated for the influencer age. His content is repetitive, with rehashed video titles and recurring themes and filming locations. Unlike a true ideologue, Shirley will go wherever the audience analytics take him. At the moment, the algorithm is taking him to childcare centers.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <h2>What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132068/what-weve-been-getting-wrong-about-ais-truth-crisis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.
