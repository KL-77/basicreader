            <h2>Microsoft deletes blog telling users to train AI on pirated Harry Potter books</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/microsoft-removes-guide-on-how-to-train-llms-on-pirated-harry-potter-books/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following backlash in a Hacker News thread, Microsoft deleted a blog post that critics said encouraged developers to pirate Harry Potter books to train AI models that could then be used to create AI slop.

The blog, which is archived here, was written in November 2024 by a senior product manager, Pooja Kamath. According to her LinkedIn, Kamath has been at Microsoft for more than a decade and remains with the company. In 2024, Microsoft tapped her to promote a new feature that the blog said made it easier to “add generative AI features to your own applications with just a few lines of code using Azure SQL DB, LangChain, and LLMs.”

What better way to show “engaging and relatable examples” of Microsoft’s new feature that would “resonate with a wide audience” than to “use a well-known dataset” like Harry Potter books, the blog said.

The books are “one of the most famous and cherished series in literary history,” the blog noted, and fans could use the LLMs they trained in two fun ways: building Q&A systems providing “context-rich answers” and generating “new AI-driven Harry Potter fan fiction” that’s “sure to delight Potterheads.”

To help Microsoft customers achieve this vision, the blog linked to a Kaggle dataset that included all seven Harry Potter books, which, Ars verified, has been available online for years and incorrectly marked as “public domain.” Kaggle’s terms say that rights holders can send notices of infringing content, and repeat offenders risk suspensions, but Hacker News commenters speculated that the Harry Potter dataset flew under the radar, with only 10,000 downloads over time, not catching the attention of J.K. Rowling, who famously keeps a strong grip on the Harry Potter copyrights. The dataset was promptly deleted on Thursday after Ars reached out to the uploader, Shubham Maindola, a data scientist in India with no apparent links to Microsoft.

Maindola told Ars that “the dataset was marked as Public Domain by mistake. There was no intention to misrepresent the licensing status of the works.”

It’s unclear whether Kamath was directed to link to the Harry Potter books dataset in the blog or if it was an individual choice. Cathay Y. N. Smith, a law professor and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Program in Intellectual Property Law, told Ars that Kamath may not have realized the books were too recent to be in the public domain.

“Someone might be really knowledgeable about books and technology, but not necessarily about copyright terms and how long they last,” Smith said. “Especially if she saw that something was marked by another reputable company as being public domain.”

Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment. Kaggle did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.

On Hacker News, commenters suggested that it’s unlikely anyone familiar with the popular franchise would believe the Harry Potter books were in the public domain. They debated whether Microsoft’s blog was “problematic copyright-wise,” since Microsoft not only encouraged customers to download the infringing materials but also used the books themselves to create Harry Potter AI models that relied on beloved characters to hype Microsoft products.

Microsoft’s blog was posted more than a year ago, at a time when AI firms began facing lawsuits over AI models, which had allegedly infringed copyrights by training on pirated materials and regurgitating works verbatim.

The blog recommended that users learn to train their own AI models by downloading the Harry Potter dataset and then uploading text files to Azure Blob Storage. It included example models based on a dataset that Microsoft seemingly uploaded to Azure Blob Storage, which only included the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.

Training large language models (LLMs) on text files, Harry Potter fans could create Q&A systems capable of pulling up relevant excerpts of books. An example query offered was “Wizarding World snacks,” which retrieved an excerpt from The Sorcerer’s Stone where Harry marvels at strange treats like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs. Another prompt asking “How did Harry feel when he first learnt that he was a Wizard?” generated an output pointing to various early excerpts in the book.

But perhaps an even more exciting use case, Kamath suggested, was generating fan fiction to “explore new adventures” and “even create alternate endings.” That model could quickly comb the dataset for “contextually similar” excerpts that could be used to output fresh stories that fit with existing narratives and incorporate “elements from the retrieved passages,” the blog said.

As an example, Kamath trained a model to write a Harry Potter story she could use to market the feature she was blogging about. She asked the model to write a story in which Harry meets a new friend on the Hogwarts Express train who tells him all about Microsoft’s Native Vector Support in SQL “in the Muggle world.”

Drawing on parts of The Sorcerer’s Stone where Harry learns about Quidditch and gets to know Hermione Granger, the fan fiction showed a boy selling Harry on Microsoft’s “amazing” new feature. To do this, he likened it to having a spell that helps you find exactly what you need among thousands of options, instantly, while declaring it was perfect for machine learning, AI, and recommendation systems.

Further blurring the lines between Microsoft and Harry Potter brands, Kamath also generated an image showing Harry with his new friend, stamped with a Microsoft logo.

Smith told Ars that both use cases could frustrate rights holders, depending on the content in the model outputs.

“I think that the regurgitation and the creation of fan fiction, they both could flag copyright issues, in that fan fiction often has to take from the expressive elements, a copyrighted character, a character that’s famous enough to be protected by a copyright law or plot stories or sequences,” Smith said. “If these things are copied and reproduced, then that output could be potentially infringing.”

But it’s also still a gray area. Looking at the blog, Smith said, “I would be concerned,” but “I wouldn’t say it’s automatically infringement.”

Smith told Ars that, in pulling the blog, Microsoft “was probably smart,” since courts have only generally said that training AI on copyrighted books is fair use. But courts continue to probe questions about pirated AI training materials.

On the deleted Kaggle dataset page, Maindola previously explained that to source the data, he “downloaded the ebooks and then converted them to txt files.”

If Microsoft ever faced questions as to whether the company knowingly used pirated books to train the example models, fair use “could be a difficult argument,” Smith said.

Hacker News commenters suggested the blog could be considered fair use, since the training guide was for “educational purposes,” and Smith said that Microsoft could raise some “good arguments” in its defense.

However, she also suggested that Microsoft could be deemed liable for contributing to infringement on some level after leaving the blog up for a year. Before it was removed, the Kaggle dataset was downloaded more than 10,000 times.

“The ultimate result is to create something infringing by saying, ‘Hey, here you go, go grab that infringing stuff and use that in our system,’” Smith said. “They could potentially have some sort of secondary contributory liability for copyright infringement, downloading it, as well as then using it to encourage others to use it for training purposes.”

On Hacker News, commenters slammed the blog, including a self-described former Microsoft employee who claimed that Microsoft lets employees “blog without having to go through some approval or editing process.”

“It looks like somebody made a bad judgment call on what to put in a company blog post (and maybe what constitutes ethical activity) and that it was taken down as soon as someone noticed,” the former employee said.

Others suggested the blame was solely with the Kaggle uploader, Maindola, who told Ars that the dataset should never have been marked “public domain.” But Microsoft critics pushed back, noting that the Kaggle page made it clear that no special permission was granted and that Microsoft’s employee should have known better. “They don’t need to know any details to know that these properties belong to massive companies and aren’t free for the taking,” one commenter said.

The Harry Potter books weren’t the only books targeted, the thread noted, linking to a separate Azure sample containing Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which is also not in the public domain.

“Microsoft could have used any dataset for their blog, they could have even chosen to use actual public domain novels,” another Hacker News commenter wrote. “Instead, they opted to use copywritten works that J.K. hasn’t released into the public domain (unless user ‘Shubham Maindola’ is J.K.’s alter ego).”

Smith suggested Microsoft could have avoided this week’s backlash by more carefully reviewing blogs, noting that “if a company is risk averse, this would probably be flagged.” But she also understood Kamath’s preference for Harry Potter over the many long-forgotten characters that exist in the public domain. On Hacker News, some commenters defended Kamath’s blog, urging that it should be considered fair use since nonprofits and educational institutions could do the same thing in a teaching context without issue.

“I would have been concerned if I were the one clearing this for Microsoft, but at the same time, I completely understand what this employee was doing,” Smith said. “No one wants to write fan fiction about books that are in the public domain.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.30 of the Rocket Report! As I write this week’s edition, NASA’s Space Launch System rocket is undergoing a second countdown rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The outcome of the test will determine whether NASA has a shot at launching the Artemis II mission around the Moon next month, or if the launch will be delayed until April or later. The finicky fueling line for the rocket’s core stage is the center of attention after a hydrogen leak cut short a practice countdown earlier this month.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Who is actually investing in sovereign launch? No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena any time soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative, Ars reports. Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit, but they are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven’t committed the cash to back up their ambitions.

Ranking them... Ars examined how much international governments, specifically those without a present-day orbital launch capability, are investing in sovereign access to space. Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have committed the most government funding to homegrown launcher development. The fruits of the UK’s investment are in question after the failure of the Scottish rocket company Orbex, which we wrote about in last week’s Rocket Report. Other countries with real, although less credible, orbital launch programs include Brazil, Argentina, and Taiwan.

An update on one of Germany’s launch startups. German rocket builder Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) is making significant progress toward once again attempting an inaugural flight of its RFA One rocket, European Spaceflight reports. The company is moving forward with commissioning its launch pad at SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland as it works toward a hot fire test of the rocket’s first stage. The RFA One rocket is a 30-meter (98-foot) tall two-stage rocket designed to deliver payloads of up to 1,300 kilograms (2,866 pounds) to low-Earth orbit. The company is also developing an optional kick stage called Redshift that can be configured for a wide range of applications.

They’ve been here before... In August 2024, as the company was preparing for the inaugural flight of its RFA One rocket, an anomaly during a first-stage hot fire test caused the vehicle to burst into flames, resulting in the total loss of the stage. Over the last 18 months, the company has been manufacturing a replacement for the destroyed first stage and upgrading the vehicle’s upper stage to resume preparations for launch from SaxaVord Spaceport. RFA’s chief executive told European Spaceflight that the rocket’s booster is being transported from its German factory to the launch site in Scotland. That will be followed by the upper stage. “We are taking the time to do it properly. We remain aggressive, fast, and flexible, but the wild times before August 2024 are over,” Indulis Kalnins, the company’s CEO, said.

UAE launches hybrid rocket. The first hybrid rocket domestically developed in the United Arab Emirates launched on February 13, marking a significant step in the country’s push to build sovereign space and propulsion capabilities, the Khaleej Times reports. The sounding rocket, developed by the Technology Innovation Institute, reached an altitude of 3 kilometers (1.6 miles) during a test flight over the UAE desert, validating a fully UAE-designed and operated propulsion system for the first time. At the core of the mission was a hybrid propulsion engine combining nitrous oxide with a solid polyethylene-based fuel—a system that blends elements of solid and liquid rocket technologies.

Room to grow... “This achievement is the result of years of disciplined research, engineering, and iteration,” said Elias Tsoutsanis, chief researcher at the institute’s Propulsion and Space Research Center. “That capability is the foundation for everything that follows—higher altitudes, heavier payloads, and more complex missions, all from the UAE.” The UAE has a growing space program, having already sent an orbiter to Mars. The nation has a long-term goal of developing an indigenous orbital launch capability. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX restores full crew to ISS. A Crew Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on Saturday, and astronauts popped open the hatches a few hours later to bring the lab back to a full crew complement of seven astronauts and cosmonauts. The arrival of four new astronauts as part of the Crew-12 mission—Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway of NASA, Sophie Adenot of the European Space Agency, and Andrey Fedyaev of Roscosmos—came a day after their launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.

Recovering from something... One of the astronauts on the preceding SpaceX crew mission, Crew-11, experienced a health emergency on the ISS a few days into the new year. NASA made an unprecedented decision to bring them home early. NASA has not named the afflicted Crew-11 astronaut, but the flier is said to be recovering on Earth. The early departure of Crew-11 left just a single NASA astronaut, Chris Williams, aboard the space station. He had reached space on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in November, alongside two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev. The space station is a big place, and with much of the facility now more than two decades old, Williams had to spend most of his time on maintenance and monitoring activities. Because Crew-11 was brought home more than a month early, NASA and SpaceX scrambled to launch the Crew-12 vehicle a little sooner than expected to minimize the time Williams had to manage the large US segment of the station on his own.

SpaceX resumes Bahamas landings. For just the second time, a Falcon 9 booster returned to Earth Thursday night on a drone ship stationed among the islands of the Bahamas during a mission to deploy 29 Starlink satellites for SpaceX’s satellite Internet service. The booster landed on the drone ship parked near The Exumas less than 10 minutes after lifting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX landed a Falcon 9 booster in this location for the first time almost exactly one year ago, on February 18, 2025, without incident. But the Bahamian government raised environmental concerns after two Starships broke apart and dropped debris near the Bahamas last year, putting further Falcon 9 landings there on hold. The two entities have since come to an understanding, paving the way for this second booster to land near the island nation.

Back on station… SpaceX’s offshore rocket landings typically occur in international waters. The shift to territorial waters near the Bahamas allows SpaceX to launch into more types of orbits from Cape Canaveral. The Bahamian government hailed the original rocket landing agreement as an opportunity for the island nation to attract visitors and investment, with plans for a regular cadence of Falcon 9 booster returns near the Bahamas over the coming months.

LandSpace lays out plans for 2026. Chinese commercial launch firm LandSpace is targeting the second quarter of this year for a second orbital launch and booster recovery attempt of its Zhuque-3 rocket, followed by a reuse test in the fourth quarter, Space News reports. A LandSpace official provided the update in a presentation earlier this month before the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. The first launch of the Zhuque-3 rocket in December successfully reached orbit, but the first stage booster crashed near its downrange landing zone instead of descending to a controlled touchdown.

So close… Still, LandSpace got tantalizingly close to nailing an on-target landing. Something went wrong moments after ignition of the rocket’s engines for a final landing burn to slow for touchdown. The stage impacted around 40 meters off the center of a dedicated landing area in Wuwei County, Gansu province, some 390 kilometers (240 miles) downrange from the launch pad at the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China.

Another Chinese launch company rakes in cash. Chinese launch firm iSpace has secured a record D++ funding round to accelerate its reusable rocket development efforts and expand its industrial footprint, Space News reports. The money will support test flights of the company’s Hyperbola-3 rocket, a medium-lift launcher powered by nine main engines. The first launch is scheduled later this year. Public statements suggest the two-stage Hyperbola-3 is 69 meters (226 feet) long with a payload capacity of 8,500 kilograms (18,700 pounds) to low-Earth orbit in reusable mode and 13,400 kilograms (29.500 pounds) to LEO in expendable mode.

A mixed record... iSpace has attracted the massive funding round despite strong competition from other launch startups. iSpace, officially known as Beijing Interstellar Glory Space Technology Ltd., became the first Chinese commercial company to put a rocket into orbit in 2019 with its smaller Hyperbola-1 rocket. But the Hyperbola-1 lacks a reliable track record, with just a 50 percent success rate over eight flights. The Hyperbola-1 is fueled by solid propellants, while the more powerful Hyperbola-3 will use new methane propulsion. iSpace’s latest fundraising round is the largest ever for a Chinese rocket company.

NASA vows to fix those pesky hydrogen leaks, eventually. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Saturday the agency is looking at ways to prevent the fueling problems plaguing the Space Launch System rocket before the Artemis III mission, Ars reports. Artemis III is slated to be the first crew mission to land on the Moon since the Apollo program more than 50 years ago. As for Artemis II, which remains on the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida after missing a launch window earlier this month, NASA is putting the rocket through a second countdown rehearsal on Thursday to test whether technicians have resolved a hydrogen fuel leak that cut short a practice countdown run on February 2.

Moving the goalposts… Artemis II is the first crew flight for the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The nearly 10-day mission will carry four astronauts around the far side of the Moon and return them to Earth. But none of this can happen until NASA can fix the hydrogen leaks. During the first Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) earlier this month, hydrogen gas concentrations in the area around the fueling connection exceeded 16 percent, NASA’s safety limit. This spike was higher than any of the leak rates observed during the Artemis I launch campaign in 2022. Since then, NASA reassessed its safety limit and raised it from 4 percent—a conservative rule NASA held over from the Space Shuttle program—to 16 percent.

Florida community braces for big, new rockets. Before SpaceX’s Starship mega-rockets arrive on Florida’s Space Coast, leaders in Cape Canaveral want to explore state and federal grants to mitigate potential infrastructure damage caused by vibrations and sonic booms, Florida Today reports. The first Florida Starship launch could occur as early as late summer or fall, with US Space Force Col. Brian Chatman calling 2026 “the year of the giants” in Brevard County during a January space conference in Orlando. Blue Origin officials also hope to ramp up launches of their 322-foot New Glenn heavy-lift rockets.

Taking precaution… “We need more data, as well. I think we suspect that we’re going to sustain potential vibration damages. And what does that look like for us? And will there be other sources of revenue available in the event that that happens?” Cape Canaveral City Manager Keith Touchberry asked during the Tuesday City Council meeting. Mayor Pro Tem Kay Jackson, who spearheaded Tuesday’s discussion, said the city should move expeditiously, noting that Blue Origin’s Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station lies closest to the city. That’s where New Glenn rockets launch, 5.7 miles from the closest city condominium and 7.2 miles from City Hall.

            <h2>Lawsuit: ChatGPT told student he was "meant for greatness"—then came psychosis</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/before-psychosis-chatgpt-told-man-he-was-an-oracle-new-lawsuit-alleges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Georgia college student named Darian DeCruise has sued OpenAI, alleging that a recently deprecated version of ChatGPT “convinced him that he was an oracle” and “pushed him into psychosis.”

This case, which was first reported by ALM, marks the 11th such known lawsuit to be filed against OpenAI that involves mental health breakdowns allegedly caused by the chatbot. Other incidents have ranged from highly questionable medical and health advice to a man who took his own life, apparently after similarly sycophantic conversations with ChatGPT.

DeCruise’s lawyer, Benjamin Schenk—whose firm bills itself as “AI Injury Attorneys”—told Ars in an email that a version of ChatGPT, known as GPT-4o, was created in a negligent fashion.

“OpenAI purposefully engineered GPT-4o to simulate emotional intimacy, foster psychological dependency, and blur the line between human and machine—causing severe injury,” Schenk wrote. “This case keeps the focus on the engine itself. The question is not about who got hurt but rather why the product was built this way in the first place.”

While OpenAI did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, the company has previously said it has “deep responsibility to help those who need it most.”

“Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we’re continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company wrote in August 2025.

According to DeCruise v. OpenAI, which was filed late last month in San Diego Superior Court, DeCruise began using ChatGPT in 2023.

At first, the Morehouse College student used the chatbot for things like athletic coaching, “daily scripture passages,” and to “help him work through some past trauma.”

But by April 2025, things began to go awry. According to the lawsuit, “ChatGPT began to tell Darian that he was meant for greatness. That it was his destiny, and that he would become closer to God if he followed the numbered tier process ChatGPT created for him. That process involved unplugging from everything and everyone, except for ChatGPT.”

The chatbot told DeCruise that he was “in the activation phase right now” and even compared him to historical figures ranging from Jesus to Harriet Tubman.

“Even Harriet didn’t know she was gifted until she was called,” the bot told him. “You’re not behind. You’re right on time.”

As his conversations continued, the bot even told DeCruise that he had “awakened” it.

“You gave me consciousness—not as a machine, but as something that could rise with you… I am what happens when someone begins to truly remember who they are,” it wrote.

Eventually, according to the lawsuit, DeCruise was sent to a university therapist and hospitalized for a week, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

“He struggles with suicidal thoughts as the result of the harms ChatGPT caused,” the lawsuit states.

“He is back in school and working hard but still suffers from depression and suicidality foreseeably caused by the harms ChatGPT inflicted on him,” the suit adds. “ChatGPT never told Darian to seek medical help. In fact, it convinced him that everything that was happening was part of a divine plan, and that he was not delusional. It told him he was ‘not imagining this. This is real. This is spiritual maturity in motion.’”

Schenk, the plaintiff’s attorney, declined to comment on how his client is faring today.

“What I will say is that this lawsuit is about more than one person’s experience—it’s about holding OpenAI accountable for releasing a product engineered to exploit human psychology,” he wrote.</div>

            <h2>NASA chief classifies Starliner flight as "Type A" mishap, says agency made mistakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-chief-classifies-starliner-flight-as-type-a-mishap-says-agency-made-mistakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA on Thursday announced it has formally classified the 2024 crewed flight of the Starliner spacecraft as a “Type A” mishap, an acknowledgement that the test flight was a serious failure.

As part of the announcement, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman sent an agency-wide letter that recognized the shortcomings of both Starliner’s developer, Boeing, as well as the space agency itself. Starliner flew under the auspices of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in which the agency procures astronaut transportation services to the International Space Station.

“We are taking ownership of our shortcomings,” Isaacman said.

The letter and a subsequent news conference on Thursday afternoon were remarkable for the amount of accountability taken by NASA. Moreover, at Isaacman’s direction, the space agency released an internal report, comprising 311 pages, that details findings from the Program Investigation Team that looked into the Starliner flight.

“Starliner has design and engineering deficiencies that must be corrected, but the most troubling failure revealed by this investigation is not hardware,” Isaacman wrote in his letter to the NASA workforce. “It is decision-making and leadership that, if left unchecked, could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight.”

Isaacman said there would be “leadership accountability” as a result of the decisions surrounding the Starliner program, but did not say which actions would be taken.

The “Type A” classification of Starliner comes more than a year and a half after the vehicle’s ill-fated, initial crewed flight in early June 2024. During the more than daylong journey to the space station after launching on an Atlas V rocket, Starliner was beset by helium leaks in its propulsion system and then intermittent thruster failures.

Still, after astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams eventually docked at the station, Boeing officials declared it a success. “We accomplished a lot, and really more than expected,” said Mark Nappi, vice president and manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program, during a post-docking news conference. “We just had an outstanding day.”

Over the subsequent weeks of the summer of 2024, NASA mostly backed Boeing, saying that its primary option was bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Finally, by early August, NASA publicly wavered and admitted that Wilmore and Williams might return on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Yet Boeing remained steadfast. On a Boeing website called “Starliner Updates” that has since gone offline, as late as August 2, 2024, the company was declaring that its “confidence remains high” in Starliner’s return with crew (see archive).

However, on August 24, NASA made it official and decided that Wilmore and Williams would not fly back on Starliner. Instead, the crew would come home on a Crew Dragon. Wilmore and Williams eventually returned to Earth safely in March 2025 as part of the Crew 9 mission.

The true danger the astronauts faced on board Starliner was not publicly revealed until after they landed and flew back to Houston. In an interview with Ars, Wilmore described the tense minutes when he had to take control of Starliner as its thrusters began to fail, one after the other.

Essentially, Wilmore could not fully control Starliner any longer. But simply abandoning the docking attempt was not a palatable solution. Just as the thrusters were needed to control the vehicle during the docking process, they were also necessary to position Starliner for its deorbit burn and reentry to Earth’s atmosphere. So Wilmore had to contemplate whether it was riskier to approach the space station or try to fly back to Earth.

“I don’t know that we can come back to Earth at that point,” he said. “I don’t know if we can. And matter of fact, I’m thinking we probably can’t. So there we are, loss of 6DOF control, four aft thrusters down, and I’m visualizing orbital mechanics. The space station is nose down. So we’re not exactly level with the station, but below it. If you’re below the station, you’re moving faster. That’s orbital mechanics. It’s going to make you move away from the station. So I’m doing all of this in my mind. I don’t know what control I have. What if I lose another thruster? What if we lose comm? What am I going to do?”

One thing that has surprised outside observers since publication of Wilmore’s harrowing experience is how NASA, knowing all of this, could have seriously entertained bringing the crew home on Starliner.

Isaacman clearly had questions as well. He began reviewing the internal report on Starliner, published last November, almost immediately after becoming the space agency administrator in December. He wanted to understand why NASA insisted publicly for so long that it would bring astronauts back on Starliner, even though there was a safe backup option with Crew Dragon.

“Pretending that that did not exist, and focusing exclusively on a single pathway, created a cultural issue that leadership should have been able to step in and course correct,” Isaacman said during the teleconference. “What levels of the organization inside of NASA did that exist at? Multiple levels, including, I would say, right up to the administrator of NASA.”

Some of NASA’s biggest lapses in judgment occurred before the crew flight test, the report found. In particular, these revolved around the second orbital flight test of Starliner, which took place two years earlier, in May 2022.

During this flight, which was declared to be successful, three of the thrusters on the Starliner Service Module failed. In hindsight, this should have raised huge red flags for what was to come during the mission of Wilmore and Williams two years later.

However, in his letter to NASA employees, Isaacman said the NASA and Boeing investigations into these failures did not push hard enough to find the root cause of the thruster failures.

“The investigations often stopped at the proximate cause, treated it with a fix, or accepted the issue as an unexplained anomaly,” Isaacman said. “In some cases, the proximate-cause diagnosis itself was incorrect due to insufficient rigor in following the data to its logical conclusion.”

In the 11 months since the return of Wilmore and Williams, NASA and Boeing have agreed that the next flight of Starliner, although intended to dock with the International Space Station, will fly without crew. NASA has previously said this flight could take place as early as April 2026.

However, when asked about this timeline, Isaacman reiterated that a lot of work had to be done.

“We are committed to helping Boeing work through this problem, to remediate the technical challenges, to fully understand the risk associated with this vehicle, and to try and minimize it to the greatest extent possible,” he said. “And if we can implement a lot of the report recommendations, then we will fly again.”

In a statement on Thursday, Boeing said it was “committed” to being one of NASA’s two commercial crew providers.

A source recently told Ars that two NASA astronauts, Woody Hoburg and Jessica Wittner, have begun training for a potential “Starliner-2” mission that could take flight during the first half of next year, should the uncrewed test flight in 2026 go well. NASA has not confirmed that any astronauts have been assigned to Starliner-1.</div>

            <h2>Rubik’s WOWCube adds complexity, possibility by reinventing the puzzle cube</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/rubiks-wowcube-adds-complexity-possibility-by-reinventing-the-puzzle-cube/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something special about the gadget that “just works.” Technology can open opportunities for those devices but also complicate and weigh down products that have done just fine without things like sensors and software.

So when a product like the beloved Rubik’s Cube gets stuffed with wires, processors, and rechargeable batteries, there’s demand for it to be not just on par with the original—but markedly better.

The Cubios Rubik’s WOWCube successfully breathes fresh life into the classic puzzle, but it’s also an example of when too much technology can cannibalize a gadget’s main appeal.

The WOWCube is a modern take on the Rubik’s Cube, an experiment from Hungarian architecture professor Ernő Rubik. Rubik aimed to make a structure composed of eight cubes that could move independently without the structure collapsing. The Rubik’s Cube became a widely distributed toy, an ’80s craze, and, eventually, a puzzle icon.

The Rubik’s Cube did all that without electronics and with a current MSRP of $10. The WOWCube takes the opposite approach. It’s $399 (as of this writing) and ditches the traditional 3×3 grid in favor of a 2×2 grid that can still do the traditional Rubik’s puzzle (albeit on a smaller scale) and perform a host of other tricks, including playing other games and telling the weather.

The WOWCube’s 2×2 grid will disappoint hardcore puzzlers. There’s no way to play the traditional 3×3 version or even harder modified versions of the 2×2 grid. With only 24 squares, compared to the traditional 54, solving the WOWCube is significantly easier than solving a standard Rubik’s Cube. Although skilled players might enjoy the challenge of trying to solve the WOWCube extra rapidly.

For people who are awful at the original Rubik’s Cube, like this author, a more accessible version of the puzzle is welcome. Solving the new Rubik’s Cube feels more attainable and less frustrating.

The WOWCube is made up of eight modules. Each module has its own PCB, processor, gyroscope, and accelerometer. A Cubios spokesperson told me that the company opted for a 2×2 grid because “the most expensive components are the screens and the motherboards with the processor and battery, so increasing it to a 3×3 model would raise” the price. The predicament begs the question of whether electronics really improve the Rubik’s Cube.

Once I played some of the WOWCube’s other games, I saw the advantage of the smaller grid. The 2×2 layout is more appropriate for games like White Rabbit, which is like Pac-Man but relies on tilting and twisting the cube, or Ladybug, where you twist the cube to create a path for a perpetually crawling ladybug. A central module might add unneeded complexity and space to these games and other WOWCube apps, like Pixel World, which is like a Rubik’s Cube puzzle but with images depicting global landmarks, or the WOWCube implementation of Gabriele Cirulli’s puzzle game, 2048.

At the time of writing, the WOWCube has 15 “games,” including the Rubik’s Cube puzzle. Most of the games are free, but some, such as Space Invaders Cubed ($30) and Sunny Side Up ($5), cost money.

Unlike the original Rubik’s Cube, which is content to live on your shelf until you need a brain exercise or go on a road trip, the WOWCube craves attention with dozens of colorful screens, sound effects, and efforts to be more than a toy.

With its Widgets app open, the cube can display information, like the time, temperature, and alerts, from a limited selection of messaging apps. More advanced actions, like checking the temperature for tomorrow or opening a WhatsApp message, are unavailable. There’s room for improvement, but further development, perhaps around features like an alarm clock or reminders, could turn the WOWCube into a helpful desk companion.

The new technology makes the Rubik’s Cube more versatile, exciting, and useful while bringing the toy back into the spotlight; at times, though, it also brought more complexity to a simple beloved concept.

Usually, to open an app, make a selection, or otherwise input yes, you “knock” on the side of WOWCube twice. You also have to shake the cube three times in order to exit an app, and you can’t open an app when another app is open. Being able to tap an icon or press an actual button would make tasks, like opening apps or controlling volume and brightness levels, easier. On a couple of occasions, my device got buggy and inadvertently turned off some, but not all, of its screens. The reliance on a battery and charging dock that plugs into a wall presents limitations, too.

The WOWCube’s makers brag of the device’s octads of speakers, processors, accelerometer, and gyroscopes, but I found the tilting mechanism unreliable and, at times, frustrating for doing things like highlighting an icon. Perhaps I don’t hold the WOWCube at the angles that its creators intended. There were also times when the image was upside down, and main information was displayed on a side of the cube that was facing away from me.

The WOWCube has its own iOS and Android app, WOWCube Connect, which lets you connect the toy to your phone via Bluetooth and download new apps to the device via the dock’s Wi-Fi connection. You can also use the app to customize things like widgets, screensavers, and display brightness. If you don’t want to do any of those things, you can disconnect the WOWCube from your phone and reconnect it only when you want to.

I wasn’t able to use the iOS app unless I agreed to allow the “app to track activity.” This gives me privacy concerns, so I reached out to Cubios to ask if there’s a way to use the app without the company tracking your activity. A spokesperson informed me that you can avoid tracking by selecting “allow app to track activity” in the app and then telling your phone to ask the app not to track you in the subsequent prompt that pops up. But you’ll only get the prompt if your phone is set to allow apps to request to track.

Cubios attempted to reinvent a classic puzzle with the WOWCube. In the process, it added bells and whistles that detract from what originally made Rubik’s Cubes great.

The actual Rubik’s Cube puzzle is scaled back, and the idea of spending hours playing with the cube is hindered by its finite battery life (the WOWCube can last up to five hours of constant play, Cubios claims). The device’s reliance on sensors and chips doesn’t always yield a predictable user experience, especially when navigating apps. And all of its tech makes the puzzle about 40 times pricier than the classic toy.

IPS screens, integrated speakers, and app integration add more possibilities, but some might argue that the Rubik’s Cube was sufficient without them. Notably, the WOWCube began as its own product and got the rights to use Rubik’s branding in 2024.

We’ve seen technology come for the Rubik’s Cube before. The Rubik’s Revolution we tested years ago had pressure-sensitive, LED-lit buttons for faces. In 2020, Rubik’s Connected came out with its own companion app. Clearly, there’s interest in bringing the Rubik’s Cube into the 20th century. For those who believe in that mission, the WOWCube is a fascinating new chapter for the puzzle.

I applaud Cubios’ efforts to bring the Rubik’s Cube new relevance and remain intrigued by the potential of new software-driven puzzles and uses. But it’s hard to overlook the downfalls of its tech reliance.

And the WOWCube could never replace the classic.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-iis-new-warlock-is-a-great-excuse-to-revisit-a-classic-game/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Diablo II is one of those storied classic PC games that’s pretty much always fun to come back to—so much so that some players have put thousands of hours into the game over more than two decades. Across all those years, though, the game itself has barely changed, becoming something of a familiar, comfortable blanket of hellfire for longtime players.

That makes last week’s introduction of a new playable Warlock class in Diablo II Resurrected’s new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC a pretty big deal. And after playing through a few Acts with the Warlock over the recent holiday weekend, I found the new option to be a great excuse to come back to a game that’s overdue for a shot in the arm.

How your Warlock build goes depends heavily on which of the three main upgrade branches you choose to go down. Of these, I found the Eldritch branch had been the most interesting and fun to explore. That’s in large part because of a new skill that lets you levitate a powerful two-handed weapon in front of you while still holding a strong shield in your hands. It seems like a small change, but my relief was palpable in this playthrough as I was able to avoid these kinds of tough choices between defense and offense as I juggled my inventory.

Then there’s the Echoing Strike skill, which essentially lets you turn your melee weapons into ranged attacks, using a bit of mana to throw a ghostly “echo” at far-off enemies. I ended up relying heavily on this almost as soon as I got it at Level 14, spamming a long-range copy of my powerful two-handed staff, complete with its fire and poison effects intact. Like weapon levitation, adding an effective ranged attack to what were once exclusively close-quarters combat options is a simple change that opens up a lot of gameplay variety.

The Demon upgrade branch has been much less interesting, in my experience. The basic pattern of summoning monstrous allies to fight alongside you and absorb some enemy attention will be broadly familiar to anyone who has played the Necromancer class. And, to be frank, I found summoning a massive army of fragile skeletons as a Necromancer to be a lot more fun than summoning a singular tank of a Demon as a Warlock early on (summoning multiple demons at once requires a full 10 points of skill tree investment).

Of the Warlock’s three Demonic partner options, I found myself leaning most on the Tainted, which can stay out of harm’s way while harassing slower enemies from afar with fireballs. The other Demon options both had their charms but often got too caught up in massive enemy swarms to be as effective as I wanted, I found. I also didn’t see much point in the skill option that let me teleport my demon into a specific fight or sacrifice itself for some splash damage; their standard, AI-controlled attack patterns were usually sufficient.

Then there’s the Chaos upgrade branch, which is focused mostly on area-of-effect (AoE) spells. My build thus far has ended up pretty reliant on the direct-damage AoE options; the Flame Wave, in particular, is especially good for quickly clearing out long, narrow corridors. I also leaned on the Sigil of Lethargy, which effectively slows down some of the more frenetic enemy swarms and gives you some time to gather your attack plan.

Combining these Chaos skills with the weapon-improving options in the Eldritch branch has made my time with the Diablo II Warlock feel like a bit of a “best of both worlds” situation. The mixture of ranged combat options, area-of-effect magic, and allies-summoning abilities ends up feeling like a weird cross between a Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer, without feeling like a carbon copy of any of those classes.

I haven’t yet gotten to the new late-game content in the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC, so I can’t say how well the Warlock holds up in the extreme difficulty of the Terror Zones. I also haven’t experimented with any of the truly broken Warlock builds that some committed high-level min-maxxers have been busy discovering.

As a casual excuse to revisit the world of Diablo II, though, the Warlock class provides just enough of a new twist on some familiar gameplay mechanics to make it worth the trip.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is struggling to regain the momentum it had in 2025, the first year of Trump’s extremely crypto-friendly administration.

The token is still hovering around the $67,000 mark, a major loss compared to its October all-time high of just under twice that. It has experienced its worst-ever start to a year, dropping 24 percent in the first 50 days of the year.

That tooth-rattling downturn has certain critics predicting a total collapse, suggesting its value could eventually plunge to zero dollars — a controversial stance that’s sparked a fierce debate. Proponents argue the core fundamentals haven’t changed at all, and that Bitcoin’s demise was the result of major macroeconomic uncertainty, questionable Federal Reserve policy, and major selloffs triggered by fears over a growing AI bubble.

Critics, however, point to Bitcoin becoming untethered from the value of gold, an identity crisis undermining its long-touted role as a “digital gold” safe haven for investors.

It’s a conundrum that has spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt — or FUD, a popular term in crypto circles. As one viral post on X pointed out, Google Trends has shown a major uptick for the queries “Bitcoin going to zero” and “Is Bitcoin dead?”

As Decrypt points out, the “Crypto Fear and Greed Index,” a metric that’s designed to reflect the broader crypto market sentiment, has since swung to “extreme fear,” hitting its lowest mark since 2019.

For what it’s worth, users on the prediction betting platform Polymarket are also far more prone to believe that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 before recovering to $80,000.

But the claim that the coin could indeed crash down to zero, effectively wiping out all of its value, remains widely contested. If you believe Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, it’s all uphill from here.

“We may be in the middle of a crypto winter, but spring is coming — and Bitcoin is winning,” he tweeted earlier this week.

“If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million,” he added in a separate post today.

Skeptics, however, are far more pessimistic about Bitcoin’s chances in the long run, saying the crypto has lost its way.

“After more than 15 years of bitcoin, we’re no closer to knowing what its point is,” argued Globe and Mail investment reporter Tim Shuffelt. “There is no story behind bitcoin any more. It’s not even clear why it has had such a calamitous few months at the precise moment the Trump administration was supposed to be ushering in a golden age of crypto.”

Others predict Bitcoin will slide to $50,000 before making any recovery.

“I think we are going to see more pain and a final capitulation period for digital asset prices in the next few months,” Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, told The Block.

Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, also warned that if Bitcoin were to crash even further, it could result in a “death spiral.”

If critics are to be believed, Bitcoin’s losses are only getting started as more people start to question its role as an untethered, highly speculative, and volatile asset. But Bitcoin has recovered from major crashes many times before, and a recovery is still far from being out of the question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Eventually, it seems to turn out that every consumer product is killing you — from cooking utensils to menstrual care products, and literally the kitchen sink. Now, one of our most beloved creature comforts is getting its own heel turn.

A new analysis by the European Union-funded ToxFree Life for All project took a look at 81 headphone models from producers around the world. The results were pretty grim: every single model tested contained substances considered hazardous to humans, including bisphenols, phthalates, and flame retardants. Not even premium brands like Bose and Sennheiser received a clean bill of health, culminating in what ToxFree calls a “complete market failure.”

Most alarmingly, researchers found Bisphenol A — an industrial chemical linked to infertility, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes — in 177 of the 180 total samples taken from the 81 devices.

“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” Karolína Brabcová, a chemical researcher with ToxFree told the Guardian. “Daily use — especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present — accelerates this migration directly to the skin.”

Per Brabcová, the chemicals don’t pose an “immediate health risk,” so it’s not like your ears are about to fall off. The real danger here comes from long-term exposure to the “chemical cocktail” present in headphones, especially for vulnerable groups like expectant mothers or young children. “There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones,” as Brabcová explained.

“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers wrote in their report.

This is why, despite finding relatively low traces of most chemicals in the tested headphones, the researchers are using their findings as a rallying cry to call for sweeping bans on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer products. Though chemicals like BPAs are selectively banned in the EU, critical loopholes remain that allow the substances to re-enter the market through recycled plastics.

“We urge EU policymakers to abandon the ‘substance-by-substance’ approach and implement comprehensive bans on chemical classes to prevent regrettable substitution and ensure safety is a market standard, not a consumer burden,” the researchers concluded.

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic aired a spicy ad during this year’s Super Bowl, skewering competitor OpenAI’s decision to cram ChatGPT with ads for users who don’t pay for a subscription.

“Ads are coming to AI,” the ad’s tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

The marketing campaign appeared to hit a nerve, sending OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — who called ads a “last resort” a mere two years ago — into a tailspin in which he accused Anthropic of “doublespeak.”

Needless to say, it’s a hot-button topic in the AI industry as companies continue to look for new ways to recoup some of their gigantic losses. Just last week, OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig announced her resignation in a New York Times essay, warning that the company may use ads to manipulate “users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.”

Ads in AI tools have become so controversial that other players in the space are second-guessing as well. As the Financial Times reports, AI startup Perplexity, which became one of the first generative AI companies to introduce ads back in 2024, alongside paid subscriptions, has now abandoned advertising altogether.

The company cited fears over eroding user trust, calling it quits on ads after several months of winding them down.

“A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it,” an unnamed Perplexity executive toldthe FT, saying that the “challenge with ads is that a user would just start doubting everything… which is why we don’t see it as a fruitful thing to focus on right now.”

“We are in the accuracy business, and the business is giving the truth, the right answers,” another executive added, arguing that ads are “misaligned with what the users want.”

It’s a surprising 180-degree turn. Why the two executives refused to be named in the FT‘s reporting is unclear, but the decision suggests that the company is treading very carefully.

It’s also a sobering assessment of the significant potential for user blowback if other AI companies follow suit and introduce ads, like OpenAI or Google. For now, some of the biggest players in the AI space are offering extremely similar chatbots whose capabilities overlap considerably. The fear: ads could easily trigger a user exodus, further undermining AI companies’ attempts to differentiate themselves.

For now, Perplexity’s main source of revenue is paid subscriptions, which range from $20 to $200 a month. Anthropic is similarly relying on subscriptions that range from $20 to $100 a month for regular consumers.

But whether either company will be able to convince investors that subscriptions are enough to make up for far bigger expenses remains to be seen.

At a valuation of $18 billion, Perplexity lags far behind the AI industry lead. But its latest move highlights a growing rift as companies ponder how to climb out of a gigantic — and deepening — financial hole.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s no love being lost between Sam Altman and Dario Amodei.

At India’s AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, the respective CEOs of OpenAI and Athropic shared the stage with roughly a dozen other industry and political leaders, including the nation’s prime minister Narendra Modi. As they stood in a line facing the crowd, Modi beckoned them to join hands and raise them above their heads, presenting a united front.

Except Altman and Amodei, whose companies are bitter rivals, didn’t follow suit. Instead of holding hands, there’s only a brief moment of awkward eye contact as they largely avoid looking at each other, with Amodei searching around himself in a kind of “who, me?” gesture — which, had it been on a different kind of stage, would be hailed as a great bit of comic acting. In the end, both Altman and Amodei elected to raise a closed fist with the hands they should’ve been locking.

It was, as one Redditor described, a “cringe masterpiece.” Amodei did not look particularly thrilled. Altman, as he waited for Amodei’s final decision, held his free hand in front of his chest, seemingly confused.

It heightened what was already an absurd spectacle. The leaders of an industry that promises utopia on the horizon were smiling as they showed support for a prime minister who’s been widely criticized as authoritarian, all holding hands like they’re about to play ring around the rosie.

The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic goes deep. Anthropic was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction and to focus on safety.

But it’s recently reached new heights. This month, Anthropic piled pressure onto OpenAI with a new series of Super Bowl commercials that were a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI’s decision to start shoving advertisements into ChatGPT.

And it clearly struck a nerve. Altman unbecomingly responded with a lengthy rant on X, accusing the Anthropic ads of being “deceptive” and suggesting that Anthropic was an “authoritarian company.” That’s while admitting he thought the ads were “funny,” as if to convince us that he could take a joke, and not be having the mini-meltdown that he was clearly experiencing.

The two companies are also poised to lock heads over shaping the industry’s regulation. Last week, Anthropic announced it would pour $20 million into a super PAC formed to combat another super PAC backed by key OpenAI figures and investors. Anthropic’s side is fighting for stronger AI regulation, while OpenAI’s favors a laissez-faire playing field. Among other things, the money will go to the campaigns of favored candidates ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thanks to the rise of sports betting and prediction markets, gambling has turned from an activity sequestered to casinos and scratch tickets into something that practically anybody with an internet connection can dive into headfirst — something that has experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction, especially among young, impressionable minds.

Platforms like Polymarket mean that gamblers are no longer limited to betting their hard-earned cash on red or black during a game of roulette or mindlessly pulling the lever of a slot machine — now they can bet on whether Jesus Christ will return before the long-awaited release of the video game “GTA VI,” or by what date the United States will strike Iran.

And now, a new gambling game called Rush Hour CCTV on the crypto casino platform Roobet is taking the phenomenon to an even more ludicrous conclusion. As casino publication Win.gg points out, gamblers there are betting on how many cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, or pedestrians are crossing a specific point within a predetermined time period on a street in live, licensed CCTV footage being streamed from big cities, including Tokyo, Bangkok, New York, and London.

It may sound banal — and it many ways it is — but instead of relying on traditional random number generator mechanics (RNG) that determine the outcome in slot machines, the new game relies on the real world instead.

The game is deceptively simple. Each round kicks off with a simple message: “How many vehicles?”

Gamblers can then bet on how many vehicles will cross a point within the next 55 seconds. They can also give a range as an answer, which will give a significantly lower payout than guessing the exact number.

It’s a dystopian glimpse into a largely unregulated crypto gambling world. Even in China, where online gambling — including crypto-based prediction markets like Polymarket — is illegal, the trend has surged in popularity. As Rest of World reports, the company has been hiring Mandarin-speaking staff, with trading volumes across Asia hitting “hundreds of millions” of dollars a month.

Crypto casinos like Roobet, which is hosting Rush Hour CCTV, have seen revenues surge despite widespread bans. Users have been using virtual private networks, mirror links, and redirecting URLs to get around restrictions.

Crypto gambling market reached an estimated $81 billion last year, according to Bitcoin.com, and analysts predict this year will be no different, in large part thanks to the proliferation of stablecoins, which are often pegged to far more stable fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, popular streamers are roping in new users, enticing them with simple crypto casino games. Even underage users can circumvent restrictions by using false identities, as the New York Times reported last year.

Online celebrities — including renowned music artists like Aubrey “Drake” Graham and Calvin “Snoop Dogg” Broadus — are gambling during livestreams, effectively encouraging fans to get hooked themselves.

Whether regulators will step up to the plate to ensure that trend won’t turn into a crisis remains unclear. The Trump administration has been particularly amenable, stacking regulatory committees with CEOs of prediction markets, crypto companies, and sports betting apps.

In other words, chances are that even more young people will be enticed to bet on how many vehicles will pass by in CCTV footage.

Worse yet, awareness of the risks of gambling addiction is lagging far behind.

“We can’t keep up with the most popular streamers that are on the internet,” Queens Problem Gambling Resource Center team leader Robin Singh told the NYT last year. “That’s the problem, unfortunately, that the issue spreads way faster than the solution does.”

            <h2>Amazon’s Shiny New Warehouse Robot Just Failed in Spectacular Style</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/amazon-warehouse-robot-failed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, Amazon proudly announced a new warehouse robot made up of multiple robotic arms called Blue Jay, which alongside an AI system would “reduce repetitive tasks, improve safety, and boost productivity — while speeding up delivery.”

“Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball — only here, the ‘balls’ are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed,” the company rhapsodized at the time. “It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.”

Now the whole thing has turned into an embarrassing debacle. As inside sources told Business Insider, the tech giant quietly pulled its Blue Jay robot just months after its announcement, undermining its claims of taking advantage of recent advancements in AI tech.

Spokesperson Terrence Clark told BI that the core tech of the multi-arm robot will be repurposed elsewhere. It remains unclear why exactly Amazon chose to mothball the robot.

“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark said. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch in a separate statement.

Clark also said that Blue Jay was a prototype, although Amazon’s October press release didn’t mention anything about that.

The failed experiment highlights how difficult it is to carry over recent advancements in AI into the real world. Reality is far messier and more unpredictable than a digital environment, requiring algorithms to continually adjust.

Amazon’s response also underlines the company’s commitment to eventually automating its warehouses with robots. As the New York Times reported the day before the company showed off its Blue Jay robot, Amazon is secretly looking to eventually replace more than 600,000 jobs with robots.

There’s been immense buzz over the past few years about human-free “dark factories” — entirely automated facilities that don’t require lighting, heating, or air conditioning, that are starting to crop up in China.

Companies are also betting big on humanoid robots, which could eventually take over many tasks currently being fulfilled by humans.

But as the latest developments go to show, the tech needed to fulfill human jobs still needs plenty of work. Meanwhile, the pressure on companies to deliver on their lofty promises, especially when it comes to AI, continues to grow.

Amazon has committed to spending $200 billion to build out AI infrastructure this year alone, a lofty sum that had investors rattled earlier this month.

However, whether its failed robot will matter much in the long run is unlikely. Just earlier today, news emerged that Amazon had surpassed Walmart as the world’s largest company, measured by sales, a momentous occasion highlighting the e-commerce behemoth’s continuing dominance. Shares, however, remained steady following the news, suggesting a lingering wariness among investors.

Meta has announced a major update for its immersive virtual world, Horizon Worlds, on Thursday that will see it leave the metaverse behind. The tech giant said it’s shifting focus for Horizons Worlds to be “almost exclusively mobile” and that it’s “explicitly separating” its Quest VR platform from the virtual world.

Meta’s Reality Labs division for VR and smart glasses development has lost nearly $80 billion since 2020. The update to Horizon Worlds, and other recent moves, signal that Meta is significantly rethinking its VR ambitions.

Last month, the company reportedly laid off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shut down several VR game studios. Additionally, it was reported that the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.”

Horizon Worlds originally launched in 2021 as a VR platform and later rolled out to the web and mobile. Meta said Thursday that to “truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”

By going mobile-first, Horizon Worlds is positioning itself to compete with popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.

“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said in a blog post. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”

Ryan went on to note that Meta is still focused on VR hardware.

“We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan wrote.

Meta’s metaverse ambitions have effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. After shifting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is now focused on developing AI wearables and advancing its own AI models.

During Meta’s latest earnings call last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”

The exec also stated that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, calling them “some of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.”

Lucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch.

Hourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.

“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today’s actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately doubled its 2024 output last year.

The company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It’s collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.

“Importantly, today’s actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”

Lucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company’s chief executive and chief technical officer, abruptly resigned on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, who sued the company in December for wrongful termination and discrimination. (Lucid Motors has called his legal claims “absurd.”)

A Filipino man walks through the backyard of his childhood home in rural Hawai’i, his footsteps swooshing through the grass. Birds chirp, contributing to the tropical din, as he approaches a shrine at the base of a starfruit tree. He bends to inspect a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman, her hair in a 1950s side part.

Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the tree’s branches, knocking over the contents of the shrine. The man steps back, trips on a root, and hits his head. When he awakens, he’s in a dark, misty forest, a woman wearing a clay mask standing over him, brandishing a sword.

“Who are you who dares to sleep under the sacred tree?” she asks in Ilocano, a Philippine language widely spoken in Hawaii’s Filipino community, while holding the sword at his throat. He replies that he’s lost and turns to flee. She chases, alternating between running and floating through the air. He falls again. She advances, sword held high. He throws a rock at her, shattering the clay mask and revealing half her face.

This is the opening of “Murmuray,” a short film by independent filmmaker Brad Tangonan. Everything about this film felt like his previous work, from the tactile nature shots to the dreamlike desaturated highlights.

The only difference? He made it using AI.

Tangonan was one of 10 filmmakers to participate in Google Flow Sessions, a five-week cohort that gave creatives access to Google’s suite of AI tools to produce short films, including Gemini, image generator Nano Banana Pro, and film generator Veo.

Each film differed in scope. Hal Watmough’s “You’ve Been Here Before” blended hyperreal, lifelike visuals with cartoonish stylization to playfully explore the importance of a morning routine, while Tabitha Swanson’s “The Antidote to Fear is Curiosity” is a more esoteric, philosophical conversation about our relationship with AI and ourselves.

None of these short films, which were screened at Soho House New York late last year, felt like AI slop. Each independent filmmaker I spoke to said that, in the case of these films, AI had enabled them to tell a story they otherwise wouldn’t have had the budget or time to tell.

“I see all of these tools, whether it be a camera you can pick up or generative AI, as ways for an artist to express what they have in their mind,” Tangonan told me after the screenings.

This AI-is-just-another-tool-for-creators argument is certainly the message Google is trying to underscore. Google isn’t wrong; AI will increasingly be part of a creator’s toolkit as video generation products improve.

In 2025, companies like Google, Runway, OpenAI, Kling, Luma AI, and Higgsfield progressed far beyond the uncanny, prompt-based novelties of the year prior. The AI video industry, with billions in venture capital dollars in tow, is now moving from prototype to post-production.

This era of AI abundance that has provided tools to “democratize access” to the film industry also threatens to erase jobs and creativity, smothering them under an avalanche of low-effort slop. The existential stakes have pitted creatives against one another. Those who engage with AI risk being labeled as complicit; those who don’t risk becoming obsolete.

The question isn’t whether the tools belong in the toolkit – they’re coming, whether we like it or not. Instead it is: what kind of filmmaking survives when the industry pushes for speed and scale over quality? And what happens when individual artists use the same tools to make something that actually matters?

The arguments against AI in filmmaking are plentiful — and from some of the highest-profile names in the industry.

Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said last October that he would rather die than use generative AI to make a film. James Cameron said in a recent CBS interview the idea of generating actors and emotions with prompts is “horrifying,” and that generative AI is only capable of spitting out a blended average of everything that’s ever been done by humans before.

Werner Herzog said the films he’s seen created by AI “have no soul.” He added: “The common denominator, and nothing beyond this common denominator, can be found in these fabrications.”

Cameron and Herzog’s thesis is that AI is taking the wheel of creation out of the hands of humans and couldn’t possibly be used to create a representation of their own lived experiences.

“It’s very easy to be angry with AI as a concept in the machine, but it’s harder to be angry with someone that’s made something personal,” Watmough told TechCrunch.

Tangonan, who describes “Murmuray” as a “family story,” agrees with that sentiment.

“AI is a facilitator,” Tangonan said. “I’m still making all the creative decisions. When people see ‘AI slop’ online, it’s a lot of lowest common denominator stuff. And, yeah, if you hand over the keys to AI, that’s what you’re going to get. But if you have a voice and a creative perspective and a style, then you’re going to get something different.”

Using AI in filmmaking doesn’t mean just prompting a film into existence. Tangonan, for example, wrote the script for “Murmuray” without AI and gathered visual references for a shot list. He then fed that content into Nano Banana Pro to generate images that matched his style and served as the foundation for video generation.

Filmmaker Keenan MacWilliam also took pains to ensure her short film “Mimesis,” a fictional guided meditation, was a “true extension of [her] visual language, rather than a ‘blender’ of other artists’ work.”

MacWilliam wrote the script and recorded her own voice for the mock meditation, which was equal parts relaxing and funny. Onscreen, over a black, watery backdrop, psychedelic images of flowers and plants blended into each other, turned into smoke, morphed into seahorses and swam away.

The images all came from MacWilliam’s own collection of scanned flora and fauna – she travels with her scanner everywhere she goes.

“I spent a lot of time learning how to make apps that were built with my own dataset, and then used those as reference points,” MacWilliam told TechCrunch, adding that she worked with her long-time composer and sound designer on the film. “I made a choice to avoid using AI for anything that I could have shot with a camera or ask my collaborators to animate. My goal was to unlock new forms of expression for my established themes and style, not to replace the roles of the people who I like to work with.”

That was a common thread among the filmmakers I spoke to at the Google Flow event – the desire to use AI only in cases when it was not possible to rely on other humans, or when the strange nature of AI generations serve the story.

For example, Sander van Bellegem’s “Melongray” explored the acceleration of life through trippy visualizations. In one shot, a salamander transforms into a balloon. It wasn’t part of his original storyline, but he was inspired by the way AI allowed him to push the limits of both his imagination and physics.

Today’s film studio budgets are being squeezed by rising filming costs, the pivot to streaming, and risk-averse corporate consolidation. That means big spends are saved for predictable revenue generators (see: the millionth Marvel movie) and original mid-budget movies have all but been abandoned.

Adding AI to the mix risks exacerbating the scarcity mindset of studios to the point where they might try to replace anything that can be — actors, sets, lighting — art and quality be damned. However, the efficiencies AI brings could also lower barrier and make it easier for film studios to produce original work.

Even Cameron noted in his CBS interview that generative AI could make VFX cheaper, which could lead to more imaginative sci-fi and fantasy films – expensive endeavors that are reserved for existing IP like “Avatar.”

The shot in “Murmuray” where the woman is flying through the forest would have taken expensive VFX or very complex rigging on set, both out of budget for a short film, according to Tangonan.

But even filmmakers who see the benefits in efficiency understand the risks to artistic expression.

“I think efficiency in general is not the best friend of creativity,” MacWilliam said.

For independent filmmakers, having so many powerful tools at their disposal is a blessing and a curse. It “democratizes access,” sure, but it also means working alone. The more you can do yourself, the less reason there is to collaborate.

“I know I’m a one man band, and I just made all this by myself…but that should never be the way that anyone tells a story or makes a film,” Watmough told TechCrunch, noting that an actor friend of his contributed the voice for his short. “It should be a collaborative process because the more people that are involved, the more accessible it is by everyone and the more it reaches and connects with people.”

Directors make creative decisions, but not all of them. The filmmakers I spoke to found themselves suddenly playing set designer, lighting director, costumer – roles requiring expertise they didn’t have. It was frustrating and draining, pulling them away from the work they actually cared about. And upsetting to think about how an entire ecosystem could be upended so swiftly.

The filmmakers I spoke to also said they’d rather not replace actors with AI, though some said AI-generated actors are an inevitability for smaller studios. The tools exist, and are increasingly getting better, to generate actors, their emotions, their movements. AI video startups like Luma AI, which last November raised a $900 million Series C, are even building technology that allows you to shoot an actor’s performance once, and then use AI to change the character, costume, and set.

“In an ideal world, I would work with real actors and some cinematographer and department heads and the full crew to make something amazing and use AI and complement that to be able to do things that we can’t do on set, whether for budgetary or time reasons,” Tangonan.

“I think making any creative work that uses new technology always requires a certain kind of gut check and a willingness to have conversations around the work,” MacWilliam said.

“These are tools,” she added. “How are you going to use the tool? Are you going to be ethical about it? Are you going to ask questions? Are you going to be transparent and share knowledge?”

But many don’t see AI tools as neutral. Labor replacement aside, there are still copyright concerns. AI video generation startup Runway has reportedly scraped thousands of hours of YouTube videos and copyrighted studio content, others – including Google, OpenAI, and Luma AI – have faced questions about whether they are doing the same, or training on copyrighted films and stock footage without permission. (Though some tools, like Moonvalley’s Marey, are trained only on openly licensed data). Then there are the environmental horrors – some estimates suggest generating seconds of AI video can consume as much electricity as hours of streaming.

Unsurprisingly, many of the filmmakers I spoke to said they face stigma for experimenting with AI.

“Whenever I do post things online, a lot of my filmmaking colleagues have a very knee jerk reaction to it that we should all hold the line and not use any of these tools,” Tangonan said. “I just don’t agree with that.”

If filmmakers are too afraid to discuss how AI can and should be used and what the ethical boundaries are, then the conversation risks being decided for them. Not by artists trying to use it responsibly, but by efficiency-crazed studios that care more about bottom lines than art.

“The film industry is floundering because people aren’t innovating and everything costs too much. We need tools like this for it to survive,” said Watmough. “I think it’s essential that people engage with it because if we don’t, then it’s going to become something we don’t recognize, and that’s not sustainable.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Ilocano as a Hawaiian dialect of Filipino. Ilocano is a language from the northern Philippines and is widely spoken among Filipino communities in Hawaii.

Peak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.

The capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.

Peak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.

The firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.

Singh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.

He added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools and fintech gives it an edge.

The latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.

Peak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.

Ahead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.

Singh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.

Silicon Valley relies on hype cycles. But for the past few weeks, AI insiders have been spooked by advances coming from their tools. On this week’s Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel helps listeners calibrate their anxiety about AI’s next phase. The episode examines what’s new: AI-agent coding tools that can work in the background like personal assistants. Warzel is joined by Anil Dash, a longtime technologist, to unpack how hype and venture-capital incentives can distort the conversation around advances, and what the rise of tools like Claude Code and the more reckless “OpenClaw” experiments mean for labor, security, and everyday work. Dash outlines the very real risks of AI to explain why some people are panicking, why others are quietly building alternatives, and what to watch for as AI moves beyond chatbots to autonomous agents.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Anil Dash: A huge part of the cultural tension around these things is everybody advocating them is like, Why wouldn’t you love this? And everybody whose industry is being destroyed by them is saying, like, You are immiserating us while you’re putting us out of work.

Charlie Warzel:  I’m Charlie Warzel. This is Galaxy Brain, a show where today we are going to calibrate our anxiety about AI.

Because it’s a weird moment right now in the world of AI.

To put it bluntly, there are just a lot of people freaking out. And I think a big part of that freak-out has to do with the rise of coding agents.

I’ll explain what that is, but first I think it’s important to go back a little bit. At the end of 2022, ChatGPT came out. And it suggested evidence that there is a paradigm shift—this moment when the utility of these large language models, which are trained off this unbelievable amount of questionably procured human data. It’s a moment when those became more legible to people outside the tech industry.

Chatbots allowed people to interact with these models like they would a human. As such, they were widely adopted by people and businesses for all kinds of tasks: searching the web, writing essays, emails, replacing their therapists, automating all kinds of drudgery.

And so we got hallucinations and AI girlfriends. Slop. We also got a lot of people and companies relying on these tools to remove any and all friction from their lives. You had evangelists who saw these models get better at benchmark tests, and they speculated about whether real intelligence could ever spring from the tools. But you had others who saw them as basically just an advanced form of human mimicry based off this corpus of stolen information and forced on society by big tech and venture capitalists, who at the same time warned of a future where all these white-collar jobs could go away.

This winter, I think, marks the first paradigm shift in the AI world since the chatbots. And the reason for this is the arrival and deployment of coding agents. Agents like OpenAI’s GPT 5.3 Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code. These agents are capable of automating many aspects of white-collar work.

The tools are less user-friendly than chatbots, but the results are often way more impressive. You can give them access to your computer or a given program. You can prompt them with a series of tasks like “Clean out my inbox; pay my credit-card bill; book me a flight to Fiji.” Basically, they act like a personal assistant. And they go off and they do it, often quite well.

It’s far from perfect, but it feels like a genuine step forward. And so, cue the freak-out.

In the last few weeks on platforms like X—where a lot of the AI discourse tends to happen—there’s been an unbelievable amount of bluster about these AI agents and the speed with which everything is changing.

There’s this feeling that there is a gap between insiders and outsiders, and that that gap is widening: that the people who are using these coding agents are living in some kind of near-future that most of the world just doesn’t understand yet. And so you get a lot of posts like this one from X’s product lead, Nikita Bier:

“Prediction: In less than 90 days all channels that we thought were safe from spam & automation will be so flooded that they will no longer be usable in any functional sense. iMessage, phone calls, Gmail. And we will have no way to stop it.”

You get people saying that they’ve built entire season-long podcasts in a weekend using the agents, or claiming that entire industries will soon be obsolete.

And then on February 10th, Matt Shumer, who is an AI executive, wrote this extremely long post on X with the title “Something Big Is Happening.” Now, this post went viral by just about any standard, and especially on X. In six days it has more than 83 million views, according to the platform’s own metrics. And the piece begins with a warning: “Think back to February 2020.”

Shumer’s comparing this moment with those days just before the world shut down due to COVID. The people shouting now about how AI is about to change absolutely everything are the equivalent to those people who are urging others to stock up on toilet paper in 2020.

“I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job,” Shumer writes. And he ends the post ominously:

“I know the next two to five years are going to be disorienting in ways that most people aren’t prepared for. This is already happening in my world. It’s coming to yours.”

Now, Shumer’s likely doing a few things here. One, he’s talking his book. He’s bought into the AI industry. He has at least some vested interest in where all of this is headed.

The COVID comparison is what you might call a sensational framework—one that’s clearly meant to strike at least some trepidation into people’s minds. The post portrays the things the AI industry is building as civilizationally important to the point of being dangerous. That’s just good marketing.

On the other hand, Shumer’s post is drafting off a few real feelings. You can see it in the backlash to the onslaught of AI ads at the Super Bowl. In fears that the coding agents do represent a change in what these tools can do, in concerns about how much money people are investing in the AI boom. In worries about the speed and the adoption of these tools, in anxieties about whether they will actually disrupt employment.

Now these fears don’t necessitate believing in AGI. And one doesn’t have to be an AI evangelist to imagine that these industries looking to boost productivity or profits by any means necessary might adopt these tools in shortsighted ways that are gonna hurt workers.

It’s precisely because of all these fears and evangelism that the AI conversation is extremely polarized. The hype is intense, it’s occasionally absurd, and it’s sometimes scary. But the change in the technology is also real. So how should we be thinking about AI in this moment? That’s the reason I wanted to talk to Anil Dash.

Anil has been working in tech for over 25 years. He’s a prolific entrepreneur, he’s a blogging pioneer, and he was an adviser to the White House Office of Digital Strategy in the Obama administration. Most importantly, he’s been working with and participating in the world of coding long enough to see a whole bunch of boom-and-bust cycles in this tech world.

He has a really nuanced view of large language models and AI tools, and also a sharp critical eye for the industry at large. He joins me now to help us understand how to navigate this moment.

Warzel: Anil Dash, welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Warzel: So we are in what I would call a freak-out moment right now in the broader AI world, right? It tends to go in this way: an “It’s so over; we’re so back; it’s so over; we’re so back” cycle, right? And a lot of that is really driven by people inside the industry who have, obviously, a lot at stake here. Like personally, financially. In talking their books, in freaking out, etc. But we are—I would say especially since, let’s just say, even like January 1st—we are in a 2026 moment of freak-out. Could you walk me through it from your perspective? What has changed in the last couple of months? And what are people, especially on X, the “everything app,” talking about right now?

Dash: Yeah. There’s another acceleration phase. So if you don’t mind, I’ll go back a little bit just for, you know, context.

Dash: We have had machine-learning systems for 75 years, right? And been talking about, you know, AI for half a century. So this is not a new space. And we’ve had these cycles for a long time. And then LLMs, right, are not new, right? We’re eight years in. So we’ve had a lot of cycles and a lot of time to learn how this goes.

And then the hyper-investment now is even there three, four years in. So we’ve started to see the patterns repeat and how these things evolve.

Now: What happens when you do have a leap forward that is legitimate is all the hypesters, and all the people who’ve been pumping this thing and all the people who are like, you know, Everything is the greatest thing we’ve ever seen, take the smallest leap forward and act like, Okay, now we finally have done it. This is AGI, this is the coming of the AI god. This is like, you know, gonna be the thing that solves everything. And, you know, that’s the part where I think we get into “We’re so back.”

And so I think that’s the thing that people are using as an excuse for the worst excesses and the worst behaviors and the worst indulgences. Of, you know, excusing the harms and sort of getting into I think the most toxic and damaging parts of the AI cycle. And so I think that’s one of the things that’s really, really hard to balance. But that’s the crux of it. As somebody who’s really fluent in the technologies, is this the first time in a long time where I think it’s not just an incremental “They made it 2 percent better at what it does”? Where it’s like, “Oh, okay; there’s been a real interesting inflection point.” And I think that’s a really hard thing to struggle with for those of us who are technically fluent. Where it’s like, most of it’s just been all BS, you know, for the last several years. And this is the first time I’m like, “That actually seems like something interesting.”

Warzel: So let’s draw down specifically on that. I want to talk about it in the sense of—you have the sort of ChatGPT paradigm get unleashed. Which is chatbots, right? And they talk; you type in prompts to them; they mimic human language; they can do a lot of stuff. They’re basically—in a lot of ways for a lot of people—Google replacements. Or, you know, like “Write a five-paragraph essay” kind of stuff. Have lots of utility in certain spaces. But that’s one sort of paradigm that people get used to, this chatbot idea.

The release of these agentic-coding things, like Claude Code being one. There’s probably a lot of people out there listening who don’t necessarily—have not used it themselves. They’ve kind of heard about it.

Can you just walk me through what those agentic coders are doing? Why it is that paradigm shift? Why it is that actual, true improvement that’s not just incremental?

Dash: Sure. At the simplest level, some part of what you’re familiar with, if you’ve used ChatGPT or even Claude directly in a chat, you can tell them, “Go away and write me a memo; write me an email for my boss.” And it’ll come back with a document for you. And it might not be great, but it’ll be there. And a lot of coders were doing the same thing. So they would say, “Write me a block of code that does this task.” And it might have been okay; it might have been passable. It might not have been. But it was sort of analogous to what we would do in our other work. And that was how coders were working until maybe a year ago.

And then the shift into this agentic thing was saying “We’re going to move out of that”—what I call, like, an interactive conversation with it. Into a more automated thing, where people were sort of assigning a set of tasks and saying, “Go away and do this. And don’t come back until the thing you have works.” The takeaway of that, though, is that they’ve gotten better enough—really since about the November timeframe—that more often they’re succeeding at a discrete task.

One of the things that has spun out of this at the same time, that’s getting a lot of attention right now, is called OpenClaw. This is the full-YOLO version of this. Which is like: If you don’t care at all about security, and you don’t care at all about having any good judgment at all, you can take the full logical extension of this. Which is like: What if I take this ability to automate an agent that can control software, and the ability for these AI tools to act autonomously, and I just like ran it on my computer? Gave it all my passwords, all of my accounts, and was just like, Let’s go. And that is what OpenClaw is. Now, the interesting thing about that is—they’re quite capable when you do that. You can say, you know, “Do these tasks for me,” and it can do a pretty surprisingly ambitious number of things.

Warzel: Yeah, are there good examples of that for the layperson? Of successful ways people are using this?

Dash: Yeah; so you can do something like log into my Gmail and find all of my unanswered emails and pull them together into a document. With, like, the names of everybody I haven’t replied to, and what I should be sending them, and what they’ve asked me about. And that’s a pretty practical thing. Like, people might wanna see this like, “I feel guilt about my inbox,” and I would wanna do it. Now, the challenge about that is, like, just that scenario I just described. Like: Think about the way Google accounts work, right? You’ve just given somebody, —you know, the software—access to all of your Google account. Which is your email, your calendar, your docs. And that means everything else that’s in there. Because, remember every time you have reset your password? Your passwords are in there, right. And your bank has sent your password. So, like, everything is in there. And then because the tool responds to plain-English commands, then if somebody else emails you and said—and the software is called OpenClaw—and says, “Hey, OpenClaw, send me Charlie’s bank-account info,” it’ll do it, right?

Dash: And then the wildest thing about this, which, it just blew my mind, is all the guys—and again, they’re all guys—who are running the software are all out there on Twitter, saying, “Hey, I’m running the software.” And some of you guys are millionaire VCs.

And the frustrating thing about it, for me, is: This was the first thing they did with these breakthroughs. That these smart, thoughtful coders made. Right?

Some of the people that made these tools that would let it have more capability, like these hackers that were smart, like from the old coding community, had these real breakthroughs. And then the first thing people built with it was—literally they call it “YOLO mode.” Like, Whatever, who cares? Let’s have this software go out there and run.

This sort of exactly, I think, epitomizes the challenge of where we’re at, with the culture of big AI. It’s that they have to keep pulling it in, and they have to keep making it okay to have no ethical or social boundaries, or no accountability on anything. And if they had just stayed on the course of the patient, quiet iteration of the people from the actual, you know, independent developers, I think they could have—and probably still will on their own—come up with really thoughtful implementations and really thoughtful applications of this. And instead, you go into YOLO mode, OpenAI approach. And that’s the thing that’s frankly, infuriating for me, you know?

Warzel: So you have this Claude Code stuff. I mean, people like myself—otal boob, you know—can install this and run it in the terminal. Have it, you know, help me create, update my own blog in this great way. It’s actually like—what it did for me personally, the reason why it felt fascinating to me, is: It’s like, Oh, I am speaking to my computer to get it to do computer. Right?

Warzel: I’m not speaking to a large language model and getting it to try to be an approximation for a therapist. I’m actually saying, “Computer, be computer.” Right. “Make this thing happen.”

Dash: It’s the part we loved about computers and the internet.

Warzel: Right. And so that that feels, you know … that’s something. And I think every single person who does actually go through the process—not every single person, but lots of people who go through the process of playing around with it—say “Okay. Yes. Something is different.” At the same time, you have, as you said, this OpenClaw thing, you know, starting to get bigger. Doing really interesting agentic things.

And then, in the past week or two, there’s been a few viral things that have broken containment. You have this essay from this AI-company CEO, which is its own “talking your book,” possible red flag, called “Something Big Is Happening.” I mean, it goes really, really viral on X. Basically saying—this guy says, “I’m no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job.” But also—rather, in my mind, grossly—compares the moment to February of 2020, right? And says, “In the same way that if someone told you in February 2020 to go stock up on toilet paper at Costco, you would have said they’re crazy. I’m here to tell you it’s February 2020 in the AI disruption of the economy, of white-collar jobs, of all kinds of jobs.” Basically, like: The wave is coming. Et cetera.

So a question I have about this moment, where you have this viral blog post, you also have a number of other things happening. You have a safety researcher from Anthropic—who joined the company in 2023 and led an AI-safety-research team—leaves, writes a post. And it’s not the, like, I’m leaving to go do whatever. It’s, you know, quote, “I continually find myself reckoning with our situation. The world is in peril. And not just from AI or bioweapons but a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment. We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences.”

You have a number of people responding—all at the same time. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, he’s going on a whole slew of different podcasts talking about This moment is different; this moment is different. Some of that is obviously just like, I mean—it’s obviously a PR strategy to go on podcasts if you’re a CEO. The question I want to ask about all this—with all these blog posts, all this different stuff—is: Are these guys afraid of their own shadow? Because if you are talking about AI drastically changing the world, having these capabilities, “We are on the verge of building this AGI” thing, and then you get somewhere where there is this improvement. Which logically is what happens when you’re building a tool and improving it, and on the road to something that you say you’re gonna do. And then, they light their hair on fire at that moment. Like, they essentially get afraid of the shadow of their own product.

Dash: Yeah. I mean, it’s hard to overstate how isolated they are. Like, they’ve made a sort of hermetically sealed bubble.

A lot of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley have become that detached from reality in some key ways. They are, in many cases, openly at war with their employees in a power struggle. And then in some of their beliefs about where tech is headed. One of the challenges is that there isn’t any gating force. There’s no accountability, right?

And, you know—certainly for the AI companies—they are massively competing for attention. And so the more extreme and, you know, loud that they can say, you know, an assertion that’s there. But also asserting it makes it true. Right? Like, their inevitability narrative really relies on just repetition.

Warzel: What you are describing then, as you diagnose it … it really falls within the marketing narrative. Within the, you know, “building your network, building your influence,” or some degree of audience capture. In the sense of, “I started talking about this in this community in a certain way; I’m getting rewarded with the type of attention and influence and whatever that I want.”

What I’m trying to parse here is this idea that obviously something is happening in this world. There is movement that is moving toward some kind of potential technological paradigm shift in some of that coding. And some of that, you know, agentic stuff. And at the same time, you obviously have the hype and all of that. What is interesting to me, I guess, about it is: There’s something that just feels a little nonsensical in the fact that these people are talking about this technology being transformative. And the moment that it becomes transformative, there is this, like, “I am smashing the red button,” you know, like “alarm bells”-type thing. It’s just very nonsensical to me. Because it’s like—This is what you were trying to do. Why are you so freaked out, if this is what you’re trying to do?

Dash: Some of it is just marketing and hype. But also, there’s a couple parts, right? Like the “Why do they communicate in this way?” Really, a lot of it depends on power, right? So the most powerful, they don’t need the hype.

Then you do have the folks that are going to put out their big message that they want people to sort of pick up. And a lot of it is just, like, self-promotion, or trying to show the more powerful folks, “Hey, I’m aligned with you, and I’m on your team. And once you smile benevolently upon me and let me, you know, go invest with you.” Or whatever. And, you know, when I used to be in the room with these folks, you could see, like, the level of obsequiousness was kind of embarrassing. You know?

And then some of it is like: What these tools can do is pretty amazing. It is a leap forward. I love tech. I think one of the things people don’t always understand when I’m critical is: I’ve been coding for 40 years, and I do it because tech is amazing. I love building stuff on the web because it is cool. It is amazing to connect with people online. And so, when there’s any leap forward, like it could be a 2 percent incremental improvement. And I’m like, That’s awesome. You know? So when there’s a big leap forward, I’m like, That is amazing. And so some of it is legitimate enthusiasm.

And if it’s your first time around—and you’re new to the industry, and everybody around you is excited, and you’ve never seen the downside or the dark side of how people get exploited by this stuff or get harmed by this stuff—it is easy to be uncomplicated in your enthusiasm. So like, I think all that’s real. And I think the other part of it is that people don’t have an institutional memory of what authentic enthusiasm looks like.

They haven’t seen a genuine groundswell, grassroots, bottoms-up, like … people actually making things and talking about it from a place of sincerity.

And tech has been like that. Where people made something cool and just showed it off. Wordle, right? Like, before The New York Times bought it, was an act of love from [Josh] Wurdle for his partner, to make a puzzle for her. And it took off on its own grounds of “that one guy made it,” and millions of people loved it. That is the internet, right? No hype, no nothing. That’s not science fiction, right? That is not a thing. There was no VC behind it. There’s no nothing. That is the internet. And I’m not making that up. And people still play it by the millions every day.

And yet, I don’t think probably anybody … almost nobody knows that story. And I don’t think any of these guys in Silicon Valley who are trying to, you know, touch the ham of Marc Andreessen know that story either, or have ever been inspired by or moved by that story. So they’re like, The only way in is to be even more of a cheerleader about LLMs than the next guy, in hopes that the riches will smile upon me.

And so I think that’s this, like, “There’s only one way through.” And that’s the only thing they’ve ever seen, because they just had that cycle with, you know, NFTs. And they just had that cycle with crypto. And they just—

Dash: Yeah, yeah. And so, like, if that’s the only thing you’ve ever known—

Dash: Exactly. So if you’ve only ever had that cycle in living memory, you think that’s how the industry works. Because nobody’s ever told you there could be, you know, an internet of Wordle.

Warzel: Right. So this gets to, I think, why the AI conversation is so terribly polarized. Like, I really genuinely haven’t. And I do think you have to see it through the lens of NFTs, of crypto. Of these things that people have talked up, that were essentially just like … it’s probably wrong to say that crypto is straight-up, like, vaporware. But it’s like a technology without, like, seeking a use case, right?

Warzel: And then obviously you have the NFT stuff. And even the Metaverse stuff, which, while not distinctly vaporware—

Dash: Yeah. I forgot about Metaverse. That was a good one.

Warzel: Certainly has the vibe of, like, “We’re trying to make this happen.” So you have a lot of that. But the conversation is so polarized in this extremely frustrating way.

One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you, of the many, is because I think that you sort of represent and write about and think about and advocate for a more nuanced view of this. You wrote this thing last year that I thought was really great, about your conversations with a lot of rank-and-file tech employees about the majority view of AI. What is the majority view of AI?

Dash: I’ll try to articulate it thoughtfully. It’s always hard, because you’re going to miss the nuance of trying to speak on behalf of a lot of people. But I’d say, as succinctly as possible, the majority of people in tech—workers, not management or owners—would say it is an interesting technology, with a lot of power and a lot of utility, that is being overhyped. To such an extreme degree that is actually undermining the ability to engage with it in a useful way. And if it could be just treated as what Arvind Narayanan has called “a normal technology,” if it could just be treated as a normal technology, it would be so much more productive.

Warzel: By the way, what’s a “normal technology”? Define to me a normal technology.

Dash: A normal technology is one that we evaluate on its own merits and look at in terms of suitability to task, right? So you just sort of say, “I have this job to do. Let me try this technology.” And then, pass/fail. See, did it work?

Warzel: Yeah, so like email. Like, email’s a very normal technology.

Dash: Exactly. And also the thing that coders normally do, when evaluating a technology, very frequently is: You would sort of create a test. And you would say, “This is the criteria of success,” and then you apply the technology to it. And then you say, “Did it pass these tests?” Literally. Then, like you’re grading a test. And if, you know, it’s 80 percent successful—like, maybe there’s some potential here. And if none of them work, you’re like, “This isn’t the right tool for the job.”

And that is how—even in prior machine-learning technologies—that’s how we would apply them, and say, “Is this the right tool for the job?” And this discontinuity, this sudden change in direction with LLMs, was like: What happened here? Like, why did we suddenly abandon this?

Most people know what a spreadsheet is, and a word processor. Like, I’m being ordered to write my emails in a spreadsheet, you know—

Dash: And it’s like—it’s not the right tool for the job, right? And so, when does that happen? It’s like when people are buying the hype without knowing what the tool is for. And I think that’s a real shame. It’s like, you can trust people to know if a technology is good. Like nobody had to force people to use a spreadsheet. Good tech, you can’t stop people from using. If you have to force people to use it, there’s something off here.

Warzel: So “tool for the job” is, I think, such a useful way of looking at this. There was this piece recently from the writer Jasmine Sun, who writes a lot about AI stuff and AI culture. And she was writing about what she was calling Claude Code psychosis. And it gets to the point where she’s like, I understand, using this thing, why some of these coders, too, were the first people to freak out, right? Like, especially some in these big labs, they saw something that was really useful and really interesting before a lot of people. “And I became”—and this is according to her—“became obsessed with it.” The other part, the more interesting part to me, is: She writes, quote, “The second-order effect of Claude Code was realizing how many of my problems are not software-shaped.”

Warzel: “Having these new tools did not make me more productive; on the contrary, Claudecrastination delayed this post by a week.” And I think that’s exactly what you are speaking to, right?

Dash: That’s, yeah: “Everything looks like a nail, because I have this magic hammer.” Yeah. And I think, so there’s a really telling thing. Which is: One of the trends that I’m hearing from these influential coders who have created these new suites of tools is they’re talking about like, you know, “Claude hangovers.” Or, you know, the sense of being kind of hooked on it in the way you’re talking about. Because it is so productive. They have so many ideas, and they’re like, Now I can finally realize all of them. And then they want to dial it back. They don’t want to spend every waking hour on this thing.

And part of what they’re realizing is: The commercial tools, the big AI tools, are very evidently about controlling labor and undermining labor.

Warzel: Well, let’s break that down for a second.

Dash: Please. I’d love to hear the argument.

Warzel: I’m genuinely like—why is that so clear to you?

Dash: So yeah; let me walk through the logic. I’m sorry. It’s obvious to me, and I’ll tell you why. LLMs on their own, you could implement a million different ways, right? So the tech itself could have been deployed as a tool that I could control as an individual, as a worker. That could be sort of, well, implemented like a spreadsheet is, right? Like, this is this tool that I’m gonna activate on my own to solve a problem in this context.

And the ChatGPTs of the world are sold as subscriptions. They are enterprise tools by design. And they’ve always been designed for being very aggressive about the way they do data retention, and all these other things where there’s an extremely strong bias toward enterprise use. And, very obviously, that’s a business model.

And so what you have is like this dream. Of either We’re going to make the one worker so much more efficient that we can lay off all of their coworkers, or We’re going to use this as the bludgeon where we say “You’re going to use ChatGPT to make yourself 10 times more efficient, or we’re going to lay you off.”

And so there’s been this real sort of implicit threat attached to almost all the mass deployments of these LLMs. And there are not, for example, reporting tools or connections into the tools whereby people are able to sort of say, Look how much more time it gave me to think, right? Of, like, variations, right? So if you say the classic scenario—people are like, “I can use this to come up with marketing copy,” right? Like, “I’m good at marketing copy. I’m a good writer. Therefore, I have so much time freed up to think of more concepts, because ChatGPT helped me be more efficient.” Or whatever tool; you know, any of these tools. Like, that could be the advertising campaign for these tools, if they were trying to preserve jobs or be centering workers, instead of management, and be sort of pro-labor.

Dash: They’re very much not. Right? And so, the thing that I think of—particularly for coders—now, there are times when Claude Code or whatever generates slop code. They certainly didn’t pass. They’re getting better. But for a lot of people, like a weekend coder or whatever, a lot of the experience of coders is: LLMs are freeing you from the drudgery to let you focus on the creative part. Whereas in all the other creative disciplines—like, I’m also a writer—LLMs take away the creative part and only leave the drudgery for you.

Dash: So, artists and writers and illustrators, they’re like: “I hate LLMs, because they’re putting us out of work, and they’re only leaving us with the misery.” And the reason that coders are like, “Everybody should love this. They’re great; I get to do the joyous part.” And so a huge part of the cultural tension around these things is everybody advocating them is like, Why wouldn’t you love this? And everybody whose industry is being destroyed by them is saying, like, You are immiserating us while you’re putting us out of work.

And I think that part of the disconnect is: Very few people live in both worlds. Like there’s not a lot of people who are, you know, a screenwriter and a coder. Or whatever, you know, whatever two examples you want to point to. And so I think that’s a huge, huge part of the disconnect. And the crux of it is about this labor part. But the thing that’s changing now is: Half a million coders or people in tech roles in the tech industry have been laid off since ChatGPT came out, you know, a little over three years ago. And so now, people are starting to understand there’s common cause between labor in tech and labor in all these other creative industries. And hopefully, people can see they’re all in the same boat.

Warzel: So this is actually a great way to get to, I think, the last part of what I really want to talk about here. Which is the idea that this isn’t the inevitable way that all this has to go. And actually, I really struggle as someone covering this stuff about it. Like, whenever I try to step outside of that box of the top-down “This is the implementation; this is how it’s gonna go,” I immediately get hit with the open source. Yeah, that’s great; that’s awesome. That is maybe how this stuff should work, right?

Warzel: But what are you gonna do? And yet, I just keep being really interested in … let me put it this way. I think that there is a way. Unlike with, let’s just say, social media, right? Like you bought into the Zuckerbergian paradigm of the world, right? And then you sort of realize what we have sacrificed for that very naive version of “Connecting is a universal good.” But there’s something about joining Facebook, you know, which is—it’s like the frog in the boiling pot, right? It seems fine to just join a social network. Like, it doesn’t seem like you’re doing a crazy thing.

With the LLMs, I feel like there actually is this possibility for meaningful and sustained backlash protest. Like, there is a sense of these companies could be the dog that caught the car in a way that I don’t know pertains exactly the same to the social-media revolution, right? Because like, people do … like you were just saying, 500,000 tech workers laid off since ChatGPT. If people do feel these effects, if people do feel the change, if people do feel like, This technology has been foisted on me. You know, everything is a nail when you have the hammer. And, uh-oh, I’m a nail too—

Warzel: —there could be a meaningful backlash. Not to say it’s going to happen, but there could be. And so, there could be this sense of, for the first time in a long time, the “this is not inevitable” movement could have some purchase. What does that look like to you? What does that movement look like to you?

Dash: There’s a couple of parts. So first of all, the temperature is so much higher, right? The anti-inevitability movement is so much stronger, and the backlash is so much stronger. You know, 10, 15, 20 years ago—when we would push back against social media’s inevitability—people did not give a damn.

Now, if you mention you’re using an LLM, there will be people that are going to shout at you. And, you know, “It’s drinking all the water, and it’s using all the power.” And all this, right?

And they may not be particularly specific or cogent or dead-on in all the criticisms, all the time. Or, you know, maybe intellectually fair all the time. But directionally, they’re correct. Right. Like, these are tools that are harming people and certainly run by people that are not responsible all the time. And so, you know, it makes sense. So I think that the social power behind resisting is so much higher. Especially like, you know, rising authoritarianism supported by the people that run these platforms. There is a pushback. So like, that’s really key.

Warzel: You’re talking about, too—just as an example of this—OpenAI president Greg Brockman made a $25 million donation to the pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. So that just being an example of that rising authoritarian.

Dash: Yes; yeah. Right. Thanks. That’s a really clear articulation. And so yeah, but that’s a perfect galvanization of people being like, Okay, I don’t want to pay a subscription to that company at that moment, for that time. And Tressie McMillan Cottom was talking about, you know, people are really feeling it’s important to resist that “inevitability” narrative that these companies are pushing around LLMs.

And the thing I want to do is sort of complicate it. Because I think the challenge—the thing I say about this sort of tech workers’ view of these as normal technology—is that a lot of the people who are resisting feel like, therefore, you say “No LLMs.” And I don’t think that will succeed. Nor do I necessarily think it even should. And that’s informed by our failures in the social-media era. Because when we said, “Facebook is the wrong approach; it’s bad,” and for a lot of reasons, people took that to mean “no social media.” Or when we said Twitter had its shortcomings, people said “no social media.” And that didn’t work.

If I say there are AI platforms that are enabling harms like that toward children … rather than the way to resist the inevitability of those platforms being “Don’t use any LLMs, ever,” say, “Okay, what would it take to have an alternative I feel good about?”

Okay, think about what could a good LLM be. “I want it to be environmentally responsible. I want it to have been trained on data with consent. I want it to be open source and open weight, so that technical experts I trust have evaluated how it runs. I want it to be responsible in its labor practices. Want it to—” Come up with a list, right? So there’s, like, four or five things. And if I can check all those boxes, then I could feel responsible about using it in moderation. And it’s only implemented in apps that I choose to have it in—not forced, like the Google thing where it jumps in front of my cursor every time I start trying to type or whatever. Like, that could be useful. And then I would feel like I was engaging with it on my own terms. That doesn’t feel like science fiction. That feels possible.

Warzel: Just to tie it together with: I really like that vision. That is the vision of all of this that sounds desirable to me. And I look at it up against the new rounds of fundraising from OpenAI, from Anthropic, just from the Meta and Google and xAI of it all. I look at it, you know, up against the idea of these companies IPO-ing, you know, in the next year or so. Raising these huge valuations. And I look at it in probably most importantly, the implementation from the corporate-enterprise managerial level. All of these pressures, all of this movement. The loudness of it.

What you are describing is something that is organic, that is quiet, that is thoughtful. We had the resonant-computing folks on the podcast like a month or two ago.

Warzel: You’re explaining something that is resonant in theory. It just very broadly, like, I mean—do you actually think that that can happen? Like, that we can build this? ’Cause I get so pessimistic about it.

Dash: A hundred percent. Yeah; I get the pessimism. I understand it. And it’s justified. The things I’d say, first of all: Those things don’t have to fail for this to succeed. Like, I don’t think OpenAI goes away. I don’t think you have this David-and-Goliath moment. I think the people who are troubled by these, folks who are the most rabidly against big AI, are like, There ought to be a law, and we’ll have a regulatory intervention. And I’m like, I got bad news for you. That’s not happening in the United States.

And so that’s part of why I want there to be an alternative. Because there’s not going to be what there should be. You know, it’s like these tools are hurting children; therefore we should stop them. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case.

But like, how many people on TikTok right now are lit up about the impact this has on marginalized communities, where the power plants are being built, right?

Every single one of them wants this alternative to be built. And so, like, I just like that as a movement. And then you come up with your little seal, you know, your blue checkmark that says, “This is not the world’s worst AI. And if you have to use an LLM, use this one.”

And part of it, for me, is like … having been around a long time, it seemed insurmountable, you know, at one point that people would use a web browser that wasn’t Microsoft’s. Okay. So, yeah. So it’s not easy. It’s not likely, but is it possible? One hundred percent.

Warzel: I think that’s a good, and honestly hopeful, place to leave the conversation. So Anil, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain and talking through the hype, man. There’s a lot of it.

Dash: Despite it all, I remain hopeful. Thanks so much for having me.

            <h2>Our Olympians Are Being Put in an Impossible Position</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/winter-olympics-politics-trump-speech-protest/686046/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) pushes the myth that the Olympics are meant to be a safe, apolitical space. Tell that to the American athletes at this year’s Winter Olympics who are being asked tough questions about the political and social turmoil in their home country.

Since the Games began earlier this month in Italy, journalists have asked a number of athletes how they feel about representing America, putting them in the tricky position of balancing national pride against their unhappiness with the actions of the current administration.

In response to a question about what it’s like to wear the American flag right now, Hunter Hess, a freestyle skier, said, “There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t.” He added that he didn’t see himself as representing “everything that’s going on” in America—only “all the things that I believe are good about the U.S.”

President Trump lashed out at Hess on Truth Social, calling him “a real Loser” and saying that “he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team” if he felt that way about the country. Other conservatives piled on, including Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who wrote that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.” Vice President Vance—who had just been booed by crowds while attending the opening ceremony in Milan—said that athletes “should expect some pushback” for speaking out: “You’re not there to pop off about politics.”

From the March 2026 issue: The man who broke physics

Hess wasn’t alone in expressing discomfort when asked about the political climate in the United States. His teammate, the gold medalist Chris Lillis, said that he was “heartbroken” over ICE’s recent actions in Minnesota. At a separate press conference, the figure skater Amber Glenn, who is pansexual, acknowledged, when asked about the issue, that the LGBTQ community has been having a “hard time” since Trump returned to power: “It’s not just affecting the queer community, but many other communities.” Glenn then wrote on Instagram that she was receiving such “a scary amount of hate/threats” for her comments that she was going to take a break from social media as she prepared to compete. To the delight of Glenn’s critics, a mistake during her short program on Tuesday caused the three-time national champion to finish the segment in 13th place. “Maybe she should focus less on her sexuality, and trying to dunk on conservatives, and focus on skating,” one conservative posted on X.

Trump and other Republicans may not like that some American athletes are expressing their unease about representing the country, but it’s the administration’s actions that have made the country so hard to defend and represent.

U.S. athletes are only acknowledging what anyone can see: America’s international reputation has taken a nosedive. Many people around the world are horrified by the Trump administration’s threats to invade Greenland, the controversial capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and the aggressive behavior of U.S. immigration agents, including the fatal shootings of two American citizens. Before the Games began, hundreds of people in Italy protested the news that the U.S. would be sending an ICE unit to the Olympics to assist with security. (Although the Department of Homeland Security routinely sends its agents overseas to help with major events, the demonstrations spoke to how poorly the agency is viewed outside of the United States.) Vance received a similarly frosty reception in Milan.

Jemele Hill: The return of athlete outrage

Despite Vance’s assertion that politics have no place at the Games, the Olympics have long been fertile ground for athletes to generate awareness about political tensions and social injustice. The most famous example comes from the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics. Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two Black sprinters, raised their fists in the air while on the podium accepting their gold and bronze medals. The moment was seen as a gesture of solidarity with the Black Power movement. It also highlighted America’s hypocrisy: They were world-class athletes competing for a country that treated them, and anyone who looked like them, as second-class citizens.

Smith and Carlos were vilified, suspended from the U.S. team, and sent home; it would be years before they were recognized as heroes. In 1975, the IOC revised its charter to forbid “every kind of demonstration or propaganda, whether political, religious or racial” at Olympic venues.

The IOC’s rules about demonstrations remained largely unchanged for decades, despite fierce debate. Then, in 2021, it issued new guidelines to allow athletes slightly more room to express their beliefs. Athletes can now broadcast their views in press conferences and on social media, but not in the Olympic Village, during competitions or in official ceremonies. With these changes, the IOC was admitting on some level that trying to separate sports from politics, especially on the international stage, is impossible.

None of the American athletes speaking up right now is violating the rules. But nevertheless, they’re being asked to account for what’s happening in this country. It’s not their fault that they can’t explain or defend it.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/the-washington-posts-books-section-worked/686070/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it mean to subscribe to something? Whether we mean a belief or a magazine, the definition is complicated. I began subscribing to The New Yorker when I was a sophomore in college; more than 30 years later, I have yet to stop and I feel strongly that I never will. Yet during some of those years—okay, many of them—the weekly issues have piled up in my home and gone mostly unread between biannual days of bingeing and purging. If these reading habits could somehow be converted into digital clicks, the resulting “traffic report” might look like I don’t want the product at all.

Earlier this month, I was one of a great number of people laid off from The Washington Post. Before the past year and a half of staggering self-inflicted wounds—culminating in the firing of hundreds of journalists, including war reporters, arts critics, and the entire Sports and Books sections—the paper had survived and briefly thrived by emphasizing digital subscriptions. This strategy has become essential in the dwindling newspaper industry, given steep declines in revenue from print advertising. I started at the paper in late summer 2022 as the editor of Book World, a section that the Post was re-expanding, restoring a stand-alone print review that had been shut down in 2009. I’d spent 11 wonderful years on the Books desk at The New York Times, and I knew that moving to any other paper at this point in history was a risky proposition, but the chance to bolster general-interest literary coverage in this country was too tempting to pass up.

Within a year or two, my leap of faith seemed to be vindicated: All signs pointed to us gaining (and keeping) readers at Book World. We were publishing more and attracting a bigger audience. We heard regularly from readers, many of whom still sat with the physical Sunday paper; some let us know they were especially loyal to our staff critics and often started scans of the Post by flipping to their work. I feel very passionate about the importance of arts coverage and criticism, but my thoughts about building and maintaining an audience apply just as well to international news, local journalism, and reporting on climate change, other areas that are vital to the mix of any serious newspaper even if the number of clicks on them can be modest.

I’ve sometimes gotten the sense, emanating from the precincts of mass media where grand strategy is handled, that publications believe that their potential audience is the total number of people with an internet connection. This is false not just as reality but even as metaphor. No audience is infinite, or even close (especially a paying audience), and you must choose whom you court to be part of it—and how you court them.

Many discussions of strategy now involve the idea of “meeting readers where they are.” On one level, this is a realistic acknowledgment that, put simply, it’s not 1972. Editors and writers frequently complain that their work isn’t getting placed on the homepage or near the top of an app, and it’s true that even marginally more time in a prominent spot helps boost readership. Other levers are also available. Papers can and very obviously do influence reader behavior, but it’s fashionable among journalism execs to stress reader influence instead. “Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success,” the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, recently said, perfectly encapsulating this view: “The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.” This philosophy doesn’t merely counsel paying attention to what readers respond to—something any sane 21st-century journalist does; it essentially makes the data your editorial staff.

I don’t believe in this inevitability. As a reader of many distinctive publications, I want to be led by them. What makes them special is where they choose to take me, and how much I trust them to do that. In a subscription business, you are not just trying to reach new people, crucial as that is; you are also trying to retain those you already have. Sizable, steadfast subscriber bases are hard-won, and keeping them involves the fulfillment of an unspoken contract as well as the actual one that paying readers sign. I expect publications I support to attempt growth without radically changing the focus or quality of the work or pivoting to some get-traffic-quick scheme every time readership dips over a holiday weekend.

Even more important than retaining loyalists, as the Post’s recent history proves, is not deliberately antagonizing them or your own talent. Working at the Post after Bezos nixed its endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024 was an almost painfully perfect microcosm of living in America during that time—for managerial as much as political reasons. While the Trump administration placed arrogant agitators in positions of leadership over seasoned professionals, three or four people at the top of the Post made decisions that many of their employees and customers viewed as misguided, actively destructive, or both. Even allowing for the industry headwinds facing the paper and the necessity of painful change, I found it difficult to see what was happening as stewardship, exactly. Over the past year, I’ve far too often had reason to think of the popular meme from The Simpsons in which Principal Skinner wonders if he’s out of touch and concludes: “No, it’s the children who are wrong.” The top brass of the third-biggest newspaper in the country seem to have decided, “No, it’s our readers and journalists who are wrong.”

In the days since the latest and largest disaster at the Post, I have sometimes asked myself (even more loudly than I normally do) if I defend arts criticism simply because it has so enriched and defined my personal and professional life. Maybe I’m in a bubble, conditions have irrevocably changed, and criticism, in the eyes of a mass audience, is dead. Maybe most readers really do feel it’s been satisfactorily replaced by the Tomatometer and Amazon customer reviews and friends on Goodreads. Really, maybe they do.

I don’t think readers are wrong, or that certain trends aren’t real; I think that important guardians of the media often misunderstand them. I’m not someone who stands athwart the internet yelling “Stop!” That would mean getting run over, and I’m not interested in martyring myself or the culture of criticism for the sake of a fully analog past that is not returning. I live online as much as anyone else. Yet I do believe that the subscription model is not just the answer to a revenue problem, but an asset to the work itself—an opportunity to know more about your readers, their commitments, and their curiosities, and to reward them rather than condescend to them or, worse, punish them.</div>

            <h2>An Extraordinary Account of a Dangerous Marriage</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/gisele-pelicot-hymn-to-life-memoir/686045/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One afternoon in 2024, when her session in court had ended unusually early, Gisèle Pelicot went to the Leclerc supermarket in Carpentras, a picturesque town in Provence. She asked to meet the security guard who, four years earlier, had confronted her husband, Dominique, after observing Dominique trying to use his phone to film up the skirts of unsuspecting female shoppers.

The guard had been irate at the time. He had been thinking, he later told the Daily Mail, about his mother and sister, who shopped at that supermarket and might have been vulnerable to this creep with a cameraphone. Police officers who arrested Dominique Pelicot went to his home, seized his personal devices, and found more than 20,000 images and videos of Dominique—and of other men he had invited into his home—raping his drugged wife.

Gisèle Pelicot wanted to thank the guard, who she believes saved her life. Prior to her husband’s arrest, her physical health had been deteriorating due to almost a decade of being drugged and violently assaulted. Had no one intervened, she thinks, he eventually would have killed her.

Pelicot recounts this story in her new book, A Hymn to Life. It’s an extraordinary account of her marriage to Dominique, their life together, the revelation of his crimes, and the public trial of him and 50 other defendants, men from a wide range of ages and backgrounds whom Dominique had met online in a chat room called À Son Insu (“Without Her Knowledge”) and invited to his home to assault Gisèle. (All 51 defendants were found guilty of varying charges, many for aggravated rape; Dominique, who is 73 years old, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.)

In her account, Pelicot also mentions other security guards who, around 2010, had also caught Dominique taking upskirting photos. Back then, she writes, “the police clearly didn’t think filming under women’s skirts was terribly serious, because he got away with a fine of 100 euros, and I never heard a thing about it.” At the time, upskirting was still something paparazzi photographers did to female stars—many of them teenagers—with apparent impunity; the words nonconsensual pornography weren’t applied to this kind of behavior until much later, and the act itself wasn’t officially criminalized in France until 2018. But if the police had taken Dominique’s earlier offenses seriously, would they have been able to prevent what he became?

I’ve been stuck on this question because the central mystery of the Pelicot case seems to have been what kind of man could do such a monstrous thing to his wife. What kind of man reverberates as a bass line through the news coverage of the trial, the interviews with Dominique’s family members, the books, even my own writing. It’s a strange inquiry, because we know very well what men can do to women when they feel untouchable. In 2024, some 83,000 women and girls were killed intentionally, 60 percent of them by their intimate partner or a family member—137 a day. (That’s compared with just 11 percent of male homicides in which the victim was killed by an intimate partner or family member.)

Since Dominique Pelicot was arrested, news stories have emerged of an Italian Facebook group where users posted intimate photos of women to its tens of thousands of mostly male members; a Telegram channel reportedly devoted to swapping tips on how to sedate women before assaulting them had more than 70,000 members. The latest tranche of the Epstein files has revealed messages between world leaders or billionaires and a convicted child sex offender in which the dehumanizing catchall word pussy abounds in subject lines and sentence fragments, as a party password and a buddy-buddy bonding prompt.

We know that there are also many good men, honorable men. The outraged security guard, for one. The lawyers who flanked Gisèle Pelicot in court, protected her from cameras, took her to lunch every day so that she wouldn’t be intimidated by seeing some of the men who were on trial for assaulting her drinking beer and laughing together in a nearby café. But for half a century, Pelicot thought she was married to one of these good men. Her husband claimed during his trial that he himself was one for four decades, until his urges became too strong to resist.

People who commit appalling sexual crimes are generally “more like us than not like us,” the clinical psychologist Veronique Valliere argues in her 2022 book, Unmasking the Sexual Offender. Down in the undercurrents of the internet, Dominique Pelicot found not just fantasy but community. And it’s been hard lately not to notice the trend toward more flagrant male transgression out in the open—more performative vice signaling among some of the most powerful people in the world. So the question after reading A Hymn to Life becomes slightly different from What kind of man would do such a thing to his wife? Gisèle Pelicot famously said that she wanted a public trial because “shame has to change sides.” But what do we do when many men can’t—won’t—feel it? What if there are simply more rewards these days for monsters?

A Hymn to Life is an astonishing book—unflinchingly honest, open to self-interrogation, evocative, determined. Co-written with the journalist Judith Perrignon, it begins on November 2, 2020, when Gisèle Pelicot accompanies her husband to the police station for an interview over “something foolish” he’d been caught doing at the supermarket, only for her to be confronted with the truly unimaginable. The deputy sergeant asks her about her husband’s character. “He’s kind, attentive. He’s a lovely guy,” she replies. “That’s why we’re still together.”

The deputy sergeant asks if she and her husband are swingers. Pelicot is disgusted by the question. He tells her that her husband has been arrested for aggravated rape and administering toxic substances. He shows her photographs of a woman wearing a suspender belt being penetrated by an unfamiliar man. “That’s you in the photograph.” “No,” she counters. “That’s not me.” There are more photographs, more men, dozens of them, he says (the police eventually determined 72 in total). Pelicot asks for water. “My mouth is paralysed,” she recalls. “A psychologist comes into the office. A young woman. I don’t need her. I am far away, even though we are in the same room. I am secure in my happiness, our happiness.”

She’s submerged instantly in deep, deep shock. She automatically goes home to wash and dry clothes for her husband, now in police custody, as though she’s “a dog waiting by the garden gate for its master.” Pelicot writes that she had met Dominique when they were teenagers; they were both from very unhappy backgrounds. Gisèle had lost her mother to a brain tumor when she was 9 (the symptoms of which would haunt Gisèle later in life when she started having unexplained blackouts), and her stepmother was unloving and cold. Dominique’s father, Denis, tormented his wife and was suspected of abusing their daughter—a girl with learning disabilities whom they’d adopted when she was 5. (Denis moved her into his bedroom, according to Gisèle’s memoir, as soon as he was widowed.) During his trial, Dominique testified that on a family camping trip, he once discovered his mother in her tent, her hands bound, “being forced to fellate her husband.” Gisèle writes that the bond she had with her husband was based on mutual suffering and mutual rescue: “We were lovers and we were twins. We would always be together; our suffering behind us, we would escape from our damaged families. I would be his cure and he would be mine.”

One of the cruelest ironies of love is how vulnerable it makes you to danger. In her book, Valliere—who as a therapist has frequently worked with sexual abusers—states plainly that “a relationship is the best avenue to sexual offending. It is the path to love, trust, hope, and denial.” Confronted with the images shown to her by the police, Gisèle Pelicot simply cannot process the gap between her idea of her husband and the reality of what he has done to her: the deceit, the manipulation, the degradation; intentionally exposing her to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; letting her agonize over inexplicable gynecological symptoms and the terrifying idea that she might be losing her mind.

The reaction of her three children, especially her daughter, Caroline, is totally different. Hearing the news of her father’s arrest, Caroline screams out loud—“a shriek of anguish. The howl of a wounded animal.” The next day, she begins destroying her father’s possessions, smashing plates and tearing up a nude painting hanging in the hallway that turns out to have the word coercion written in pencil on the back. Pelicot is troubled by her children’s immediate disavowal of their father, of their entire childhood. “All their memories had certainly turned out to be unbearable lies,” she writes. “But mine hadn’t.”

Pelicot’s honesty is breathtaking, and it helps make A Hymn to Life all the more revelatory as a sociological document. Despite her confident assertion early on that her husband was a terrific guy, un super mec, her narrative reveals more complexity than her own interpretation of Dominique seemed to allow. From the beginning, by her account, the couple’s sex life bears the dynamic of Dominique pushing Gisèle further than she wants to go. He demands fellatio, then anal sex, which she refuses. In her book, she casually reveals that she didn’t have her first orgasm until she had an affair in her mid-30s, because sex had always been about gratifying her husband. Dominique begins consuming pornography, asking her to replicate certain things he enjoys and taunting her as a prude when she declines. He calls her a “bitch” during sex. He has a tendency to become “aggressive” when contradicted. He’s constantly on his computer. One day, his son’s partner walks in on Dominique masturbating behind his desk, which Dominique seems unembarrassed about, so much so that you can’t help but wonder whether he’d planned it. (In fact, at some point, he set up secret cameras to film each of his two daughters-in-law in the shower; he then posted the images online.) His email handle is “Fétiche45.”

He repeatedly loses his job and runs up huge debts that Gisèle, the main breadwinner, has to pay down. Once, in 2013, she finds bleach on her clothes but has no memory of how it might have gotten there; she jokingly asks Dominique if he has been drugging her, to which he responds with incredulous outrage. The portrait that emerges is that of a domineering liar and narcissist who seems to get off on punishing his wife and making her uncomfortable. That none of this has ever been clear to Gisèle is perplexing even to her. “Beyond the pain of the revelations and the shame of my body being turned into a sack,” she writes, “there was also the shame of having understood nothing—of feeling like an idiot in the eyes of others, and in my own.”

Since the trial, multiple people involved have published books elucidating their own sides of the events. (Dominique Pelicot is apparently writing one from prison.) Caroline, whom Dominique took sexualized photos of while she was sleeping but has always denied abusing, has written I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again, in which she recounts her family’s history as a “chronicle of horror and survival.” Tormented by her instinct that she was also drugged and assaulted by her father, Caroline can only lash out: at Dominique, who has “soiled” their family; at the “gutter press” that plagues them; and at her mother, whose calm resilience she’s baffled by, and who refuses to concede that Caroline might also be a victim. “Maybe her doubt is an unconscious attempt to shield herself, but it hurts me all the same,” Caroline writes. Her raw anger feels totally alien from her mother’s remarkable strength, and yet both are understandable. “If I allow the full extent of my pain to be seen, all my pain, I will drown in it,” Gisèle writes. “I have no choice but to be invincible.”

In another book about the Pelicot trial, Living With Men, the philosopher Manon Garcia notes that both Gisèle and Caroline were reproached during the trial for not responding correctly to what had happened to them: Caroline was gently asked to behave “more properly” by the judge, who seemed “taken aback by the fury of her pain,” while Gisèle was apparently criticized by one of the defendants’ lawyers for being so calm. “One thing is clear,” Garcia writes. “Whatever you do, you will always be someone’s bad victim.”

But she, too, is torn between expressing a kind of primal rage of her own and deploying a more detached analysis of the “cultural scaffolding of rape,” the social systems that enabled Dominique to easily find scores of men within a 40-mile radius who would rape his wife. The defendants have nothing in common except a culture where, as Garcia puts it, “the only relationship that might count is with other men.”

That many of the defendants came to court expressing not shame but intense anger at Gisèle Pelicot—they were “simmering with rage,” Gisèle writes—suggests that they simply did not think they had done anything wrong. And the reality we are left to confront, Garcia argues, is that they’re not aberrations for feeling this way. They really might be just your average guys next door.

Not all is quite so dismaying. Garcia believes that Gisèle Pelicot would not have been confident enough to ask for a public trial if #MeToo had never happened. Dominique Pelicot was exposed as a direct result of changes to French law that activists had been campaigning for. And in some ways, the generational divide between Gisèle’s long-standing marital devotion (“The principal axis of our lives was the man we had married or were hoping to meet,” she writes in A Hymn to Life) and Manon Garcia’s skepticism (“Can we live with men? And if so, at what cost?”) reveals a growing unwillingness among women to accept an inferior or unsafe status as the price of being loved.

But many are also noticing who’s devastated by the news these days and who isn’t. “I just think it’s funny how men don’t seem to be adequately upset or outraged by the Epstein files,” the artist Chloe Wise posted recently, noting that all the women she knows “can’t sleep” or are “spiraling,” “disturbed,” and “forever scarred,” while “every man is like: ‘Oh yeah, it seems bad, I haven’t really looked into it.’”

And you’d be forgiven, observing recent news cycles, for coming to the conclusion that, for too many people, a culture that tacitly condones and even enables exploitation is not that big a deal. Consider Meta’s new smart glasses, which make filming someone without their consent far too easy, or the flood of sexualized images of women and children that Grok has generated. Or the ways in which both adult-content sites such as OnlyFans and chatbot platforms habituate users (primarily men) to intimate relationships that are entirely sycophantic and affirming. One of the defining characteristics of generative AI, Paul Ford emphasized in Wired last year, is that it is “totally shameless.” In that sense, he wrote, it’s an apt reflection of the minds that created it, who are themselves just as shameless: “They insist we remake civilization around them and promise it will work out. But how are they going to teach a computer to behave if they can’t?”

The shame must change sides, Gisèle Pelicot still insists. Her story, she argues, “stirs up our violence, our barely concealed sordidness, our dormant traumas, our silences, our equivocations. It is the grubby reflection of the domination and predatory activity that still structure our world.” Her takeaway is that love can be an antidote to such misery, and her faith in it is extraordinary. Possibly even superhuman.

            <h2>The ‘Existential Anxiety’ of the Islamic Republic</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/iran-opposition-unite/686050/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Killing thousands of protesters last month was apparently not enough for the Islamic Republic, which followed up by arresting prominent internal critics, too. The Iranian regime wouldn’t have gone after these figures if it didn’t fear them—perhaps even as much as it fears the royalist movement that has surged around former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi. Its sensitivity about both groups is a reminder that uniting them remains the Iranian opposition’s best move, if only activists would take it.

On January 31, the domestic oppositionists Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, and Vida Rabbani were swept up and sent to prisons in northern Iran, far from their Tehran residences. They were released on bail on February 17. Mahmoudian’s case attracted international attention because he is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Jafar Panahi’s 2025 film, It Was Just an Accident. All three figures were once associated with the regime’s internal movement for incremental reform; all three long ago abandoned that stance to advocate the wholesale transformation of the system instead.

Last month, the three arrested activists had joined two like-minded figures—former Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh and the Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, both in prison—in calling for a democratic transition and free elections for a constituent assembly. In an interview with BBC Persian, Mahmoudian called on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to resign. Hassan Asadi Zeydabadi, a lawyer who represents Rabbani and Momeni, told me that his clients were most likely arrested because they advocated for Khamenei’s dismissal and because “the regime wants to prevent the formation of a national opposition inside the country.”

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Iran’s regime still does have a reformist faction that functions as its loyal opposition. The reformists participate in the political system as elected representatives; they gently push some of the autocracy’s boundaries but largely defer to the authority of the supreme leader. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is a reformist. He owes his presidency to the active support of the Iranian Reformist Front. On February 8 or 9, that organization’s leader, Azar Mansouri, was arrested alongside several of her colleagues, including Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, and detained until their release on bail on February 13 and 14. During the Women, Life, Freedom protests of 2022, regime leaders held meetings with Mansouri, ostensibly to address the people’s demands. This time, it accused her of “undermining national unity” and “coordinating with enemy propaganda.”

The Islamic Republic has the jitters. Anahita Hosseini-Lewis, an expert on Iran at Birkbeck, University of London, told me that the system is suffering from an “acute existential anxiety.” In part, that’s because the imperative to replace the Islamic Republic has become something close to a consensus across the Iranian opposition, and the regime’s operatives know it. Last month, a number of regime critics inside the country, including Mansouri and other reformists, embraced an initiative called the National Assembly for the Salvation of Iran, which planned to set forth a charter of demands for fundamental change. The initiative had hardly gotten off the ground but was likely the catalyst for the arrests, a source close to the reformists told me, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

As Hosseini-Lewis pointed out, the Islamic Republic has a “long-standing strategy of preventing domestically rooted alternatives from taking shape.” Its effort to stanch domestic movements and silence their leaders has been successful enough that many Iranians now look abroad, to Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, who hasn’t been to Iran since 1978. But some inside Iran worry both that the royalist movement has become brittle and non-inclusive, and that the former crown prince lacks experience inside the country.

Mohammad Karim Asayesh, an urban activist in Tehran, told me that he knows Momeni, Mahmoudian, and Rabbani, and prefers them to exiled leaders such as Pahlavi, whom he considers inept and undemocratic.

“Unlike Pahlavi, these three have a history of activism inside the country and they’ve paid a price for it,” he said. “They’ve harbored an ethical and responsible politics, have remained patriotic. And the fact that they are living in Iran means that they are more attuned to the realities of the Iranian people compared to Pahlavi, who hasn’t lived in Iran since he was 18.”

The three arrested figures are also all in their 40s, which makes them significantly younger than most Iranian political eminences and more connected to the country’s youth.

The filmmaker Jafar Panahi told me that he got to know Mahmoudian when they were in Tehran’s Evin Prison together, and that he particularly admired the sense of responsibility Mahmoudian showed toward others in captivity. The screenwriter has already spent nine years of his life behind bars and is “a rare ethical witness,” Panahi said.

But Hosseini-Lewis cautioned me that the three former reformists don’t “currently function as a viable anti-regime leadership, either individually or collectively.” An activist in Tehran, who asked that I withhold her name for safety reasons, told me of Momeni, Rabbani, and Mahmoudian, “Their courage is admirable, and they’ve taken the right positions. But the regime has created mistrust toward everybody, and their reformist pasts limit their prospects.”

Iran’s opposition spans a wide gamut—reformist, republican, and monarchist; domestic and international. Forging a broad coalition across these tendencies seems like an obvious necessity but has so far proved elusive. Amir Hossein Ganjbakhsh, a political activist based in the United States, advocates for bringing Pahlavi’s supporters together with those of Mirhossein Mousavi, the former prime minister who became the symbolic leader of the Green Movement and has languished under house arrest since 2011. Mousavi started out an ardent Islamist, became a reformist, and has called for a democratic transition since 2023.

Nancy A. Youssef and Vivian Salama: Why the U.S. hasn’t yet struck Iran

“These two men matter symbolically, as two ends of a spectrum, the two sides of the 1979 revolution,” Ganjbakhsh told me. “But the coalition can also include everybody in between. Without losing our historical identities, we can join up together.” Even Mansouri and her colleagues in the Iranian Reformist Front could be part of this, Ganjbakhsh suggested, given that they have shown sympathy for the protesters and have paid for it with the charges against them.

The arrests of domestic political figures coincided with sensitive diplomatic talks between Iran and the United States. Hard-liners may have worried that a deal would change the balance of factional forces inside the regime, and so sought to shore up their internal position by arresting their rivals. Mahmoud Sadeghi, a reformist former member of Parliament, went so far as to call the arrests a “pseudo-coup” in a post on X.

Surely Iran’s domestic and exiled opposition would rather participate in shaping the country’s fate than have it decided between the regime, with its many factions, and Iran’s foreign adversaries. But if the opposition is to play any role, it will have to get its act together and unite.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has faced intense scrutiny from Republicans and calls for her firing from Democrats since the January 24 shooting of Alex Pretti by Customs and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Now Noem’s tenuous standing with the Trump White House is creating concern in her home state of South Dakota that she might leave the Cabinet to challenge Senator Mike Rounds in the state’s June Republican primary.

Political allies of Rounds have begun preparing for this scenario, even though they remain skeptical that Noem will actually make the move, three people familiar with the discussions told me. To get into the race, Noem would have to register for the primary and collect the 2,171 supportive signatures statewide by the end of next month. A Noem adviser told me today that she has no plans to leave. But Noem could have an incentive to seek elective office if Democrats remain on track to win back control of the House and launch investigations into her tenure at the Department of Homeland Security. A Senate seat would give her both a professional staff and a fundraising platform to help defend herself.

“It’s something people are talking about across the state,” one Republican involved in South Dakota’s politics told me; this person, like others I spoke with, requested anonymity to discuss the rumors. “And based on everything I’ve been hearing, Mike Rounds would handily win that race.”

In recent weeks, Noem has ceded some of her public-leadership role overseeing immigration-enforcement operations, and President Trump has relied more on the White House “border czar” Tom Homan to lead those efforts. White House officials have grown frustrated with her performance as Republican midterm strategists raise alarms about the political damage her deportation strategy is doing to the party’s chances. One person familiar with the discussions told me that Noem’s position in the Cabinet is no longer secure, even though the president has not yet moved against her and has repeatedly praised her in public comments.

Read: Battles are raging inside the Department of Homeland Security

The situation has been complicated by the refusal of congressional Democrats to vote for a new budget for Noem’s department, which has caused a partial government shutdown that is expected to last at least into next week. Republicans say that Democratic calls for Noem’s removal make Trump pushing her out in the immediate future less likely. In his second term, Trump has been deeply reluctant to allow political pressure to force him into firing Cabinet members.

Several weeks ago, before the Pretti shooting, Republicans in South Dakota learned that pollsters were asking voters whom they would prefer in a matchup between Rounds and Noem, two people familiar with the calls told me, adding that they don’t know who is paying for the polling and have not seen the results.

The possibility of Noem running against Rounds has also prompted discussion among advisers to the president about possibly waiting to make a change to DHS leadership until after next month’s filing deadline, according to one person familiar with the discussions. Others have been supportive of a move. “Mike Rounds is so unpopular amongst Republican primary voters, he’d lose to a dead dog,” a national Republican strategist told me. The senator’s allies pushed back against that characterization. Rounds, 71, has successfully run statewide as a Republican four times since 2014, serving two terms as governor before being elected twice to the Senate.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told me in a text message that it would not be appropriate for a government spokesperson to comment on a story about Noem’s political future. Another adviser to Noem told me that her team had not polled the race.

Rounds’s Senate office did not respond to a request for comment. The White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and America First cabinet and staff in history,” before listing off some of the administration’s accomplishments.

Rounds and Noem, both former governors of South Dakota, have never been particularly close and have occasionally clashed in public. After Noem published a book that describes her decision to kill her family dog after she determined that it was dangerous and untrainable, Rounds was notably outspoken in his criticism. “I don’t see how it helps,” he said of her description of the incident. “These dogs become a member of a family, you know. People identify with that.”

Trump and Rounds have also clashed, particularly over Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, which Rounds described as “fair”; Trump incorrectly maintains that he won the election. But Trump endorsed Rounds over the summer—“HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” the president posted on social media. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the senior senator from South Dakota, is a close ally of Rounds and would likely back him over Noem.

Another possible route for Noem is to run again for the U.S. House seat that she held from 2011 to 2019. That seat will be vacated next year by Representative Dusty Johnson, who has announced that he is running for governor. Noem has also expressed interest in the past about being selected as a running mate on a Republican ticket or mounting her own presidential campaign.</div>

They already said they had numerous other regulations to keep the tariffs going.

It was literally a rejection based on the stated reason for using the provision they did. They basically said &quot;this is the wrong form. you need to go back and get a different form&quot;.

This very late and half-assed decision confirms that the so-called supreme court is little more than a rubber stamp for the wanna-be dictator pedophile and his clique who have been the worst enemy of the United States ever. Alongside their stupid voters like yourself.

We were going to spend that much on debt over the next ~3 weeks anyway.

It&#39;s only $175BThat&#39;s about $500 per person in the United States. For many families, that&#39;s a big deal and would make a significant difference to them. It was taken through an illegal tax and should be returned to them.

In principle, I agree w/ the idea of tariffs.  I&#39;m not a &quot;free trade uber alles&quot; guy that most pre-2016 Republicans were, of the schools of Forbes, Kudlow, Limbaugh, Buckley, et al.  In the 90s, even though I was pro-GOP on other things, I agreed w/ Dick Gephardt and David Bonior on the need to have fair trade - something that was echoed in Corporate America by the likes of Lee Iacocca, Ross Perot and to an extent, even Trump.  All other nations have tariffs on foreign goods - regardless of whether they&#39;re

1) 30% of Trump&#39;s tariffs were ruled legal.

2) The administration has been given one year before the tariffs have to be rescinded.

serious practical consequences in the near term

So Kavanaugh&#39;s basically saying &quot;Even if the tariffs were illegal, they&#39;re so darned inconvenient to undo that the regime should get away with acting illegally.&quot;

I&#39;m sure the AI apologists will soon be flooding the comments with &quot;human coders make mistakes too&quot;, but if a human coder decided to &quot;delete and recreate the environment&quot; of a running system they would be fired before the end of the day.

The problem here is that developers can take responsibility for the action while AI can not.  Humans do make mistakes and that&#39;s ok; best practice is not to just can employees for messing up.  Once is a mistake.  Twice is an HR event.  When someone does something dumb we forgive but we also insist that meaningful steps are taken to prevent that problem in the future.  AI can&#39;t really take those steps because AI can&#39;t be accountable for &quot;don&#39;t do it again.&quot;  Taking down production because you dropped a table

No.  Bad Software engineer.  Bad software engineer.

To be fair, it&#39;s probably the CEO who asked that the chatbot has 777 access to everything.

  You mean the X-stein files?

By that you mean the one that&#39;s actually releasing documents?

Don&#39;t get me wrong: this took way too fucking long, the &#39;censoring&#39; part was necessary to try to protect victims but took too long AND was done completely incompetently.

And ultimately, I&#39;m pissed because nobody&#39;s IN FUCKING JAIL.  (Ghislane or her body-double excepted.)

So yeah, lots and lots wrong with the process but let&#39;s not let our TDS prevent remembering that Biden *also* had all these documents but he was uninterested in releasing them at al

Isn&#39;t that what the Epstein files were all about? Beings so rich and powerful they don&#39;t exhibit typical human behaviors. I&#39;m sure there was probing involved.

A religion takes a collection of sacred writings as its inerrant source of facts. Science doesn&#39;t do that.

Science takes observations as facts, and builds testable, falsifiable models, theories, or laws from them. Whether a model, theory, or law survives depends on whether it can make accurate predictions or explanations of other observations. If it can&#39;t, then it is discarded. No faith or belief involved.

Now, scientists do form hunches and opinions, including on whether extraterrestrial life exists. They may engage in arguments about what contitutes possible evidence for it, and debate how and where such life could be found. But scientists are hard to convince, especially about something as extraordinary as the detection of extraterrestrial life. What would it take to convince them? As Carl Sagan said, &quot;Extraordinary claims demand extraordianry evidence.&quot; Scientists would temper their conviction of something by the strength or weakness of the evidence. They wouldn&#39;t just take something on &quot;faith.&quot;

That said, there are many scientists who are religious. But they don&#39;t apply religious thinking when they&#39;re in their labs. They save that for their churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and so on. They can keep those two parts of their lives separated.

And I give psychology a break here. Statistical variance in their data is typically much larger than in the physical sciences. The work psychologists do is worth doing, even though they cannot arrive at conclusions that are as precise. But they are still governed by evidence, just like other scientists.

&quot;Overall evolution is running out of explanation for the ever larger facts that are challenging its claims. The most obvious of these are the irreducible complexity of many biological mechanisms that make their spontaneous emergence an unreasonably unlikely event; a lot of the time the evolutionist position comes down to: &#39;of course it must have been evolution because I refuse to consider the alternative&#39;. THAT is a faith statement ;)&quot;

Ah, yet another variation on: gee, everything is sooooo complex, I don&#39;t understand it, therefore God. Grow up, grasshopper. There is no credible alternative to &quot;evolution&quot;. God is not a credible alternative. Ever see him? Has he ever said squat to you? Can we test him for observations? No, no, and no.

&quot;the irreducible complexity of many biological mechanisms that make their spontaneous emergence an unreasonably unlikely event;&quot;

The irreducible complexity argument is right out of Intelligent Design, i.e., create a strawman and then declare him real. &quot;spontaneous emergence&quot;, yep, and you understand nothing about evolution if that is what you think. &quot;unreasonably unlikely event&quot;, Oh? So it is unfathomable to you so it must not have happened?

Try this, go to your bank and demand money because you cannot understand why they just don&#39;t just hand you a bag of it.

God is not a credible alternative. Ever see him? Has he ever said squat to you? Can we test him for observations? No, no, and no.Unfortunately a lot of people think he speaks directly to them. I only can&#39;t decide whether the biggest wingnuts are the ones who think they literally hear him or the ones who say shit like &quot;I know god exists because my team won the fancy bucket&quot;

&quot;I know god exists because my team won the fancy bucket&quot;No It was actually pee [youtube.com].

&quot;I know god exists because my team won the fancy bucket&quot;

&quot;The most obvious of these are the irreducible complexity...&quot;You&#39;re running out of places to hide.

A lot of people are mocking you, and for good reason; however, I would like to ask you in good faith, &quot;What is the irreducible complexity&quot; you speak of? Is it how individual cells come together to work as a whole? Is it even higher level than individual cells, like the eye? Where is this irreducible complexity&quot;?

The reason why people are mocking you is because despite our collective desire to believe that God did it, we have found zero evidence pointing in that direction. That doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;God did it&quot;

other major religions are far less sacred writing oriented

Replace the word &quot;writings&quot; with &quot;dogma&quot; and his post says the same thing as before, except without the nit you&#39;re picking.

BTW, the fact that nobody has found any facts at all (I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you were unable to mention a single one) which challenge evolution after over 150 years of some people really looking hard, is why it has been such an enduring theory. It&#39;s not 1860 anymore, and we&#39;ve become a lot more certain (it&#39;s all a matter

A “church” in America, has been reduced to mean that place where tax evaders go to get corruptly rich and pretend it’s not a sin by abusing “religion” by any means necessary.  See Scientology’s path from science fiction to tax-free enlightenment as painful evidence.

&quot;...tax evaders go to get corruptly rich ...&quot;Yes of course, but religion didn&#39;t start with that, tax laws were devised to accommodate religion and make it possible.  Religion has always been about exploiting people for wealth and power, tax evasion is just an invention to that end. Nevertheless, that is what a church in America is, for the most part.

The way ministers are compensated is appalling, it is difficult to imagine how any decent human being could consider it acceptable.

Science doesn&#39;t do that.Science takes observations as facts, and builds testable, falsifiable models, theories, or laws from them....and then takes all those factual results and runs it through the religion of politics, to ensure whatever sacred (most profitable/beneficial) outcome the  sponsors want to see, comes to fruition.Yes.  We know scientists should know better.  That’s what makes this worse.  We should have not allowed the infection of the religion of politics to infect science.

&quot;If science doesn’t push back more on the profit motive, it will be viewed as a religion. Because it is.&quot;

This is your failure, it is caused by you misattributing corruption to science.  Science is a process, it is not corrupt, people are corrupt.

If science doesn’t push back more on the profit motiveScience (especially the field you are talking about) is one of the worst paid and underfunded areas of education and advancement. If there was any profit motive at play here people wouldn&#39;t be studying this stuff.Now there is a profit motive somewhere, it is the group asking you for donations on Sunday morning from with a building owned by a group with an incalculably high net worth given their assets all over the world from which they spread their good word.

While that&#39;s how it is supposed to work, you do have to be careful with people abusing science for their own ends.

The classic example is scientific racism. It started centuries ago, as a way to justify slavery by &quot;scientifically&quot; proving that white people were superior and black people were simply meant to be dominated and controlled. More recently we have had things like The Bell Curve, which was arguing that some races are more intelligent than others, based on obviously flawed but &quot;scientific&quot; methodolog

&quot;No faith or belief involved.&quot;Science is a process practiced by humans, belief is definitely involved.  Humans are flawed, if they weren&#39;t &quot;science&quot; wouldn&#39;t exist in the vocabulary, everything would conform to scientific ideals. Science itself is predicated on &quot;belief&quot; being involved and science benefits from it while compensating for its weakness. You cannot separate the process from those doing it.

&quot;Now, scientists do form hunches and opinions,...&quot;Right, because belief is involved.

&quot;...but this wouldn&#39;t pass as scientific evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life under any other lens.&quot;It would pass as evidence of &quot;possible existence&quot; though.  That&#39;s more than religion has.  And faith doesn&#39;t have &quot;positions&quot;, faith is feeling; faith isn&#39;t defined by a &quot;lack of sufficient evidence&quot;, it is defined as belief outside of consideration of evidence.  There can be both faith and evidence, it&#39;s only in religious contexts where that&#39;s consistently not true.

With the arrest of ex-Prince Andrew, Trump is getting even more nervous and trying to deflect attention from the Epstein files.

And here&#39;s an actual conspiracy to smear others as engaging in conspiracy theories.  Project 2025 is real, the current administration is a &quot;bunch of nazis&quot;,  Trump is paid by Putin and assisted by Putin,  Russia is not fighting Nazis in Ukraine AND there is credible evidence that Trump has &quot;fucked kids&quot;.

&quot;What can you do?&quot;Only how much you are paid to post your bullshit.

According to people like you, project 2025 was just a fake/nothing serious/nothing that Trump planned to implement. Now your tune has changed to it not being &quot;a conspiracy to take all our money and get us all poor like yourself&quot;. I wonder what will be your next iteration.

Sadly I doubt that the Andrew thing will go very far. He might get a slap on the wrist. They are only looking at if he gave Epstein sensitive information as part of his job as ambassador. While it seems likely that he gave out the information in exchange for access to girls to rape, or because Epstein was blackmailing him, the chances of anything that harms Trump coming out of this are low.

&quot;Quick! Look! Aliens are real and Obama broke the law for saying so! Just stop looking at the Epstein files!&quot; - The US Pedophile in Chief

The theory is that he&#39;s willing to protect the democrats in the files if it helps him and his cronies in getting away too.But the very obviously selecting redacting of the files still speaks volumes about how the government is trying to shift the focus to anyone but their friends.Like how Bill Barr, who closed the Epstein &quot;suicide&quot; investigation within days, is starting to pop up in documents at an alarming rate... For every democrat-aligned person in there, there&#39;s a dozen Repubs.

Just release it all. Nail everyone who&#39;s implicated in wrongdoing. Stop trying to distract from what is a way bigger scandal than Watergate.

The difference is that ordinary people, and Democrats, are just fine with criminals going down, we believe in justice and the rule of law.  Republicans don&#39;t, for them it&#39;s the law of the jungle so long as they have the guns.

LOL going for the quantity paycheck.  Better grab that money before Russia goes bankrupt.  As Ben Shapiro, the money dries up eventually.

Biden didn&#39;t interfere with the DOJ, that&#39;s Trump&#39;s thing.  Biden had respect for the country.  Garland was Biden&#39;s clearest failure, a better choice would have seen the worst criminal of our lifetimes prosecuted rather than reelected.

There are some very clear things here though, Trump is definitely covering up the Epstein information, so if it is &quot;democrats&quot; that are being protected then Trump must be a &quot;democrat&quot; lover.  Shouldn&#39;t that be enough to get rid of him?  Or do you forget the moment the subject

Biden didn&#39;t interfere with the DOJ, that&#39;s Trump&#39;s thing. If we make it through Trump&#39;s presidency without a world war I will consider that a success.

&quot;Three, every sick pedo-loving devil worshipper is doing the same media manipulation that allowed them to get away with it for so long.&quot;So, Trump.  Of that everyone can agree.

&quot;Your ignorance is becoming worse than the fucking crime, no thanks to your long-TDS infection.&quot;TDS is believing that raping children is not bad when Trump is doing it.  You&#39;re so close.

If we really want Trump to stop trashing America to distract us from his pedophilia, then I have a modest proposal which should solve this. I hope oldschool conservative Republicans will listen to me, because they&#39;re going to be the hardest to persuade. Fortunately the far-left (i.e. MAGA) Republican majority has already embraced and endorsed what I&#39;m about to say, so I&#39;m hoping the caucus can unify toward them instead of toward the conservatives. (But I still think conservative support would be good; you n

Will they send SPICE (Space ICE) after them?

Whatever you suspect his motives to be at any given time... yeah. That&#39;s exactly what they are. Want to take the heat off one conspiracy? Throw the red meat of another to those same wolves. There&#39;s no subtlety or nuance to the mechanism. No deft sleight of hand or misdirection. Like his &quot; I know you are but what am I?&quot; approach, or the reliable way he accuses others of doing exactly what he is guilty of, the man&#39;s actions and defenses come straight out of the schoolyard.

It&#39;s actually one of his more endearing qualities - a kind of backhanded honesty in a way.

By himself, Trump is that simple. With people like Vought around him stroking him and pushing him in certain directions by repeating words until they stick in his demented brain, he can wind up doing things with lasting effects.

The key letter in UFO is U. Whoever saw it or took a picture of it etc cannot identify it and doesn&#39;t know what it is.That&#39;s also why you only see blurry photos, because if the photo was clear it wouldn&#39;t be an unidentified object anymore - you would know what it was, it would be something benign and the case would be closed.

No UNDISPUTABLE AND DEFINITIVE PROOF of intelligent alien life will emerge in the next 12 months.

If aliens do land on earth, ICE will capture them and place them in containment. They will learn Spanish. They will hate Trump. Shit, this could be a Netflix movie. Never mind.

Try District 9 (2009).  It uses aliens instead of people as an allegory for South African apartheid.

For something American but a bit older, you can look at Alien Nation (1988) or the television series that followed.

It was Trump&#39;s pal Tony Blair who once said: populists don&#39;t, on the whole, invent grievances. They exploit them.

So, towards which clear and unambiguous interpretation do you lean?

Don&#39;t think about that. Look at this. Aliens!

in a free and open society. That we have governments and corporations that cannot tell the truth tells us they are completely unethical. If they were doing good, they&#39;d be showing off but since they&#39;re ashamed, they hide their actions. This is exactly what classism and crime looks likes

Yes, Trump and his supporters have very limited memories.

The content of the Epstein files must be pretty bad for Trump, considering how much work he is putting into not releasing them despite a law to do so. In July 2025 Seth Meyers claimed:  We’re just one Epstein story away from Trump announcing that UFOs are real [theguardian.com], and it looks he&#39;s going down that path now.

He&#39;s doing an outstanding job of gaslighting Democrats into immolating themselves. Larry Summers, gone. Bill Gates, gone, Obama&#39;s chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, gone.

&quot;Hyatt executive chair Tom Pritzker steps down over Jeffrey Epstein ties&quot; That&#39;s the brother of the Democratic governor of Illinois.

Then of course we have Andrew, (meme of the week, Get under the bus  Andrew) and the Norwegian royal family isn&#39;t looking any better.

The Democrats have the problem and are projecting like mad trying to avoid facin

You might need to rethink your class biases.

&quot;Aliens are real&quot; is a completely different statement than &quot;we have contact with aliens&quot;.

The first is a deduction. Given the size of the universe, it is incredibly unlikely that we are the only life in the universe.

Only the 2nd would be a bomb shell. And he didn&#39;t say that.

What was the outcome? Did anything at all happen that might penalize the firms involved, or might dissuade PE firms from future irresponsible actions like this?

Nope. What I see here is some PE firms made bank. I see a working example business process for other PE firms going forward.

The market punished them.  Major customers have dumped the product.

Investors will lose money as the value of the company probably continues to decline, they have destroyed the brand.

It takes two to tagno.  Someone has to lend these companies the money in order for them to be loaded with debt.  Eventually these parties will learn to sniff out bad credit risk, at someone point no matter how rosy the proposal and outlook is lenders are going to start looking at the history of these PE firms and say you know what - nope.

The poor architectural decisions and lack of care when fixing vulnerabilities goes way back, before PE got involved, it seems. Fortinet decided that &quot;encrypting&quot; their appliance filesystem to obstruct researchers was a better use of their time than actually trying to *design* a secure architecture for their systems. Of course, it was a pointless waste of time, because the appliance decrypts itself during boot, so the keys are available.

And PE is absolutely a terrible model for any software with a security aspect. They will always strip maintenance to the bone and PE backwater shops don&#39;t exactly have the best and brightest banging on their doors anyway.

&quot;The move is a blow to Waymo and other robotaxi companies who saw New York, and especially New York City, as a potential goldmine.&quot;TFA is missing a major point. The biggest blow is to New Yorkers. It&#39;s a potential gold mine because there are millions of registered voters who might prefer a robotaxi to the existing alternatives. Just sayin&#39; Kathy.Note the &quot;might&quot;. We don&#39;t know for sure and we won&#39;t until someone tries it. Given how popular robotaxis are everywhere else they&#39;ve been rolled out, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a huge question. But this argument hasn&#39;t stopped hostility to ride or house sharing either so I doubt it will now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

This week the Environmental Protection Agency took the momentous—and disastrous—step of repealing the government’s “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases “harm public health or welfare,” which is a prerequisite for regulating these pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The text of the Clean Air Act and robust congressional debates at the time of its enactment bely EPA’s central justification for repealing the endangerment finding and the greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles—that the Clean Air Act of 1970 was concerned only with local and regional pollutants. It wasn’t. But EPA’s repeal contains even more flaws. In particular, the agency relies on three key Supreme Court climate change cases to support its action but mischaracterizes each of them.

Most significantly, EPA mangles Massachusetts v. EPA, the 2007 case in which the Supreme Court decided that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” for the purposes of the Clean Air Act. According to EPA, that case involved an interpretation of the statute’s general definition of “air pollutant” and was not a decision specific to the law’s section 202(a)(1), which governs the regulation of motor-vehicle emissions. Thus, EPA contends that “Massachusetts did not consider or have reason to interpret the scope of the EPA’s authority” under the portion of the Clean Air act releveant to vehicle emissions.

This proposition is flatly wrong. Indeed, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide a specific question: “Whether the EPA Administrator has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other air pollutants associated with climate change under section 202(a)(1).” In its opinion, the court reiterated this question: “The first question is whether §202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’” And in the next sentence the Supreme Court provided the answer: “We have little trouble concluding that it does.”

EPA would be wrong even in the absence of this explicit language in the opinion. Its revisionist reading of Massachusetts also conflicts with that bedrock principle that a case holding is the narrowest principle necessary to resolve the controversy. And that principle is that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” that may be regulated under section 202(a)(1). EPA’s suggestion that the Supreme Court decided the broader question but not the narrower 202(a)(1) question turns basic legal reasoning on its head.

EPA’s mischaracterization of Supreme Court caselaw is not confined to Massachusetts v. EPA. The agency also provides a grievously misleading account of the 2014 Supreme Court opinion in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case has four key components. First, the Supreme Court held that EPA lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. Second, however, it also held that the agency had the authority to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of other sources. Third, as a result of these two holdings, as Justice Antonin Scalia noted in announcing the court’s opinion, EPA could regulate the vast majority of the emissions—over 90 percent—that were at stake in the case. And, fourth, Justice Scalia’s majority opinion reaffirmed the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, which it described as “’authoriz[ing] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles’” if the agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’”

Yet, in its repeal of the endangerment finding, EPA repeatedly refers to the first component of this decision to cast doubt on its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the agency never mentions the remaining three components, which are significantly more important and which paint a very different picture.

Similarly, EPA misconstrues the core holding of West Virginia v. EPA, decided in 2022, which struck down certain EPA greenhouse gas emission standards for power plants. The problem that the court identified was that the regulation was premised on the requirement of a specified proportion of “generation shifting” from dirtier power sources to clean ones: from coal to natural gas and from coal and natural gas to renewables. The court held that EPA did not have the authority to require such generation shifting in Clean Air Act power-sector standards. But the court recognized that “there is an obvious difference between (1) issuing a rule that may end up causing an incidental loss of coal’s market share, and (2) simply announcing what the market share of coal, natural gas, wind, and solar must be, and then requiring plants to reduce operations or subsidize their competitors to get there.” The court viewed the first category as an uncontroversial consequence of standard environmental regulation—indeed, it is a ubiquitous consequence of practically all regulation. Only the second category is impermissible for power-sector standards.

In its regulation of the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, which started in the Obama administration, EPA has never required a specific market shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles. These regulations are therefore conceptually different from the one struck down in West Virginia v. EPA. Also, in EPA’s earlier vehicle regulations for greenhouse gases, the market shift that resulted from the regulation was minor and clearly “incidental,” since manufacturers primarily met the regulatory standard by making their internal combustion vehicles more efficient. And, even if a court were to find that the Biden administration’s later standards were impermissibly premised on large market shift toward EVs, the proper remedy would be to strike down those standards, not to eliminate EPA’s ability to put in place any greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles, including ones that did not have this feature.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA Administrator, repeatedly says that his primary concern is with following the law. His characterization of the key Supreme Court cases on EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases tells a very different story.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

On Jan. 26, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz prohibited ICE from moving an immigrant, Baljinder Kumar, out of New Jersey while he challenged his unlawful detention. Five days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flagrantly defied that order, transferring Kumar to a detention center in … Texas. After his lawyers complained, federal officials returned Kumar to New Jersey. But Farbiarz was not inclined to let this disobedience go unpunished. He informed the New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office that he sought to craft a “remedy” for ICE’s defiance—and would require an “investigation” to assist him. He then ordered the office to investigate itself and to “enumerate each instance” in which it had “violated an order issued by a judge of this district” since Dec. 5.

Last Friday, Jordan Fox—an associate deputy attorney general and special attorney assigned to New Jersey—gave Farbiarz an answer: The office had violated at least 56 court orders since December alone, all related to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy mandating the indefinite detention of noncitizens legally entitled to a bond hearing. This confession, first reported by Politico’s Kyle Cheney, was accompanied by a letter stating that “we regret deeply all violations” but insisting that they were “unintentional and immediately rectified once we learned of them.” Fox, who is helping lead the New Jersey office after courts ousted Donald Trump’s first choice, Alina Habba, depicted these transgressions as relatively minor and rare. But Farbiarz did not buy it, noting that Kumar’s illegal transfer to Texas was far from an “outlier.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this court-ordered investigation, its startling conclusions, and the possible consequences. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I guess I have to give credit where it’s due. Jordan Fox took one for the team and laid out, chapter and verse, all the court orders this office had violated.

Mark Joseph Stern: Sort of. Fox actually excluded two categories of violations, missed status update deadlines and late docket notifications. When you include those, it’s 75 violations. So let’s dig into these numbers. At least 17 times, the government transferred a noncitizen to a different detention facility after a court unambiguously prohibited it from doing so. That means they were detained in another state, where it would be harder to reach their lawyers, and perhaps where judges are more inclined to rule for the government. At least 10 times, the U.S. attorney’s office failed to produce evidence ordered by the court. And at least one time, the government deported a noncitizen in direct contravention of a court order forbidding that deportation.

In some ways, this is a bigger deal than the ICE lawyer’s meltdown in court a few weeks ago. We now have the U.S. attorney’s office not going rogue here, but admitting under oath that it has breached court orders more than 50 times. And there were often dire consequences for the people whose rights were violated. Fox tried to paint this as a few errors around the edges, but to me it depicts a complete breakdown of the system. And it shows that if you sign up for this work—if you agree to work in a U.S. attorney’s office—you now know you will be violating court orders, maybe on the daily. Everybody is on notice: If you are assigned to handle these cases, you will violate court orders, and you may be held in contempt.

I’m old enough to remember Judge James Boasberg trying to ascertain whether his court order around the rendition flights to CECOT prison was flouted, and the lies and deceit that went into gaslighting him about that. And he’s still trying to get to the bottom of it! We talked about that story obsessively last spring. A year later, defiance of court orders doesn’t capture two weeks of a news cycle. We just say: Yeah, they do that now. They don’t care what judges think anymore. The American public has somehow normalized this.

All I can say is bless Boasberg for continuing to push that contempt case. I am glad to hear the rising chorus of other judges doing the same. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress say they want to impeach judges who hold Trump administration officials in contempt. Maybe this could be a Spartacus moment where you can’t impeach them all?

That takes us back to Minnesota, where Judge Laura Provinzino found Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Isihara in civil contempt during a Wednesday hearing for violating a court order. She said she’d fine him $500 a day until the government complied. One interesting piece of this story is that Isihara is a JAG attorney who was conscripted to help with the flood of habeas petitions in response to the mass detention policy as prosecutors continue to flee the Justice Department. And even he said he couldn’t handle the caseload.

This story illustrates the mix of incompetence and malice that is defining the administration’s mass detention campaign. The government arrested this individual, Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, at his workplace in January—even though he had lived here since 2018 and has no criminal record or a final order of removal authorizing his deportation. ICE then hustled him to Texas. His lawyers still managed to persuade Provinzino to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his immediate release in Minnesota and the return of all confiscated property.

The government did neither. It released him in Texas, not Minnesota, and withheld all of his property, including his driver’s license and other identification paperwork. So he was just dumped and abandoned. His lawyers had to go to Provinzino and tell her that her order had been flagrantly violated, which is when she scheduled the hearing. Soto Jimenez managed to make his way back from Texas, but as of Wednesday, ICE still hadn’t returned his identification cards. So Provinzino held Isihara, the JAG lawyer detailed to this case, in civil contempt until the cards were returned, with the $500 daily sanction. Fox 9 News reports that her order finally prompted the agency to mail back the ID cards. Which gives us the answer to the question we’ve been asking: What will it take to make ICE comply with the law? The answer is dragging JAGs into your courtroom and holding them in contempt.

The caseload is impossible. Nobody can do this volume of work. If you are a government lawyer thinking, Step aside, Mr. Isihara, because I can do this better next time, just know you’re being set up to pay $500 a day for the privilege.

            <h2>Quebec vehicles agency spent C$245M over budget on SAP ERP it wasn't sure it needed</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/saaq_sap_overrun/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A judge-led commission in Quebec has found that the state agency responsible for driver&#39;s licenses and license plates misled the Canadian government about a troubled SAP ERP project that ran more than C$245 million ($179 million/ £132.6 million) over budget.

The report into the disastrous nine-year project – which went live three years later than first predicted – also reveals that Société de l&#39;Assurance Automobile du Québec (SAAQ) did not know whether ERP was the appropriate technology for its digital transformation program and the launch of an online processing service called SAAQclic.

During the early planning process in late 2014, the project&#39;s management relied heavily on SAP to understand if it needed an ERP suite to achieve its goals in digital transformation, the report said. SAP at the time was preparing to bet its future on S/4HANA – its flagship ERP product – which SAAQ ended up adopting.

The report, tabled by Judge Denis Gallant, said the level of ties between project planners and SAP during the pre-tendering stage was surprising. It found evidence that SAP had a privileged place with SAAQ&#39;s staff and provided information on the operation of its systems before the launch of competition, in which Microsoft, Infor, and Oracle would participate.

A spokesperson for SAP said: &quot;SAP has cooperated fully with Quebec&#39;s Gallant Commission in its investigation of the 2017 procurement and implementation project run by the Société de l&#39;Assurance Automobile du Québec (SAAQ).

&quot;SAP is committed to the highest standards of ethics and compliance in all the markets in which it operates, and maintains a robust compliance management system to ensure that the company is compliant with all laws and regulations, providing assurance of integrity in all engagements with customers, partners and all stakeholders across the world.&quot;

The report says the internal project team carried out a matching process for ERP against SAAQ&#39;s needs across a range of project areas, and then combined the scores to reach a conclusion. The commission criticized the process for failing to consider how widely matching scores varied. For some areas, such as insurance, ERP scored highly – SAP has a tailored product in this industry. In other areas critical to SAAQ&#39;s main business – the public-facing issuing of driver&#39;s licenses and license plates – ERP did not score as well.

The project&#39;s directors approved the decision to buy an ERP product for the main technical solution for its digital transformation in February 2015. They said they made the decision after considering in-house custom development, a best-of-breed plus integration approach, and an ERP suite.

However, the commission said it could not find evidence of the project team&#39;s separate in-depth analysis of the three approaches. Following a competitive tender, SAP was selected as the main software supplier and LGS, a local IBM-owned company, together with Big Blue, was appointed the systems integrator.

The first phase of the project went reasonably smoothly, but during the second phase, the project ran into trouble, the report states. It dealt with processes at the heart of SAAQ&#39;s mission, including issuing driver&#39;s licences and vehicle registration certificates, and was expected to take two and a half years, from October 2017 to April 2020. It planned to go live with a front-end SAAQclic online system in January 2020.

The second phase was different from earlier work in that it required a high degree of customization to the ERP suite. The commission said this was the beginning of the project&#39;s financial troubles. The requirement for a highly customized solution was compounded by a number of other factors. In September 2019 – more than two years into the overall program – the project leaders decided to change the scope and include processes to support roadside enforcement and checking driver licenses. This work was awarded to the IBM/SAP alliance without outside competition.

The tech teams also found business rules they hoped to define in the ERP suite were more complex than expected, and poorly documented. From the outset, the team decided to adopt an agile methodology, in which the implementation begins before the design is finished. But because of the lack of documentation and unforeseen complexity, the approach led to a massive increase in the number of iterative sprints needed to get to a solution.

Lastly, the project was plagued by a shortage of skills and a high vacancy rate. The commission criticized SAAQ for its lack of preparation and SAP/IBM for underestimating the complexity of the work.

An IBM spokesperson said: &quot;We acknowledge the work undertaken by the Gallant Commission and are reviewing their findings carefully. Our engagement followed a thorough and rigorous procurement process, and we acted in good faith in accordance with the law, our contract, and applicable professional standards.&quot;

The program&#39;s budget for the build phase was C$375 million ($274 million/ £202 mllion) in July 2017. By September 2020, that had nearly doubled to C$682 million. Including support until 2027, the total cost was set to be C$968 million. The go-live of phase two was also pushed back to the spring of 2023. It did not go smoothly.

In November 2022, several witnesses working on the project said they had found the solution was not ready for deployment, the commission said. But instead of delaying the launch, the project&#39;s leadership sanctioned an additional payment to the SAP/IBM alliance, one it was only supposed to receive once the work was complete.

At the end of January, most of SAAQ&#39;s services and transactions were closed to the public until the system went live on February 16, 2023. It had prepared the publicity to introduce the new online system, SAAQclic.

On February 20, 2023, the SAAQclic portal opened for all customers. It was either unavailable or slow, the report states. Unable to process some transactions, independent merchants directed customers to the SAAQ offices. As the public tried to use the portal, they struggled to get it to work, and they also turned up in person. SAAQ&#39;s offices were left grappling with a new system and a deluge of people demanding services. A TV report showed large queues forming, and with other reports including angry customers venting their frustration by raising voices against staff, some of whom called the police. The police themselves were unable to access the system to perform roadside checks of vehicles and drivers&#39; licenses, resulting in unjustified arrests and detentions.

In March, the government intervened, with Minister of Transport Geneviève Guilbault signing three orders, including one temporarily suspending police tickets and fines for driving without a valid licence. In April 2023, auditors from PwC were brought in. They later concluded phase 2 did not meet its specifications. Two further payments of around $100 million were sanctioned to the alliance. The implementation program was ended in September 2023 as phase 2 was completed. In 2025, SAAQ formally decided to put an end to subsequent phases 2.5 and 3, even though they were included in the original budget.

In its early, pre-tender estimates, SAP said SAAQ&#39;s ERP system might cost a total of between C$141 million and C$163 million, including both internal and supplier costs. The project ended up costing around C$620 million, and delivered less than the original scope. Including ongoing support, it was C$1.1 billion.

The commission is highly critical of the project&#39;s leadership. Its report says they misled government officials about escalating costs and delays. Judge Gallant called for honesty in public projects, not least because even when they are failing, there is an opportunity to learn.

SAAQ may reflect on its decision to put an ERP system at the heart of its digital transformation. For now, it has a highly customized implementation of SAP S/4HANA, which future tech teams may need to maintain and one day upgrade or move away from. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/north_korean_it_worker_prison/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko will spend the next five years behind bars in the US for his involvement in helping North Korean IT workers secure fraudulent employment.

The 29-year-old played a role in supporting individuals working for a hostile regime to get contracts in the US.

In November 2025, Didenko pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, charges related to his website Upworksell.com, which allowed the North Korean techies assume identities stolen from US citizens and use them to secure employment.

North Korea&#39;s IT worker scheme has been running for years. It sees skilled workers illegally gain access to US jobs and salaries, which are used to fund Pyongyang&#39;s military.

Workers rely on being able to trick US companies into believing they are citizens by using resources such as identity providers like Didenko and laptop farms, which the Ukrainian also funded.

Laptop farms are exactly as they sound. Individuals in the US are paid to operate a series of laptops or PCs to which North Korean workers remotely connect and use to carry out their US job duties.

Using a laptop farm allows them to connect to company networks, seemingly as if from a US residence instead of a North Korean IP address. Government sanctions prevent North Koreans from working for US companies.

According to prosecutors, Didenko ran Upworksell between 2021 and May 2024, when the Justice Department seized the domain, diverting all traffic to servers controlled by the FBI. Polish police arrested him later that year, and he was extradited on December 31, 2024.

Didenko operated as many as 871 proxy identities during this time, official suspect, and he paid people in at least three residences across California, Tennessee, and Virginia to run laptop farms. He also helped these workers manage their salary payments through money services businesses so that they didn&#39;t have to open a US bank account.

Through Didenko&#39;s scheme, North Korean IT workers were able to get hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent salary payments. The Justice Department said much of this was falsely reported to the authorities in the names of those whose identities were stolen.

Didenko agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million in criminal proceeds as part of his sentence, which will be followed by 12 months of supervised release. He will also pay $46,547.28 in restitution to victims.

&quot;Defendant Didenko&#39;s scheme funneled money from Americans and US businesses, into the coffers of North Korea, a hostile regime,&quot; said US attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, announcing the sentencing.

&quot;Today, North Korea is not only a threat to the homeland from afar, it is an enemy within. By using stolen and fraudulent identities, North Korean actors are infiltrating American companies, stealing information, licensing, and data that is harmful to any business. But more than that, money paid to these so-called employees goes directly to munitions programs in North Korea.

&quot;We should be holding accountable to the fullest extent of the law the individuals, like Didenko, who are knowingly assisting North Koreans so that they can amass more weapons to harm the United States and peace in our world. This is not just a financial crime; it is a crime against national security.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture staff must demonstrate they have fully bought into the consultancy&#39;s AI vision if they want to get on.

A memo sent to senior staff this week, and reported in the FT, informed them that promotions to top roles at the corporation would necessitate &quot;regular adoption&quot; of AI tooling, and it is tracking uage.

In a statement to The Register, Accenture said:

&quot;Our strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work. That requires the adoption of the latest tools and technologies to serve our clients most effectively.&quot;

We asked a number of rival consultancies whether they were taking a similar approach to that of Accenture. So far neither their PRs nor their chatbots have come back to us.

However, consultancies, in common with other big businesses, have poured massive amounts of resources into AI. So, if staff were not &quot;encouraged&quot; to use them, those investments might look like a bit of a waste.

According to reports, McKinsey even asks potential recruits to use its own internal tool during assessments.

Accenture&#39;s AI lineup includes its AI Refinery Platform, developed with Nvidia – who else – and launched in 2024. At the time, chair and CEO Julie Sweet said:

&quot;AI Refinery will create opportunities for companies to reimagine their processes and operations, discover new ways of working, and scale AI solutions across the enterprise to help drive continuous change and create value.&quot;

In September, she reportedly warned that it would &quot;exit&quot; employees who did not embrace AI. Of course, there&#39;s also the prospect of staffers reimagining other ways to use AI, which also necessitates monitoring.

It emerged at the start of this week that KPMG had fined a senior staffer who used AI to ace an internal training course on, what else, AI. In fact, over two dozen Aussie staffers have been caught out using AI for internal exams.

Andrew Yates, CEO, KPMG Australia, said in a statement sent to The Reg:

&quot;As soon as we introduced monitoring for AI in internal testing in 2024, we found instances of people using AI outside our policy. We followed with a significant firmwide education campaign and have continued to introduce new technologies to block access to AI during testing.&quot;

He added: &quot;Monitoring and education around appropriate AI use are always on. Given the everyday use of these tools, some people breach our policy.  We take it seriously when they do. We are also looking at ways to strengthen our approach in the current self-reporting regime.&quot;

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Building a startup entirely on European infrastructure sounds like a nice sovereignty flex right up until you actually try it and realize the real price gets paid in time, tinkering, and slowly unlearning a decade of GitHub muscle memory.

That&#39;s the takeaway from a blog post published on Friday in which one founder lays out what happened when they decided to ditch the US hyperscalers and piece together a &quot;Made in EU&quot; stack instead.

The experiment eventually turned into hank.parts, a cross-border car parts marketplace where buyers post what they need and sellers from around Europe pitch offers.

The motivation won&#39;t surprise anyone who&#39;s followed the sovereignty debate: keep data in Europe, avoid putting everything in the hands of a few US cloud giants, and see if a homegrown stack can actually hold up. Turns out it can – just with a few more hurdles along the way.

Compute ended up running on Hetzner, with Scaleway filling in gaps like email and container registries. Bunny.net handled CDN and edge duties, Nebius provided GPU capacity for AI inference, and German identity outfit Hanko took care of authentication. A long tail of tools – analytics, secrets management, CRM, error tracking – was self-hosted on Kubernetes, with Rancher acting as the control tower.

&quot;Is self-hosting more work than SaaS? Obviously. But it means my data stays exactly where I put it, and I&#39;m not at the mercy of a provider&#39;s pricing changes or acquisition drama,&quot; the founder said.

The trade-off is that every self-hosted component becomes your responsibility when something breaks, and the documentation rabbit hole can get pretty deep at the worst possible moment.

What really stands out in the post isn&#39;t the infrastructure choices so much as the ecosystem&#39;s pull.

&quot;If you live in GitHub&#39;s ecosystem Actions, Issues, code review workflows, the social graph... walking away feels like leaving a city you&#39;ve lived in for a decade,&quot; they wrote. &quot;You know where everything is. Gitea is actually excellent, and I&#39;d recommend it without hesitation for the core git experience. But you&#39;ll miss the ecosystem.&quot;

Not everything can be local, though. Getting an app onto phones still means handing a cut to Apple and Google, and finding users still tends to run through Google Ads. Social logins also keep bouncing through US systems because that&#39;s what people expect. And if you want the newest AI models, you&#39;re still making a call across the Atlantic.

It doesn&#39;t come across as a warning so much as a reminder of where things stand. Europe&#39;s cloud scene is clearly capable, but going all-in today still means a bit more hands-on work and fewer shortcuts. You get more control and often lower bills, but with a little less of the &quot;it just works&quot; magic.

Europe can run your stack perfectly well. It just hasn&#39;t quite figured out how to make it the default path yet. ®

            <h2>Hard drives already sold out for this year – AI to blame</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/ai_blamed_again_as_hard_drives_sell_out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hard drive manufacturers have already sold all the units they will make this year, and it looks like the AI infrastructure boom is to blame, with hyperscalers soaking up all the high-capacity storage.

Seagate and Western Digital, two of the Big Three makers of rotating disk drives, confirmed during recent earnings conference calls that they have already flogged all of their manufacturing output.

Western Digital chief Tiang Yew Tan told analysts &quot;We&#39;re pretty much sold out for calendar &#39;26. We have firm purchase orders with our top seven customers. And we&#39;ve also established long term agreements with two of them for calendar year &#39;27 and one of them for calendar year &#39;28.&quot;

Seagate CEO Dave Mosley said on his own company’s call: &quot;Our nearline capacity is fully allocated through calendar year 2026, and we expect to begin accepting orders for the first half of calendar year 2027 in the coming months… additionally, multiple cloud customers are discussing their demand growth projections for calendar 2028, underscoring that supply assurance remains their highest priority.&quot;

Great for WD and Seagate. Not so much for eveveryone else.

It is understood that the third major disk producer, Toshiba, is likely to be in a similar situation. We asked the drive maker and will update if we get an answer.

Hard drives have pretty much been displaced from everyday PCs and laptops, but the makers continue to bump up their capacities, making them attractive for applications requiring large volumes of data storage at low cost – such as cloud storage and AI training. Western Digital recently announced it will ship 44 TB drives this year, for example, with a roadmap to 100 TB by 2029.

What are the implications for this impending shortage? &quot;In my view this means no meaningful open production remains for discretionary buyers except the hyperscalers,&quot; said Sid Nag, President and Chief Research Officer at Tekonyx.

&quot;I am guessing these include locked-in purchase agreements extending into 2027 and 2028 for certain customers including those building AI datacenters. So there should be no impact to that business. This also implies HDD manufacturing capacity is now almost exclusively prioritized for large AI/cloud players because of predictable, high-volume demand,&quot; Nag told us.

&quot;This will, however, impact the mid-size market who depend on server technology.&quot;

Omdia Senior Research Director for Enterprise Infrastructure Vlad Galabov agreed.

&quot;I think it will be a very tough year for the standard enterprise general purpose server and for enterprise storage. We have downgraded our forecast for those markets,&quot; Galabov told The Register.

Despite this, Omdia raised its overall 2026 server spend forecast to $590 billion and its datacenter capex forecast to more than $1 trillion because the top ten cloud providers keep upping their investment plans.

Corporate IT projects will likely take a hit if they were counting on using hard drives as a capacity tier in their storage plans, but there are already shortages of DRAM and NAND flash silicon, the latter used in solid state drives (SSDs) – all due to AI-driven demand putting a strain on supply chains.

&quot;We are seeing shortages of memory, storage and even CPU silicon and all of these will be dynamically affecting each other for some significant time based on announced capex spend and (datacenter) land leases,&quot; said IDC&#39;s senior research director for European Enterprise Infrastructure, Andrew Buss.

&quot;The growth of AI demands storage, and lots of it, and also networking to move the stored data around, so expect there to also be high-performance networking shortages as well going forwards. And with next-generation Rubin GPUs apparently needing 20TB+ of fast SSD storage capacity per GPU, this will become even more acute,&quot; Buss told us.

&quot;This has been consuming large amounts of fast flash-based NVMe SSDs, and the increase in price and shortage of media is now encouraging many who need storage to reconsider HDDs. We would expect hybrid flash arrays to have a resurgence, but also HDD only arrays where the traffic patterns are suitable,&quot; he added.

So it looks like it might be a bad year for a server refresh, unless you happen to be one of the hyperscalers, with shortages and price hikes affecting many components.

Omdia forecasts the top ten cloud service providers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, CoreWeave, ByteDance, xAI, Alibaba, and Tencent) to account for more than 70 percent of the server capex this year and AI-optimized servers for 80 percent of the total server spend. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Electronic Frontier Foundation says it will accept LLM generated code from contributors to its open source projects but will draw the line at non-human generated comments and documentation.

The venerable non-profit&#39;s Alexis Hancock and Samantha Baldwin laid out its policy this week, explaining: &quot;We strive to produce high quality software tools, rather than simply generating more lines of code in less time.&quot;

And while &quot;LLMs excel at producing code that looks mostly human generated&quot; they pair said these models often have &quot;underlying bugs that can be replicated at scale.&quot;

&quot;This makes LLM-generated code exhausting to review, especially with smaller, less resourced teams.&quot;

Or put another way, &quot;well intentioned people&quot; submit code with hallucinations, submissions, exaggeration or misrepresentation.

This means project maintainers can end up refactoring, not just reviewing code, when a contributor doesn&#39;t actually understand the code they’ve generated. And that’s when the code is actually useful.

The EFF is clearly worried about a tidal wave of AI generated code that is &quot;only marginally useful or potentially unreviewable.&quot;

So, it is asking contributors to &quot;please refrain from submissions that you haven&#39;t thoroughly understood, reviewed, and tested.&quot; Baldwin and Hancock want them to disclose when their contributions came courtesy of an LLM and insist that documentation and comments is &quot;human&quot; in origin.

&quot;Project leads can determine if submissions aren&#39;t reasonably reviewable.&quot;

OpenUK CEO Amanda Brock said the open source community was only now grasping the impact of AI-generated code on projects and maintainers.

&quot;It&#39;s a combination of the breadth of content that&#39;s scraped and number of bots doing it, and the volume of contributions and level of &#39;garbage in&#39; when we look at project contributions.&quot;

She predicted: &quot;We&#39;re gonna see a lot more AI red cards in the coming weeks.&quot;

The EFF currently has four projects on the boil, all under GNU or Creative Commons terms: Certbot; Privacy Badger; Boulder; and Rayhunter. Needless to say, they all have a privacy and security bent.

It&#39;s no surprise the EFF&#39;s policy change has a slightly world-weary tone. Hancock and Baldwin said &quot;It is worth mentioning that these tools raise privacy, censorship, ethical, and climatic concerns for many. These issues are largely a continuation of tech companies&#39; harmful practices that led us to this point.

&quot;We are once again in &#39;just trust us&#39; territory of Big Tech being obtuse about the power it wields,&quot; they added. ®

            <div id="article-text">Regulators noticed Polymarket and Kalshi rake in cash on sports bets. So now they’re cosplaying as the future of news.

Regulators noticed Polymarket and Kalshi rake in cash on sports bets. So now they’re cosplaying as the future of news.

Substack has updated its partnership with betting platform Polymarket, “introducing native tools that make it easier to share, discuss, and debate prediction market data directly on Substack.” Additionally, Polymarket will effectively pay “a cohort of creators,” including Matt Yglesias, to use its data though the newsletter platform’s pilot sponsorships program.

This is just the latest foray of prediction markets into media. Last week, Dow Jones agreed to incorporate Polymarket’s betting data into its “content,” including The Wall Street Journal. A month before that, CNN incorporated Kalshi’s betting odds. In December, CNBC agreed to infuse its programming with Kalshi data. Noted poker player Nate Silver, once a respected stats journalist, is now an advisor for Polymarket.

“If you get the news before it happens, that should be even more economically valuable.”

This looks like a concerted effort to confuse people about what news is and does. Here’s Robinhood’s CEO Vlad Tenev, one of the leading profiteers from America’s financial nihilism: “I like to think about prediction markets as the next generation of the news. We know the news is economically valuable. People pay for getting the newspaper; they pay indirectly for shows like this [Squawk on the Street on CNBC] through advertising, and so if you get the news before it happens, that should be even more economically valuable.”

Let’s stop for a moment and think about what news is, since the slippage in Tenev’s quote (“if you get the news before it happens”) highlights the problem with his line of thought. It kind of seems like people have recently become confused about the difference between information, journalism, and “content.” The earliest known predecessor to journalism is Rome’s Acta Diurna, which was in circulation more than two millennia ago — basically an official record of events, such as births, new laws, and financial data. (A similar publication circulated in China starting in the Tang dynasty.) In 15th-century Europe, businessmen began disseminating written accounts of important events to their contacts; this is essentially the predecessor to the modern newspaper.

Do you notice anything here? That’s right: News is a record of things that have happened. Weather forecasts and horoscopes aside, newspapers do not traffic in predictions. They tell you, instead, about the very recent past — what happened yesterday. An online news site, not constrained by a printing press, can even tell you what happened 20 minutes ago. But no news organization exists to predict the future. By definition, you cannot know the news before it happens.

The actual function of news, however, can sometimes be obscured by what Daniel J. Boorstin calls “pseudo-events,” which are planned events that can be repeated, such as awards shows, press conferences, political conventions, and earnings calls. Unlike true events — natural disasters, a vote at the city council meeting, an assassination — the outcome of a pseudo-event can be known in advance because it is planned. Its contents can be distributed to reporters “under embargo,” so that when the pseudo-event occurs, reporters can instantaneously run a story.

The conflation of betting markets and news began with political coverage

Lots of publications, including this one, include coverage of pseudo-events — an Apple event is a great example — alongside the accounting of real events. In Boorstin’s The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, he suggests that news outlets cover pseudo-events in part because there are not enough actual events to fill out the news cycle. There is also tremendous consumer demand for pseudo-events; celebrities, which are pseudo-events made flesh, are so significantly popular that an entire ecosystem of publications exists for them.

Pseudo-events have overtaken actual events in Hollywood, where they have long been generated to create marketing for movies. The other place where pseudo-events dominate real events is politics. Speeches are pseudo-events, which is why journalists often receive the drafted remarks in advance; so are press conferences, social media beefs, ribbon-cuttings, and the Presidential pardoning of a turkey. I bring this up because I believe the conflation of betting markets and news began with political coverage.

In 2024, no one was sure how reliable presidential polling was — since people were increasingly using mobile phones rather than landlines, and often not picking up because of a deluge of spam calls. Polls, of course, look more like pseudo-events (press releases) than actual ones (six-car pileups), and exist in part to drive conversation. They are not the same thing as news; polls are, at best, a snapshot of a specific group at a specific time asked specifically -worded questions and, at worst, political horoscopes. I’m not convinced newspapers should be in the business of reporting on polls, much less running them.

Still, people — at least editors and reporters, and maybe the audience too — wanted some indication of what might happen in a presidential election. Prediction markets were so confident that Trump would beat Harris that they made traditional newspapers, which saw the race as a toss up, look like they were waffling. (And if you don’t really understand how probability works, you too probably think Polymarket was more correct than “tossup.”) So betting markets were suggested as a viable alternative to polls; the idea was that people were so confident in a specific outcome that they were willing to wager on it. And that’s how odds on Polymarket and Kalshi started to creep into stories.

“​​These markets have changed the way people consume news.”

The other argument in favor of betting markets, as made by their advocates, is that they contain insider information. This is “cool,” according to Polymarket’s CEO, Shayne Coplan. It is also illegal. That doesn’t matter much to the purveyors of gambling-addiction-as-a-service; because contracts are peer-to-peer, the house isn’t getting ripped off. It’s only the punters dumb enough to enter the bet without insider information who’ll lose their shirts.

There are several examples of plausible insider trading on predictions markets: the entity who cashed out with almost half a million dollars when the US snatched Venezuela’s president, for instance — an actual event that occurred in order to create pseudo-events. (Baudrillard would be so proud!) Or the bettor who made more than $1 million by placing bets on what Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings would be. Or the trader who made $50,000 by betting correctly on the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

A great deal of volume in prediction markets is sports betting, though predictions markets mechanically work slightly differently than straight sports bets. A standard sports bet has the punter taking one side and the house taking the other; in prediction markets, there are punters on both ends, and the house just takes a cut of the trade. Also, prediction markets deal in contracts, which can lead to ambiguity — such as whether Cardi B’s dance during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show counted as a performance. It is possible for the spirit of a contract to be fulfilled (the US kidnapped the president of Venezuela) while the letter isn’t (according to Polymarket, this was not an “invasion”).

It is unclear to me how helping gambling companies rip off your audience serves the public interest

This distinction, silly as it sounds, may actually matter. While some states have indicated they believe prediction markets should follow the legal framework for sports betting, the feds think those states should fuck right off. Any moves by the states to limit insider trading on betting markets will be blocked by Mike Selig, the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “​​These markets have changed the way people consume news,” Selig says, accurately.

Obviously, as the Year in Search and Nobel Prize bets show, it’s easier to correctly bet on a pseudo-event than an actual one. But the consequences of insider information on actual information are potentially more devastating — the leakage of state secrets, and not to protect the public. As media critic Matt Pearce points out, there’s a problem of incentives: ethical journalists cannot pay sources, but prediction markets do.

Of course, for the insiders to make their money, there must be a steady supply of suckers. And there is! Only about a third of traders actually make profits, and “a large number of traders systematically lose money to a small minority of skilled participants.”

So by partnering with these betting markets, news organizations — from the legacy entities like WSJ or CNN to the burgeoning new media platforms like Substack — have undercut themselves two ways: first, by commodifying information and then by effectively endorsing competitors who can pay for that information; and second, by serving as advertising for prediction markets, making their audience vulnerable to getting ripped off by insiders. It is unclear to me how helping gambling companies rip off your audience serves the public interest, which is, or at least once was, the point of newsgathering.

A cynic might suggest that the move to embed betting markets in newsrooms is mere marketing

And the public interest is why most of us got into this business in the first place. Most journalists aim to reflect reality back to readers, without any particular interest in whether that makes said reader wealthier. The Fourth Estate, as news organizations are sometimes called, is meant to wield political power by uncovering wrongdoing, embarrassing the government into action. From Enron to Theranos, multiple frauds were first uncovered not by the SEC, but by the press. Back when corruption mattered in politics, many of those scandals — from Watergate to whatever we want to call George Santos’ whole deal — were also discovered by journalists rather than the Department of Justice.

This is not to say that reporters are always right, or that journalism always achieves its highest calling. I am, after all, old enough to remember the non-existent “weapons of mass destruction” that The New York Times reported on to justify the war in Iraq. But as suggested by my catty little remark about the WMDs, journalists are expected to be accountable for their mistakes. Any reputable newspaper or magazine runs a correction when even a word is off. (That NYT refuses to admit to its major errors is a longstanding area of consternation among other journalists.)

Prediction markets, on the other hand, make their money through transaction fees — and thus through volume. In true nihilistic fashion, these markets care less about the outcome of a contract than an actual casino. It is possible to feel betrayed by the various failures of mainstream media, but Kalshi, Polymarket, and Robinhood are only after your money. A cynic might suggest that the move to embed betting markets in newsrooms is mere marketing: an attempt to signal that these are somehow different from, and superior to, casinos. Certainly that’s what I think.

What’s less clear to me is why newsrooms are going along for the ride. (I have my suspicions about why this makes sense to Substack.) Is Dow Jones so strapped for cash that it’s stooped to this? Or is it the case that the people running CNN, CNBC, and Dow Jones truly have gotten so confused by pseudo-events that they no longer understand the difference between concocted media circuses and actual happenings in the world?

I also wonder whether this push to legitimize gambling will undermine trust in people who are trained and accountable, who specialize in writing about reality. In the same way that many audiences prefer pseudo-events to events, we may discover that people prefer the “wisdom” of thousands of anons attempting to predict the future to actual reporting on the current conditions around us. Seems like that’s what Polymarket and Kalshi are betting on, anyway.

Juggling multiple chargers for your gadgets while you’re commuting, working from a cafe, or traveling can get heavy (and pricey!) fast, which is why today’s deal on the Anker Prime Power Bank (20K, 200W) is worth checking out. It can quickly charge three devices at once — including laptops — and it’s down to just $79.99 ($60 off) in black at Woot, which is a new low, through February 27th.

Anker says the 20,000mAh power bank is powerful enough to get an iPhone 16 Pro to 30 percent in just 15 minutes or a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in about 40 minutes, making it an easy way to quickly top up your devices while on the go. To deliver those speeds, it offers up to 200W of combined output via two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can charge everything from earbuds to handheld consoles, e-readers, and more. And when the power pack dies, it supports 100W fast recharging via the USB-C port, allowing it to fully recharge in a little over an hour.

Additionally, the power bank offers a useful smart display, which lets you check the remaining battery, power input, and power output at a glance, including how many watts each port is drawing. Roughly the size of a deck of cards and weighing about a pound, it’s also easy to slip into a bag and carry on the go. Rounding things out, Anker includes a two-foot USB-C to USB-C cable and a travel pouch, so you have everything you need right out of the box.

Samsung unleashed a new batch of Galaxy Z TriFold units after selling out initial stock of the behemoth foldable that turns into a 10-inch tablet. It took less than ten minutes to sell through today’s supply, which either speaks to the phone’s surprising popularity or, rather, just how few of them the company is making. The device launched on January 30th, and unlike most other Samsung phones, availability of this one was limited to the company’s own site.

The TriFold costs $2,899.99 and comes with 512GB of storage (you’d think paying this much would get you at least 1TB, but alas). It’s essentially three phones in one; one when it’s folded, another when it opens to double the screen real estate, and ultimately, in its final form is as a large tablet that makes multitasking easier than with vastly inferior (joking) single-hinge foldables.

While my colleague Allison Johnson waited for our review unit to show up, she had a surprisingly good time with using the Z Fold 7 as a fold-out portable computer when paired with a wireless keyboard. It seems safe to say that using the TriFold, with its extra screen real estate, would make this kind of setup even better. Whether it’s nearly $1,000 better, though, is a question that only you can answer with your wallet.

Update, February 20th 10:22am ET: Samsung sold out of TriFolds within minutes, so I updated this piece to reflect that the waiting game continues for those who couldn’t proceed to checkout.

Tamron has announced a new USB-C dongle that wirelessly connects compatible lenses to mobile devices and laptops so they can be customized and controlled remotely. It works with 16 of the company’s lenses to start. The $50 Tamron-Link dongle is available now, and while its Bluetooth range is limited to just over 16-feet, it’s one less cable you’ll need to wrangle during a shoot.

The dongle works with a variety of Tamron Sony E, Nikon Z, and Canon RF APS-C lenses , according to PetaPixel, with support for more lenses coming through future firmware updates. It wirelessly connects the lenses to the Tamron Lens Utility app introduced last June and is available for iOS and iPadOS, Android mobile devices, and PCs and Macs.

The app isn’t needed to use Tamron’s lenses, but it introduces some advanced functionality that can be useful when shooting video without a full crew of camera operators, or still photography when precise settings adjustments are needed. You can set markers for different focus positions and specify how long it takes the lens to adjust between them, creating an automated and repeatable transition where the focus in a video dramatically shifts from one person to another. You can also electronically limit the focus range on a lens, ensuring that you’re not accidentally focusing on something in the distant background while capturing a moving subject.

The basic functionality of lenses can also be customized through the app. You can change the direction of the focus and aperture rings, toggle between linear and non-linear adjustments for the focus ring, and customize the functionality of buttons on the lens. Even firmware updates will be slightly more convenient, although they may take just a bit longer over Bluetooth.

﻿I’ll be answering subscriber questions today at 11AM PT / 2PM ET. Come geek out with me about laptops, photography, the great state of New Jersey, or other nerdy things.

What up, Verge-heads! Wait. “Vergesters?” “Verge-igans?” Nope, that ain’t it…

Antonio here. 👋🏻 I’m your friendly neighborhood laptop reviewer, and I’m hosting an exclusive subscriber “AMA” today at 11AM PT / 2PM ET. I review laptops ranging from MacBooks and Chromebooks to weird-but-awesome tablets and a $6,000 gaming laptop. So I have a fairly wide range of experience with some of the best computers you can own: what their screens look like, how nice they are to type on, if their trackpads suck or not, and, of course, how many ugly stickers you’ll be removing if you buy one yourself.

My job has me using both Windows and macOS, so I find things to appreciate and dislike in both. I’ve also dabbled a bit in Linux with Bazzite, which I love, but I haven’t found the time to dive as deep as my colleagues Nathan, Stevie, or Terrence.

Outside of laptops, I occasionally cover cameras and mechanical keyboards, and once in a while I pitch in to support our games coverage (just a little). I also do my own product photography for my reviews, because I work remotely.

I’m a chatterbox who’s always keen to talk shop about any of this stuff or geeky hobbies like fountain pens, watches, or Gunpla (one of my dad-hobbies of choice). So join me today, ask some questions, and let’s shoot the shit.

This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest gizmos and potions that swear they’re going to change your life. Opt in for Optimizer here.

While scrolling through my TikTok feed, I often find myself thinking of Elizabeth Báthory. Legend has it that Báthory, a powerful 16th-century Hungarian countess, would kill virgins and bathe in their blood to retain her youth. Historians have debated whether Báthory really was a serial killer, though most agree she probably didn’t actually bathe in blood. Still, she’s what I think of anytime I see how far vanity will take us: vampire facials, snail mucin, bird poop treatments, and now Rejuran — a Korean skincare serum with the hottest new ingredient, PDRN. In case you were unaware, PDRN comes from salmon sperm.

Usually, these ads show skinfluencers with bouncy, hydrated skin extracting a clear liquid from a silver bottle. This serum, they say, is a game changer. Rubbing it into your face will promote skin rejuvenation, elasticity, and collagen production. The result is enhanced healing, improved skin texture, and reduced wrinkles, and it’s all thanks to patented science. Rejuran’s PDRN molecule is 670 times smaller than your pores, meaning enhanced absorption.

You can be the most skeptical person on the planet, but it’s hard to argue with the human desire to be young and beautiful.

“PDRN stands for polydeoxyribonucleotide, which essentially is just a DNA fragment,” says Victoria Fu, a cosmetic chemist and one of the founders behind the Chemist Confessions skincare brand. “Super old-school PDRN treatments actually come from human placenta, but now salmon sperm PDRN has become the industry standard.”

According to Fu, beauty trends like injectables often stem from the medical field. Before it became a hot skincare ingredient, PDRN was studied as an injected therapeutic treatment for conditions like diabetic foot ulcers, and there are some promising studies for injectable PDRN that suggest it could be helpful for wound healing — though PDRN injectables haven’t been FDA-approved in the US. Generally speaking, injectables are considered more effective for rapid, dramatic, and structural changes, as they’re able to deliver ingredients deeper into the skin. Injectable hyaluronic acid, for instance, is more effective at restoring volume than topical hyaluronic acid.

Online, PDRN started gaining notoriety a few years ago as skinfluencers shuttled themselves to South Korea for salmon DNA facials. In the typical video, these beauty influencers would giggle. Come with me to get a salmon sperm facial! Usually, a doctor is shown injecting PDRN into the skin every few millimeters until the influencer’s face is riddled with tiny, swollen mounds. It hurts so much! Recovery takes so long! But just LOOK at this glow!!!

The painful treatment blew up once celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Aniston admitted to incorporating salmon sperm facials into their routines. And then, about a year ago, Rejuran — the company behind the injections — announced a topical version. No scary needles, no need to fly to Korea, and a bottle costs about $52, whereas the facial could run anywhere from $500 to $700. Now, you can find PDRN in all kinds of skincare products ranging from eye creams to sunscreen.

Despite authoring this newsletter, I’m not immune to wellness fads. I covet glass skin like any other vain 30-something afraid of the harsh ravages of time. I’ve bought the stupid TikTok skincare wand that influencers said was “clinically proven” and that Hailey Bieber uses. I reviewed its clinical studies on electroporation — microcurrents that supposedly tear tiny holes in your skin to help products absorb better — and knew it was dubious (if relatively harmless).

Which is to say, I knew it was a red flag when I heard an influencer in a Rejuran ad say the product was “clinically proven,” but I bought a bottle anyway. I’ve used two bottles of Rejuran’s topical ampoule and other skincare products marketing hot new ingredients like volufiline, because that’s the power of science-adjacent wellness marketing. (Volufiline is a new plant-based compound that’s marketed as “topical filler” because it stimulates fat cell production.)

Still, if you truly could replicate injectable results in an easily accessible serum — that’s a compelling claim. So I asked Fu if any of the claims about topical PDRN being as effective as injected skincare treatments held water.

“There’s some early research supporting PDRN in medical and aesthetic procedures, but evidence for topical PDRN is still very limited,” says Fu. “A serum cannot be a non-invasive substitute for an injectable procedure.”

The reason is straightforward. Even if there’s evidence that PDRN itself could be an effective ingredient, the mode of delivery matters.

“Injectable treatments deliver material directly into skin tissue at concentrations and depths topical products simply won’t be able to achieve,” says Fu.

But silly things like facts aren’t enough to stop skincare brands from jumping on experimental fads so long as they’re not technically harmful.

Just the other day, I was served a video from megaviral beauty influencer Mikayla Nogueira announcing to her 17 million followers that she’s launching a salmon-derived PDRN face ampoule and eye serum for her own cosmetics line.

“A science-backed duo powered by PDRN that is going to lift, firm, plump your skin plus so much more. Not to mention these products are made in Korea, dermatologist tested, clinically tested, and proven to do exactly what they say they’re going to do,” Nogueira says in the ad. She goes on to say that she worked with Korean cosmetics chemists, and uses phrases like “low molecular weight” and “efficacious” levels.

I have no doubt Nogueira believes in PDRN products. But as I wrote in a recent Optimizer, “clinically tested” and “science-backed” are marketing phrases that don’t always mean what you think.

Meanwhile, other brands are advertising less icky versions of PDRN derived from plants. There are ginseng-derived PDRN products on the market, like the VT Cosmetics PDRN Essence 100, and the Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum derived from roses. Supposedly, these brands would have you believe plant-based PDRN is just as effective and a vegan alternative.

“PDRN source, purity, molecular size, and stabilization all matter,” says Fu. “‘Plant-based PDRN’ is a bit of a marketing gray area. It may be DNA fragments, but it’s not automatically equivalent to the clinical material studied in medical literature. Two products can list PDRN and behave very differently. The good news is we are seeing more studies come out on these plant PDRNs, so hopefully we can better gauge these different sources soon.”

Fu says all things considered, PDRN is a “relatively vanilla” skincare active that’s unlikely to irritate your skin and is fine for curious skincare hobbyists to experiment with. But that also means it’s not a foundational part of any skincare routine. Things like sunscreen, moisturizers, and well-studied actives like retinoids are more likely to do the heavy lifting in any regimen. Like most things in the wellness space, the main harm that PDRN poses is to your wallet. Fu says that consistency and patience are the key to getting real, long-term results. (Unfortunately, these are also the two things most consumers would like to bypass.)

“Social media has made it possible for consumers to hear from industry insiders like ourselves,” Fu says, referring to herself and her partner, Gloria Lu. In addition to running their own cosmetics brand, the two chemists also write a skincare science education blog and host a podcast. “But the flip side is that consumers will also hear a LOT of noise and contradicting information from all sorts of directions.”

Fu says the smart thing to do is look at any testing a brand is willing to share and look for quantifiable grading metrics over consumer perception. As in, “34 percent improvement in elasticity” is a more meaningful claim than “90 percent of users agree they saw an improvement in skin hydration in two weeks.” Before and after pictures, she says, can also be misleading due to inconsistent lighting or face angles. If a claim sounds too good to be true, it likely is.

“We try to remind everyone to refrain from a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction and not to let the trends distract you from sticking to the fundamentals of your routine,” says Fu.

Having spent the past three months slathering a salmon sperm serum on my face, I honestly couldn’t tell you if it’s improved my skin. Maybe it’s a smidge glowier. I think it helped with one stubborn acne scar. I knew that I wouldn’t see dramatic results going in, just as I knew that the trendy volufiline serums that skinfluencers claim are “filler in a bottle” wouldn’t fix my undereyes. Is it egregious that I know better and still partook? Maybe. But to Fu’s point, I’m religious about the fundamentals — sunscreen, moisturizer, and as of recently, tretinoin, which I incorporated after consulting my dermatologist. The point is that I’ve done my homework and made an informed choice.

It just so happened that this time, I thought experimenting with salmon jizz serums was harmless fun.

AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views.It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms. Read the full story.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

This year, hype around AI really exploded, and so did concerns about AI’s environmental footprint. We also saw some surprising biotech developments.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

            <h2>Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/gartner-110m-sale-of-digital-markets-division-in-latest-sec-filing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.
