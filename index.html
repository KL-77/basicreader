            <h2>Instagram user fights DHS for the right to post ICE sightings anonymously</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is fighting to unmask the owner of Facebook and Instagram accounts of a community watch group monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

Defending the right to post about ICE sightings anonymously is a Meta account holder for MontCo Community Watch, John Doe.

Doe has alleged that when the DHS sent a “summons” to Meta asking for subscriber information, it infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity, i.e., the right to publish content critical of government agencies and officials without fear of government retaliation. He also accused DHS of ignoring federal rules and seeking to vastly expand its authority to subpoena information to unmask ICE’s biggest critics online.

“I believe that my anonymity is the only thing standing between me and unfair and unjust persecution by the government of the United States,” Doe said in his complaint.

In response, DHS alleged that the community watch group that posted “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that a statute regulating imports and exports empowered DHS to investigate the group’s alleged threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder” ICE agents.

DHS claims that Meta must comply with the subpoena because the government needs to investigate a “serious” threat “to the safety of its agents and the performance of their duties.”

On Wednesday, a US district judge will hear arguments to decide if Doe is right or if DHS can broadly unmask critics online by claiming it’s investigating supposed threats to ICE agents. With more power, DHS officials have confirmed they plan to criminally prosecute critics posting ICE videos online, Doe alleged in a lawsuit filed last October.

DHS alleged that the community watch group posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things,” was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties.” Claiming that the subpoena had nothing to do with silencing government critics, they argued that DHS is authorized to investigate the group and that compelling interest supersedes Doe’s First Amendment rights.

According to Doe’s most recent court filing, DHS is pushing a broad reading of a statute that empowers DHS to subpoena information about the “importation/exportation of merchandise&quot;—like records to determine duties owed or information to unmask a drug smuggler or child sex trafficker. DHS claims the statute isn’t just about imports and exports but also authorizes DHS to seize information about anyone they can tie to an investigation of potential crimes that violate US customs laws.

However, it seems to make no sense, Doe argued, that Congress would “silently embed unlimited subpoena authority in a provision keyed to the importation of goods.” Doe hopes the US district judge will agree that DHS’s summons was unconstitutional.

“The subscriber information for social media accounts publishing speech critical of ICE that DHS seeks is completely unrelated to the importation/exportation of merchandise; the records are outside the scope of DHS’s summons power,” Doe alleged.

And even if the court agrees on DHS’s reading of the statute, DHS has not established that unmasking the owner of the community watch accounts would be relevant to any legitimate criminal investigation, Doe alleged.

To convince the court that the case was really about chilling speech, Doe attached every post made on the group’s Facebook and Instagram feeds. None show threats or arguably implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS claimed. Instead, the users shared “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils,” Doe said.

Ariel Shapell, an attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told Ars that “if you go and look at the content on the Facebook and Instagram profiles at issue here, it’s pretty innocuous.”

DHS claimed to have received information about the group supposedly “stalking and gathering of intelligence on federal agents involved in ICE operations.” However, Doe argued that “unsurprisingly, neither DHS nor its declarant cites any post even allegedly constituting any such threat. To the contrary, all posts on these social media accounts constitute speech addressing important public issues fully protected under the First Amendment,” Doe argued.

“Reporting on, or even livestreaming, publicly occurring immigration operations is fully protected First Amendment activity,” Doe argued. “DHS does not, and cannot, show how such conduct constitutes an assault, kidnapping, or murder of a federal law enforcement officer, or a threat to do any of those things.”

Doe’s motion to quash the subpoena arrives at a time when recent YouGov polling suggests that Americans have reached a tipping point in ending support for ICE. YouGov’s poll found more people disapprove of how ICE is handling its job than approve, following the aftermath of nationwide anti-ICE protests over Renee Good’s killing. ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Good’s death and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

As sharing ICE footage has swayed public debate, DHS has seemingly sought to subpoena Meta and possibly other platforms for subscriber information.

In October, Meta refused to provide names of users associated with Doe’s accounts—as well as “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses&quot;—without further information from DHS. Meta then gave Doe the opportunity to move to quash the subpoena to stop the company from sharing information.

That request came about a week after DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests after account holders defended First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash the subpoena, Doe’s court filing said.

It’s unclear why DHS withdrew those subpoenas but maintained Doe’s. DHS has alleged that the government’s compelling interest in Doe’s identity outweighs First Amendment rights to post anonymously online. The agency also claimed it has met its burden to unmask Doe as “someone who is allegedly involved in threatening ICE agents and impeding the performance of their duties,” which supposedly “touches DHS’s investigation into threats to ICE agents and impediments to the performance of their duties.”

Whether Doe will prevail is hard to say, but Politico reported that DHS’s “defense will rest on whether DHS’s argument that posting videos and images of ICE officers and warnings about arrests is considered criminal activity.” It may weaken DHS’s case that Border Patrol Tactical Commander Greg Bovino recently circulated a “legal refresher” for agents in the field, reminding them that protestors are allowed to take photos and videos of “an officer or operation in public,” independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported.

Shapell told Ars that there seems to be “a lot of distance” between the content posted on Doe’s accounts and relevant evidence that could be used in DHS’s alleged investigation into criminal activity. And meanwhile, “there are just very clear First Amendment rights here to associate with other people anonymously online and to discuss political opinions online anonymously,” Shapell said, which the judge may strongly uphold as core protected activity as threats of government retaliation mount.

“These summonses chill people’s desire to communicate about these sorts of incredibly important developments on the Internet, even anonymously, when there’s a threat that they could be unmasked and investigated for this really core First Amendment protected activity,” Shapell said.

A win could reassure Meta users that they can continue posting about ICE online without fear of retaliation should Meta be pressed to share their information.

Ars could not immediately reach DHS for comment. Meta declined to comment, only linking Ars to an FAQ to help users understand how the platform processes government requests.</div>

            <h2>FDA deletes warning on bogus autism therapies touted by RFK Jr.‘s allies</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/warning-about-bogus-autism-treatments-vanishes-from-fdas-website/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the Food and Drug Administration provided an informational webpage for parents warning them of the dangers of bogus autism treatments, some promoted by anti-vaccine activists and “wellness” companies. The page cited specifics scams and the “significant health risks” they pose.

But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has numerous ties to the wellness industry—that FDA information webpage is now gone. It was quietly deleted at the end of last year, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to Ars Technica.

The defunct webpage, titled “Be Aware of Potentially Dangerous Products and Therapies that Claim to Treat Autism,” provided parents and other consumers with an overview of the problem. It began with a short description of autism and some evidence-based, FDA-approved medications that can help manage autism symptoms. Then, the regulatory agency provided a list of some false claims and unproven, potentially dangerous treatments it had been working to combat. “Some of these so-called therapies carry significant health risks,” the FDA wrote.

The list included chelation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatments that those in the anti-vaccine and wellness spheres have championed.

Chelation is a real treatment for heavy metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning. But it has been co-opted by anti-vaccine activists and wellness gurus, who falsely claim it can treat autism, among other things. These sham treatments can come in a variety of forms, including sprays, suppositories, capsules, and liquid drops. Actual FDA-approved chelation therapy products are prescription only, the agency noted, and chelating certain minerals from the body “can lead to serious and life-threatening outcomes.”

Many anti-vaccine activists promote the false and thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and more specifically, that trace metal components in some vaccines cause the neurological disorder. For years, anti-vaccine activists like Kennedy focused on thimerosal, a vaccine preservative that contains ethylmercury. Thimerosal was largely removed from childhood vaccines by 2001 amid unfounded concerns. The removal made no impact on autism rates, and many studies have continued to show that it is safe and not a cause of autism. Anti-vaccine activists moved on to blame other vaccine components for autism, including aluminum, which is used in some vaccines to help spur protective immune responses. It too has been found to be safe and not linked to autism.

To address this nonexistent problem, anti-vaccine activists have touted chelation as a way to remove metals delivered via vaccines and treat autism. One of the most notorious of these activists is David Geier, whom Kennedy hired to the US health department last year to study the debunked connection between vaccines and autism. David Geier, along with his late father, Mark Geier, faced discipline from the Maryland State Board of Physicians in 2011 for, among other things, putting the health of autistic children at risk by treating them with unproven and dangerous hormone and chelation therapies. Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who is not a scientist or doctor, was issued a civil fine for practicing medicine without a license.

The FDA’s now-deleted webpage also warned of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is basically a treatment in which a patient breathes oxygen inside a pressurized chamber. This, again, is a real treatment for some specific conditions, including decompression sickness experienced by scuba divers. But it has been embraced by the wellness industry as a treatment for a wide variety of conditions, including autism, and it is now being offered in settings without trained staff or proper equipment—sometimes with tragic outcomes.

In January 2025, a 5-year-old boy was killed in a hyperbaric chamber in a wellness center in Michigan after static electricity sparked a flash fire inside the chamber. The wellness center claimed to use the chambers to treat a variety of conditions, including autism.

Kennedy has continued to promote the therapy. In May, Kennedy joined Gary Brecka—a wellness influencer and supplement seller—for a hyperbaric oxygen chamber treatment, as well as intravenous nutrient drips. They then recorded a podcast in which Kennedy lambasted the financial influence of Big Pharma.

In July, KFF Health News reported that Kennedy and his wellness allies have made millions promoting unproven wellness products and treatments. Likewise, a story last week from The Wall Street Journal reported that Kennedy has surrounded himself with wellness moguls, including Brecka, who are profiting from the administration’s unambiguous embrace of unproven treatments.

Beyond chelation and hyperbaric chambers as bogus autism treatments, the FDA also warned of “detoxifying clay baths,” which are another way wellness companies falsely claim to draw out metals, toxins, or pollutants they claim are behind autism. The agency ended by noting that there’s a wide variety of other bogus products and claims, including raw camel milk, MMS (chlorine dioxide), and essential oils. Without an exhaustive list, the agency provided general advice to be skeptical of treatments that are said to treat a wide variety of conditions, are termed “miracle cures” or a “quick fix,” and those supported by anecdotes rather than scientific evidence.

When Ars Technica reached out to the US health department about the webpage’s disappearance, the agency claimed that it was “retired” during a “routine cleanup” last month, during which other old articles were also removed. The removed webpage on bogus autism treatments was dated 2019.

In lieu of that warning page, the health department pointed Ars to another page about health fraud, titled “Medication Health Fraud for Specific Diseases and Conditions.” The page includes brief information on nearly a dozen health topics, from cancer drug fraud to anti-aging scams. Some of the topics include links to more specific information, including a link to illegal cancer treatments from 2017, which had not been retired.

The webpage has a section on autism, but it has no links and is two sentences long. It states:

“Unproven drug products for sale that claim to cure or treat autism are misleading and deceptive. They can lead to serious health problems while offering false hope for a condition that currently has no cure.”</div>

            <h2>Hegseth wants to integrate Musk’s Grok AI into military networks this month</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/hegseth-wants-to-integrate-musks-grok-ai-into-military-networks-this-month/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he plans to integrate Elon Musk’s AI tool, Grok, into Pentagon networks later this month. During remarks at the SpaceX headquarters in Texas reported by The Guardian, Hegseth said the integration would place “the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department.”

The announcement comes weeks after Grok drew international backlash for generating sexualized images of women and children, although the Department of Defense has not released official documentation confirming Hegseth’s announced timeline or implementation details.

During the same appearance, Hegseth rolled out what he called an “AI acceleration strategy” for the Department of Defense. The strategy, he said, will “unleash experimentation, eliminate bureaucratic barriers, focus on investments, and demonstrate the execution approach needed to ensure we lead in military AI and that it grows more dominant into the future.”

As part of the plan, Hegseth directed the DOD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to use its full authority to enforce department data policies, making information available across all IT systems for AI applications.

“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.

If implemented, Grok would join other AI models the Pentagon has adopted in recent months. In July 2025, the defense department issued contracts worth up to $200 million for each of four companies, including Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI, for developing AI agent systems across different military operations. In December 2025, the Department of Defense selected Google’s Gemini as the foundation for GenAI.mil, an internal AI platform for military use.

Grok has faced multiple scandals since xAI received the July defense contract. Just days before the contract announcement, the chatbot began generating antisemitic content, declaring itself a “super-Nazi,” adopting the name “MechaHitler,” and posting racist material. The incident prompted one US government agency to drop Grok from a General Services Administration contract offering in August, according to emails reviewed by Wired.

More recently, as we mentioned above, users discovered they could create non-consensual intimate images of real people through Grok within the social media platform X. One researcher who conducted a 24-hour analysis estimated that Grok generated over 6,000 sexually suggestive images per hour.

xAI has not publicly addressed the image-generation concerns, though the company attempted to restrict some image-editing features to paid subscribers. The restrictions proved incomplete, as users could still access editing functions through different parts of the X platform and the standalone Grok app.

Indonesia blocked access to Grok on Saturday due to imagery issues, with Malaysia implementing a similar block shortly after. British regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X because Grok is being used to create manipulated images of women and children. Democratic senators have called for Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores until the company improves safeguards.

The Pentagon has not publicly explained its evaluation process for Grok given these incidents. Significant questions remain about which security measures will protect classified military networks from similar behavioral problems and which technical measures will attempt to keep Grok from confabulating inaccurate analysis of important military data.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/microsoft-vows-to-cover-full-power-costs-for-energy-hungry-ai-data-centers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.

As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been racing to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have profound economic effects on the surrounding areas where they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through heavy power consumption and by straining water supplies due to server cooling needs.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is more than 40 years old and under strain.

It’s a big enough issue that in December, US senators launched a probe demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.

Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in the company’s blog post about the announcement that the company will “set a high bar” for responsible data center development, making promises that seem targeted to quell the growing criticism surrounding AI data center construction.

The company’s plan to address the issues includes five commitments: covering full electricity costs to prevent rate increases for residents, minimizing water use while replenishing more than the company withdraws, creating local jobs, paying full property taxes, and investing in AI training programs for data center communities.

In the Microsoft blog post, Smith acknowledged that residential electricity rates have recently risen in dozens of states, driven partly by inflation, supply chain constraints, and grid upgrades. He wrote that communities “value new jobs and property tax revenue, but not if they come with higher power bills or tighter water supplies.”

Microsoft says it will ask utilities and public commissions to set rates high enough to cover the full electricity costs for its data centers, including infrastructure additions. In Wisconsin, the company is supporting a new rate structure that would charge “Very Large Customers,” including data centers, the cost of the electricity required to serve them.

Smith wrote that while some have suggested the public should help pay for the added electricity needed for AI, Microsoft disagrees. He stated, “Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI.”

On water usage for cooling, Microsoft plans a 40 percent improvement in data center water-use intensity by 2030. A recent environmental audit from AI model-maker Mistral found that training and running its Large 2 model over 18 months produced 20.4 kilotons of CO2 emissions and evaporated enough water to fill 112 Olympic-size swimming pools, illustrating the aggregate environmental impact of AI operations at scale.

To solve some of these issues, Microsoft says it has launched a new AI data center design using a closed-loop system that constantly recirculates cooling liquid, dramatically cutting water usage. In this design, already deployed in Wisconsin and Georgia, potable water is no longer needed for cooling.

On property taxes, Smith stated in the blog post that the company will not ask local municipalities to reduce their rates. The company says it will pay its full share of local property taxes. Smith wrote that Microsoft’s goal is to bring these commitments to life in the first half of 2026. Of course, these are PR-aligned company goals and not realities yet, so we’ll have to check back in later to see whether Microsoft has been following through on its promises.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/googles-updated-veo-model-can-make-vertical-videos-from-reference-images-with-4k-upscaling/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s Veo video AI made stunning leaps in fidelity in 2025, and Google isn’t stopping in 2026. The company has announced an update for Veo 3.1 that adds new capabilities when you provide the model with reference material, known as Ingredients to Video. The results should be more consistent, and output supports vertical video and higher-resolution upscaling.

With Ingredients to Video, you can provide the AI with up to three images to incorporate into the generated video. You can use that to provide the robot with characters to animate, backgrounds, and material textures. When you do that, the newly upgraded model will allegedly make fewer random alterations, hemming closer to the reference images. You can also generate multiple clips and even prompt for changes to the setting or style while keeping other elements consistent.

Google is also expanding its support for mobile-first video in Veo. When using Ingredients to Video, you can now specify outputs in a 9:16 (vertical) ratio. That makes it ideal for posting on social apps like Instagram or TikTok, as well as uploading as a YouTube Short. So get ready for even more phone-centric slop. Google added support for vertical videos via a text prompt last year.

Enhanced support for Ingredients to Video and the associated vertical outputs are live in the Gemini app today, as well as in YouTube Shorts and the YouTube Create app, fulfilling a promise initially made last summer. Veo videos are short—just eight seconds long for each prompt. It would be tedious to assemble those into a longer video, but Veo is perfect for the Shorts format.

The new Veo 3.1 update also adds an option for higher-resolution video. The model now supports 1080p and 4K outputs. Google debuted 1080p support last year, but it’s mentioning that option again today, suggesting there may be some quality difference. 4K support is new, but neither 1080p nor 4K outputs are native. Veo creates everything in 720p resolution, but it can be upscaled “for high-fidelity production workflows,” according to Google. However, a Google rep tells Ars that upscaling is only available in Flow, the Gemini API, and Vertex AI. Video in the Gemini app is always 720p.

We are rushing into a world where AI video is essentially indistinguishable from real life. Google, which more or less controls online video via YouTube’s dominance, is at the forefront of that change. Today’s update is reasonably significant, and it didn’t even warrant a version number change. Perhaps we can expect more 2025-style leaps in video quality this year, for better or worse.</div>

            <h2>Starlink tries to stay online in Iran as regime jams signals during protests</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-tries-to-stay-online-in-iran-as-regime-jams-signals-during-protests/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump asked Elon Musk to get Starlink working more reliably in Iran to thwart the Iranian government’s Internet shutdown. Starlink operator SpaceX was apparently already working on the problem before Trump reached out to Musk.

Iran severed Internet connections and phone lines last week as the government conducted a violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, according to numerous reports, which say that thousands of people have been killed.

Starlink hasn’t been completely disabled. The government’s jamming technology has reportedly caused Starlink packet loss of anywhere from 30 to 80 percent.

It appears that SpaceX has been trying to bypass the jamming for days. NasNet, a group that helps Iranians access Starlink, said in an X post on Saturday that it collaborated with the Starlink technical team on an update that reduced packet loss to about 10 percent. But the group described Starlink availability as “an ongoing game of cat and mouse; therefore, conditions may change again or even worsen,” according to a translation.

Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One that he wants Starlink to be available in Iran. “We may get the Internet going, if that’s possible,” Trump said, according to The Washington Post. “We may speak to Elon, ‘cause as you know, he’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company. So we may speak to Elon Musk. And in fact, I’m going to call him as soon as I’m finished with you.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that Trump “has spoken to Elon” about Internet service in Iran.

SpaceX’s satellite Internet service has been used during protests despite the Iranian government “never authorizing Starlink to function, making the service illegal to possess and use,” The Associated Press wrote. Iranian authorities started “searching for and confiscating Starlink dishes in western Tehran” over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterday.

In 2022, during a previous round of protests in which the Iranian government cracked down on demonstrators and cut off Internet access, the Biden administration issued a general license to let US companies make Internet services available to Iranians.

The Iranian government’s jamming of Starlink has apparently gotten more sophisticated, degrading uploads to make it hard for users to distribute information and images of protests. “I believe that they are using some military-grade jamming tools to jam the radio frequency signals, particularly jamming any videos, any content, any reports coming out of Iran,” Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of US-based nonprofit Holistic Resilience, told The Washington Post.

“You don’t need a global kill switch to cripple the network,” Kimberly Burke, director of government affairs at consulting firm Quilty Space, told the Post. “You just make it unstable, slow and unreliable enough that it barely even works. Think intermittent dial-up speeds.”

Internet monitoring group NetBlocks told Reuters that Starlink access is reduced but not eliminated in Iran. “It is patchy, but still there,” NetBlocks founder Alp Toker said.

NetBlocks has been posting updates on Mastodon, saying that Iran’s connectivity to the outside world has remained at about 1 percent of ordinary levels. “Iran has now been offline for 120 hours,” NetBlocks said today. “Despite some phone calls now connecting, there is no secure way to communicate and the general public remain cut off from the outside world.”

Cloudflare’s monitoring reached similar conclusions. “In the last few days, Internet traffic from Iran has effectively dropped to zero,” Cloudflare Head of Data Insight David Belson wrote in a blog post today.

Although connectivity was restored for brief periods on January 9, “no significant changes have been observed in Iran’s Internet traffic since January 10,” he wrote. “The country remains almost entirely cut off from the global Internet, with internal data showing traffic volumes remaining at a fraction of a percent of previous levels.”

A fundraising page for sending Starlink terminals to Iran and covering subscription costs says that “over 100,000 people in Iran are already using Starlink to bypass censorship.” Since the government can’t fully block the service, it has used bans and banking sanctions to make it “extremely difficult for users inside Iran to pay for their subscriptions,” the fundraising page says.

NasNet said today that service is now being made available for free. “After weeks of continuous efforts, negotiations, and discussions with the Starlink team and United States authorities, we have successfully provided access to Starlink for free to serve the revolution,” NasNet wrote on X, according to a translation. “All you need to do is turn on the device. Don’t forget physical camouflage, hiding the Starlink IP, and changing the wireless network name!”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The future is here, and it’s bouncing all over the back alleys of China.

Numerous clips of autonomous delivery vans ripping around cities have swirled on Chinese social media in recent days, showcasing the new technology’s capabilities — as well as its many, many shortcomings.

One video which went viral on the Pinterest-like app Xiaohongshu shows a Neolix X3 unit bouncing aggressively as it barrels down a potholed gravel path. The X3 sports two massive lithium batteries on the bottom of its chassis, a configuration which clearly isn’t helping the vehicle’s suspension as it rattles down the block.

“The roads are still from the Qing Dynasty, but the cars are from the next century,” one user wrote under the original post.

Other examples abound, like one of the smaller Neolix X3s freaking out over a road littered with corn cobs, or the stubborn ZTO express delivery van which got itself stuck after driving through wet cement.

In one clip from September, a Shenzhen woman tried in vain to stop a robovan from running over her prized vegetables, which she had been drying out on the side of the road.

The sheer number of clips are indicative of the massive rollout of self-driving vans throughout China.

Neolix, for example, says it’s deployed over 10,000 robovans across 300 cities as of October, according to The Robot Report. In Qingdao alone, there are already more than 1,200 self-driving cargo vans, which have racked over 31 million miles and thousands of deliveries since they’ve been in operation.

Though Neolix isn’t the only robovan company operating throughout the People’s Republic, it’s certainly the biggest. It was the first to obtain an autonomous delivery license in 2021, enabling it to start accumulating miles on select public roads.

Other companies, like Rino.ai, are following in Neolix’s footsteps, with over 2,000 self-driving vans on the road in over 170 cities.

While the clips are unquestionably entertaining, the robovans are clearly presenting a safety hazard on the roads — and likely a glimpse of things to come for the rest of the world.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the government shutdown in November, the Trump administration suddenly accelerated its plans to shutter over a dozen buildings and around 100 laboratories at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

The decision angered Democratic lawmakers, who accused them of going ahead with the “consolidation” effort without even consulting them.

In a November 10 letter addressed to Sean Duffy, who served as NASA’s interim administrator at the time, representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) noted that her staff had received “disturbing reports that NASA is directing the imminent closure of laboratories and facilities hosting mission-critical capabilities” at the GSFC.

Of particular concern is the campus’ main library, which was unceremoniously shut down last month, as the New York Times reported on December 31. NASA officials tried to downplay these concerns seemingly to no avail — as former and current staffers, advisors, and union representatives continue to watch in horror as the GSFC closures go on.

NASA insiders cried foul following the library’s closure, warning that critical and still-undigitized materials could be thrown out in what they said were reckless efforts by the Trump administration.

NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, who was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, was angered by the NYT‘s framing, accusing the newspaper of not fully reflecting the “context NASA shared.” He argued that “at no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials.”

That’s despite later admitting that “some materials with no historical or technical value may not be retained” following a “deliberate review” over a period of 60 days.

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens chimed in as well, describing the moves at Goddard as a “consolidation, not a closure.”

Isaacman’s comments have seemingly done little to reassure rattled NASA staffers. In a January 7 response spotted by Astronomy, Matt Biggs, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — a union that represents thousands of NASA scientists and engineers — accused Isaacman of making “patently false” statements.

“The rapid and haphazard shutdown of the library at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, reported on by The New York Times, decimated this valuable collection housed at NASA’s largest research library,” Biggs wrote.

The labor union boss also took issue with Isaacman’s argument that the consolidation efforts were part of the 2022 Goddard Master Plan, which dates back to the Biden administration.

“This was not part of some ‘long-planned facilities consolidation’ as Isaacman claims,” Biggs wrote. “The Goddard Master Plan, written in 2022, does not call for the library’s closure. Building 21, which houses the library, was scheduled for renovation, not elimination.”

Futurism has reached out to NASA for clarification. The agency failed to reply to a previous request for comment regarding details of the 2022 Master Plan.

Biggs also accused Isaacman of misleadingly stating on X that “NASA researchers will continue to have access to the scientific information and resources they need to do their work.”

“That’s simply not true,” he wrote. “Much of the material that was available in the library in Greenbelt, Maryland, is copyrighted or unique out-of-print material that cannot or has not been digitized and will no longer be available to researchers.”

It’s a precarious moment, as NASA’s future continues to be debated in Congress. If it were up to the White House, the historic agency would face the largest budget cuts in its 67-year history. Lawmakers, however, have since passed a counteroffer that would leave the agency’s science budget largely unaffected for the fiscal year of 2026 — which technically started in October, as the chaos has dragged on.

It’s a major test of Isaacman’s leadership after taking control of an agency in crisis last month. Insiders remain highly skeptical of the Trump administration’s approach. They say NASA should be opening doors, not closing them, especially as the United States looks to return astronauts to the Moon in the coming years.

“Where is the consolidation?” Biggs wrote. “The material is not being consolidated with other holdings; it is simply being lost to Goddard and to the broader research community, much of it is being sent to storage or to the dumpster.”

“NASA’s scientists and engineers shouldn’t have to be dumpster divers to do their work,” he added. “We expect better from NASA and its managers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stuffed with cargo carried a brand new NASA telescope into space, where it was observed deploying in Sun-synchronous orbit, the agency later confirmed.

Dubbed Pandora, the orbital observatory is designed to hunt for distant worlds called exoplanets orbiting other stars. And though not nearly as large or expensive as the James Webb Space Telescope, the 17-inch lens packs a specialized punch that’ll help astronomers do something that was unthinkable just a decade or two ago: glean clues from individual exoplanets too remote for even the mighty Webb to pick up on.

Pandora’s mission will last a year, during which it’s expected to complete observations of at least 20 exoplanets — as well, in a novel development, of the stars they orbit.

This will “shatter a barrier,” according to University of Arizona astronomer Daniel Apai, whose team helped build the telescope — helping “remove a source of noise in the data that limits our ability to study small exoplanets in detail and search for life on them,” he wrote in a new piece for The Conversation.

Exoplanets are incredibly difficult to find, and even harder to study. Look up into the night sky, and you will effortlessly spot millions of stars. The first exoplanet, in contrast, wasn’t confirmed until 1992; to this day, astronomers have found only around 6,000 planets around other stars, a task hindered because the little-if-any light they reflect is blown out by that of nearby stars.

To espy distant worlds, astronomers look for when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective. This is called a transit, and it produces a noticeable dip in the starlight. What’s more, astronomers can analyze the light to tease out properties of the planet it passes through, like the chemicals in its atmosphere. Apai, who is also co-investigator of Pandora, compares this to holding a glass of wine up to a candle: “The light filtering through will show fine details that reveal the quality of the wine.”

Likewise, “by analyzing starlight filtered through the planets’ atmospheres,” he continued, “astronomers can find evidence for water vapor, hydrogen, clouds and even search for evidence of life.”

Astronomers have relied on this clever trick for decades, but recent research, some of it spearheaded by Apai and his colleagues, has shown that it can have a serious flaw. Cooler, volatile regions on the surface of stars, called starspots, can fudge the signals astronomers see, even tricking them into mistaking the water vapor around a star for being present on the planet. Essentially, “we were trying to judge our wine in light of flickering, unstable candles,” Apai said.

That’s where Pandora comes in. Being purpose-built for exoplanet hunting, it can spend far more time observing them than Webb, whose precious time is always in hot demand. Even better, Pandora will observe the stars themselves for 24 hours at a time with infrared and visible light sensors, closely monitoring how the starspots form and evolve. Over the course of its year-long mission, the telescope will revisit each star ten times, racking up hundreds of hours of observations.

“With that information, our Pandora team will be able to figure out how the changes in the stars affect the observed planetary transits,” Apai wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In less time than it takes to get bored of your new year’s resolution, the planet’s wealthiest people had already blown through their yearly ration of carbon emissions.

We’re not speaking figuratively, either. A new analysis by the Oxfam Foundation found that the world’s richest 1 percent exceeded their fair share of annual carbon emissions just 10 days into the year.

The global “carbon budget” is based off the amount of carbon dioxide that humankind can collectively spew while keeping us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. According to Oxfam, the CO2 emissions of the richest 1 percent in just one year will result in an estimated 1.3 million heat-related deaths by the end of the 21st century.

“To stay within the 1.5 degrees limit, the richest 1 percent would have to slash their emissions by 97 percent by 2030,” the study’s press release reads.

Meanwhile, it only took the top 0.1 percent until January 3rd to use up their allotment. Another recent Oxfam report using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute found that the richest 0.1 percent of individuals produce more CO2 pollution in a day than the poorest 50 percent do in a year.

“If everyone emitted like the richest 0.1 percent, the carbon budget would be used up in less than three weeks,” Oxfam implores.

These outrageous figures aren’t just a measure of individual consumption, but of economic power. Since 2024, the top 1 percent has owned more wealth than 95 percent of humanity — not just in cash, but through ownership of powerful assets like mega-corporations and real estate holdings.

The real issue, in other words, isn’t finger wagging about individual consumer choices. The global economy has been built around a vast over-consumption that’s rapidly leading the planet into ecological catastrophe, and the world’s wealthiest are profiting massively. In 2019 for example, an analysis by The Guardian found that just20 fossil fuel companies were responsible for 35 percent of all CO2 and methane pollution since 1965.

Staving off environmental collapse, in other words, will require a difficult confrontation with some of the world’s richest people and the powerful corporations that built their fortunes.

“Time and time again, the research shows that governments have a very clear and simple route to drastically slash carbon emissions and tackle inequality: by targeting the richest polluters,” said Oxfam’s climate change policy lead, Nafkote Dabi. “By cracking down on the gross carbon recklessness of the super-rich, global leaders have an opportunity to put the world back on track for climate targets and unlock net benefits for people and the planet.”

            <div id="article-text">Monkeys are incredible escape artists, known to break out of research labs and even trucks that crashed on the highway.

Private enclosures are also no match for the dexterous and scheming simians. Last week, multiple Vervet monkeys, which are native to sub-Saharan Africa, were spotted roaming the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, alarming officials.

Nobody knows how many of them there are, or where they even came from. It’s also illegal to own Vervet monkeys in the city, so if they’re escaped pets, the owner may not own up to having lost them.

“This is the first time we’ve had a situation dealing with monkeys at large in the city of St. Louis,” Department of Health environmental bureau chief Justen Hauser told NBC News-affiliate KSDK on January 9.

But besides the innate challenges of capturing the agile mammals — as well as an escaped goat also on the loose in the Mound City — the St. Louis Department of Health is being frustrated by a novel hindrance: generative AI slop.

As the Associated Press reports, AI-generated images are complicating rescue efforts because residents have been posting fake images online, claiming to have spotted the monkeys.

“It’s been a lot in regard to AI and what’s genuine and what’s not,” city Department of Health spokesperson Willie Springer told the AP. “People are just having fun. Like, I don’t think anyone means harm.”

AI-generated images circulating on X-formerly-Twitter show the monkeys joining a local gang and hanging out on the stoop. Another shows them drinking out of 40-ounce malt liquor bottles.

While many of the images were intended as a joke, AI-based image generators have advanced to the point where they could easily come up with realistic-looking images of escaped monkeys as well, leading officials on a goose chase.

Springer admitted that they don’t even know how many monkeys are on the loose, saying that there could be up to four of them.

“Original reports suggested there were four animals, but we cannot confirm an actual number at this time, only that there is more than one,” Hauser told the BBC.

Experts at the St. Louis Zoo have since joined the efforts, warning that residents should leave the monkeys alone.

“The monkeys can be intelligent but also unpredictable at times,” Hauser told KSDK last week.

Apart from complicating escaped monkey rescue efforts, generative AI has already turned into a major headache for officials. Case in point, police were forced to issue a warning in October after kids started sending their parents AI-manipulated pictures of them welcoming homeless men into their houses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the final waves of Gen Z — the youngest of whom are currently around 14 — make their way through high school and into colleges and trade schools, some higher education instructors are noticing a severe lack of reading comprehension skills in their students. Schools, in turn, are finding the only path forward is to drastically lower their expectations, for better or worse.

As Pepperdine University literature professor Jessica Hooten Wilson told Fortune in a recent interview, “it’s not even an inability to critically think. It’s an inability to read sentences.”

Wilson is one of the professors who’s had to quietly lower her academic benchmarks thanks to the rise in barely literate Gen Zers graduating American high schools.

Rather than assigning reading outside of class, the literature professor told Fortune she’s adopted a kind of in-class popcorn reading, reciting passages together and discussing them “line by line.” Even that, unfortunately, might be a bit of a stretch for students these days.

“I feel like I am tap dancing and having to read things aloud because there’s no way that anyone read it the night before,” Wilson admitted. “Even when you read it in class with them, there’s so much they can’t process about the very words that are on the page.”

It’s worth pausing here to point out that you can’t really blame younger people for struggling at what were once seen as academic basics. The school system is in shambles, their education was bisected by the COVID pandemic, and they’re been reared in a world that’s increasingly deemphasized reading in favor of videos, voiceovers, and other emerging forms of communication.

Still, the situation is creating practical problems. Timothy O’Malley, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, told Fortune that students showing up unprepared for class isn’t necessarily new, but the lowered expectations are.

In the past, O’Malley said he’s assign anywhere from 25 to 40 pages of reading per class. Students would either do it, or they wouldn’t. Nowadays, that much reading would be unthinkable.

“Today, if you assign that amount of reading, they often don’t know what to do,” he explained to Fortune, adding that most Gen Z students are skating by on AI summaries. “They’ve been formed in a kind of scanning approach to reading.”

The news of Gen Z’s waning literacy comes along with a substantial decline in literary acumen among Americans more broadly. Over the last 20 years, for example, the amount of adults reading recreationally in the US has fallen by 40 percent. Meanwhile, a survey of the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) found that 59 million Americans are reading at a level one competency or below — the lowest level on the PIAAC’s five-point scale.

Whichever way you slice it, younger Americans are barely able to grapple with the written word. Short of major structural changes to the US education system, it’s likely Gen Z won’t be the last generation to experience worse literacy rates than the one that came before.

            <h2>New York governor clears path for robotaxis everywhere, with one notable exception</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/new-york-governor-clears-path-for-robotaxis-everywhere-with-one-notable-exception/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York Governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state — except for its most populous metropolis: New York City.

Hochul, who made the comments Tuesday during her State of the State address, said the legislation would advance the next phase of the state’s autonomous vehicle pilot program.

Details on the proposed legislation and when it might be released are thin. However, there are some hints contained within a document that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address.

Among them is language to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.”

The document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that “demonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.”

It’s not clear what “limited deployment” or “highest possible safety standards” mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company’s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.

The governor’s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor’s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.

Still, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer.

“Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York’s transportation system,” Justin Kintz, Waymo’s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement.

“With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,” said Kintz.

Waymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.

The state’s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.

Still, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.

Even with the permit, Waymo can’t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission.

And while legislation was introduced last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate’s transportation committee. The governor’s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/microsoft-announces-glut-of-new-data-centers-but-says-it-wont-let-your-electricity-bill-go-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.

Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.

On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.

“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”

The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.

It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.

This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.

Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”

In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.

In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”

Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.

She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.

After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.

In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”

In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.

Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”

The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.

Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.

She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”

Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.

While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.

The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.

That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.

Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ammonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.

Humans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.

To prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.

If the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer.

Ammonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.

“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”

But those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases.

To make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.

Ammobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.

The startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.

That could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.

Ammobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each.

Because Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.

“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”

The reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.

Ammobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.

The startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.

“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself.

Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business.

“Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.”

By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.”

When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans.

Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform.

“AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built.

One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage.

Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected.

“I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match.

Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers.

Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage.

“The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous.

He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter.

“Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.”

Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target.

Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator.

The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely.

Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention.

He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it.

“Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.”

But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A resident of Springfield, Tennessee, is expected to plead guilty to hacking the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system dozens of times over several months.

Prosecutors say between August and October 2023, Nicholas Moore, 24, “intentionally accessed a computer without authorization on 25 different days and thereby obtained information from a protected computer,” according to a court document.

As of this writing, there aren’t any more details about exactly what information Moore accessed, nor how it was accessed. Moore is scheduled to plead guilty in court by video link on Friday.

When reached, a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which brought the charges against Moore, told TechCrunch that prosecutors cannot provide any more information that hasn’t already been made public.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information about the case.

Moore’s lawyer, Eugene Ohm, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The case was first spotted by Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes, a researcher and journalist who monitors court documents.

This is one of several occasions in recent years in which hackers have compromised U.S. court systems. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees the federal judiciary, said in August that it had strengthened its cybersecurity defenses following a cyberattack on its electronic court records system.

Hackers working for the Russian government were blamed for the breach.

            <h2>Texas Sends Plato Back to His Cave</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/texas-censorship-plato-philosophy-sexuality/685597/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thomas Jefferson loathed Plato. In 1814, he wrote to John Adams that he had been reading the Republic and came away unimpressed: “Bringing Plato to the test of reason, take from him his sophisms, futilities, & incomprehensibilities, and what remains?” The only reason the Greek philosopher is so revered, Jefferson opined, is that “education is chiefly in the hands of persons who, from their profession, have an interest in the reputation and the dreams of Plato.”

Even so, Jefferson would have been appalled by what happened last week at Texas A&M University. Days before the spring semester began, Martin Peterson, a philosophy professor, was ordered to remove Plato’s Symposium from the list of assigned readings for the class “Contemporary Moral Issues.” Peterson and Plato fell victim to a policy adopted by the university in the fall, which states that classes cannot “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity” without special approval.

In his email response to his department chair, Inside Higher Ed reported, Peterson warned, “You are making Texas A&M famous—but not for the right reasons.” He was right. The case has attracted widespread outrage, including a protest from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. It’s hard to imagine a starker violation of academic freedom than forbidding students to read one of the most famous texts in all of Western philosophy. “Your decision to bar a philosophy professor from teaching Plato is unprecedented,” Peterson protested.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

But although this kind of censorship may be absurd and sinister, it is ironically fitting that Plato, of all philosophers, should be targeted by a regime worried about the effect of subversive ideas on tender minds. Almost 2,500 years ago, Plato’s teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death by the city of Athens for exactly the same reason.

“What do they say? Something of this sort: That Socrates is a doer of evil, and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state.” That is how the charges against him are described in the Apology, one of Plato’s early works, which reports or imagines the speech Socrates delivered in his defense at his trial. He warns his fellow citizens about “the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise man.”

The fate of Socrates convinced Plato that the conflict between philosophy and society was inevitable—especially in a democracy, where public opinion is sacred. In the parable of the cave, in the Republic, Plato compares human beings to cave dwellers who never see the sun, but perceive everything by shadowy firelight. Only the philosopher is able to escape the cave and see the way things really are. But when he returns to share what he’s discovered, and tries to get the others to leave the cave too, they laugh at him, or worse: “If they were somehow able to get their hands on and kill the man who attempts to release and lead up, wouldn’t they kill him?” Socrates asks. “No doubt about it,” replies his conversation partner, Glaucon (who in real life was Plato’s older brother).

The Enlightenment began to challenge this pessimistic view in the 18th century. Jefferson was naturally hostile to Plato’s elitism: If all men are created equal, as the Declaration of Independence said, then everyone should be able to understand the truth, once the weight of authority and tradition is lifted from their shoulders.

In the 20th century, the idea that democracy and freedom of thought went hand in hand began to seem doubtful. Leo Strauss, one of Plato’s most important modern interpreters, was a refugee from Nazi Germany, where the banning and burning of subversive books was extremely popular, especially with college students. The idea that seeking the truth was dangerous, that being a philosopher meant courting popular fury, no longer sounded so antique.

In his 1964 book, The City and Man, Strauss wrote that, for Plato, cities are “assemblies of madmen which corrupt most of those fit to become philosophers, and to which those who have succeeded against all odds in becoming philosophers rightly turn their backs in disgust.” This enmity has existed in most times and places, requiring philosophers to exercise what Strauss called “prudence”—that is, to protect themselves by concealing their most explosively unconventional ideas. Strauss believed that many great philosophers had employed “esoteric writing,” only hinting at their true teachings in their published work, to avoid angering the powers that be.

For most of history, the really dangerous philosophical ideas were those that touched on religion and political power. But the Platonic text censored at Texas A&M is not about these subjects, at least not directly. Rather, the Symposium deals with sex and love. Peterson intended to assign the passage in which Plato elaborates on a myth about the origin of erotic love, proposing that human beings were originally created as bodies joined together. Some of these pairs included two men, some two women, and some a man and a woman. But Zeus cut these doubles in half, and ever since our souls have longed to reunite with their lost mate.

This explains why some people are what we now call homosexual: Their souls were originally part of a same-sex pair. Plato writes that if Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, appeared to a male couple and offered “to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live, live a common life as if you were a single man,” the lovers would certainly agree: “This meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need.”

The Symposium’s sympathetic depiction of same-sex desire—at least between men; no female characters take part in the discussion—has long made Plato what we’d now call “queer-coded.” The Victorian writer John Addington Symonds spoke for many a gay reader when he described the thrill of reading Plato for the first time: “Here in the Phaedrus and the Symposium, I discovered the true Liber Amoris [Book of Love] at last, the revelation I had been waiting for.”

Yet the Symposium insists that erotic desire is not really about sex. What we yearn for is not this or that beautiful body, but the beautiful itself, an ideal that can be found only in the spiritual realm. Plato suggests that this is especially true of love between men, which transcends biology because it doesn’t lead to procreation. Symonds said he found in the Symposium “the consecration of a long-cherished idealism.”

Aziz Huq: The next era of the American university

It’s highly unlikely that the Texas A&M regents read Plato before drafting their policy. If they had, they would have discovered that, far from “advocating gender ideology,” he challenges all of our 21st-century ways of thinking about sex and gender. He is neither “left” nor “right,” because he lived thousands of years before those labels were invented. That is one of the reasons studying Greek philosophy has never become obsolete: In every generation, it allows people to escape the binaries of their own time and think things through from the beginning.

The belief that every student is capable of this kind of thinking, and deserves to experience it, was one of the noblest ideals of democratic education. Now that both democracy and education are under threat in the United States, philosophers may have to relearn the “prudence” that once seemed like a relic of history. Peterson is already employing a classic technique of esoteric writing: calling attention to what he is forced to omit. In his revised syllabus, when the students were originally supposed to read Plato, they will now be assigned a New York Times article about why they can’t.</div>

Welcome back to Atlantic Trivia! Are you hungry for more?

I hope that while I’ve been away, you have been enjoying plenty of food for thought—literally. Research shows that berries help improve memory and that a walnut-heavy diet is associated with higher cognitive performance. Fatty fish and leafy greens are linked to slower cognitive decline. Caffeine is a brain boost too.

A challenge: Combine all these ingredients, Chopped-style, into the perfect pre-trivia meal.

Meanwhile, I have been away these past few weeks thinking mostly about chicken parmigiana. It’s not brain food per se, but I reckon we can call it creativity fuel—so long as it’s eaten for breakfast. That is the suggestion in the first edition of my new newsletter, Better With Time, an eight-week course of ways to add oomph to various parts of the day. Sign up for it here.

And by the way, did you know that when the aforementioned dynasty took power in 1925, its country was still known to the world as Persia? It wasn’t until 1935 that the shah asked the international community to start calling the place Iran, to better reflect its makeup (not all Iranians are ethnically Persian).

This was generally accommodated. Then Winston Churchill got involved; the British premier worried that the new name was too close to Iraq’s and would cause confusion during World War II, when both countries were occupied by the Allies. He requested a temporary swap back, and the Iranians—or Persians?—amazingly agreed.

And by the way, did you know that venison, which comes from the Latin for “to hunt,” once referred to any wild game? That meant deer, but also hare, boar, some goats, and elk and their ilk.

That catchall spirit lives on today in South Africa. Because the country’s continent has no native deer species, venison there means meat from eland, kudu, gemsbok, springbok, or impala—which, to save you a search, are all species of antelope.</div>

            <h2>The Islamic Republic Will Not Last</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-protests-opposition-regime/685600/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Under the cover of a total internet shutdown that has now lasted more than 100 hours, Iran’s security forces have unleashed bone-chilling brutality on protesters, killing at least 2,000 people, according to Iranian officials. Rather than hiding its crimes, the regime has broadcast footage from a morgue on state television. Corpses overflowed the facility, where relatives searched for their loved ones. The news anchor casually declared that the bodies were mostly those of “ordinary people.”

This is not another incidence of the Iranian regime crushing a mass protest. Rather, it might just be the end of the Islamic Republic. But the Iranian opposition could still blow it.

Although Iranians have demonstrated in huge numbers again and again—in 2009–10, 2017–18, 2019–20, and 2022–23—the protest movement has repeatedly failed to produce a well-organized leadership that poses a clear alternative to the regime. If this time is going to be different, the opposition has to fix that problem.

Read: Is the Iranian regime about to collapse?

In this wave of protests, for the first time, thousands of Iranians chanted slogans in support of an opposition leader abroad seeking to dismantle the regime. Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of the former shah, has declared himself ready to lead the transition away from the Islamic Republic. His call for protesters to come out last Thursday and Friday (Iran’s weekend) helped grow the numbers to levels probably unseen since 2009.

Pahlavi doesn’t appear to have a coherent follow-up plan, however. His subsequent calls for workers’ strikes in strategic sectors weren’t answered on any scale. He claims to have the loyalty of thousands of defectors in the security forces, but the evidence for this has not emerged. And although he enjoys significant support on the Iranian street, he still seems to lack the type of organized on-the-ground networks necessary for the long haul.

Politically, Pahlavi has been anything but a unifying figure for the Iranian opposition. Instead of bringing together the opponents of the regime around a shared program, his camp (including his major advisers) antagonizes non-monarchist opponents of the regime. Perhaps in order to draw sole emphasis to pro-Pahlavi slogans such as “Javid shah” (“Long live the king”), his supporters now decry the rallying call of the 2022–23 protests, “Women, life, freedom,” as a distraction. Pahlavi dropped these words from his social-media bios last week. And the former crown prince has persistently implored Donald Trump to intervene militarily in Iran, suggesting that his strategy depends on the aid of a president who just last week refused calls to meet him. (Trump has, however, actively supported the protests, and today admonished Iranians to “KEEP PROTESTING—TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS.”)

Pahlavi has become the opposition front-runner despite these shortcomings mainly because he doesn’t face many rivals. Liberal opposition leaders, such as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi and the former Cabinet minister Mostafa Tajzadeh, languish in prison. Alongside 15 other figures, they issued a call on January 2 for a “peaceful transition” away from the regime. But they enjoy nothing like Pahlavi’s name recognition and are unable to organize their supporters from behind bars. The non-monarchist opposition forces abroad (called “republicans” in Iranian political parlance) have failed to come together, and they spend much of their time complaining about Pahlavi instead of organizing their own ranks. The result is a divided opposition that wages war with itself rather than trying to build a united front against the regime.

Iranians need a unifying and diverse coalition to lead them. The protest movement also needs to secure defections from the regime’s security forces. Without this, it is unlikely to be able to replace the Islamic Republic with a democracy. With it, success is thinkable. Opponents of the Iranian regime have important differences, but most share these common goals: free elections for a constituent assembly, and the safeguarding of Iran’s territorial integrity.

And the Islamic Republic really is in distress. It has been exposed as lacking not just democratic legitimacy but also basic competence. The state has been reduced to clusters of financial and military elites who enrich themselves without even the pretense of acting in the public interest. Of the previous four major rounds of protests, three were sparked by the regime’s inability to provide its people with economic security. Internationally, Iran is now one of the most isolated states in the world. Two decades ago, it could rely on improving ties with Europe, Canada, and Australia, and it held significant sway in the region. Now even its lukewarm relationships with Western countries have gone cold, and it has lost anti-Western allies such as Syria and Venezuela. Pro-Iranian militias in the Arab world have been decimated.

Cold-blooded as it has proved to be, the regime won’t be able to kill its way out of this crisis. The core policies of the 1979 revolution—puritanical sociocultural repression at home and anti-Western and anti-Israeli activity abroad—will have to be discarded. This will be true even if the regime strikes a Venezuela-style deal with Trump in which it offers the scalp of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in exchange for the survival of its security institutions. In such a scenario, the regime’s defining structure—clerical rule shepherded by a grand ayatollah—would have to be abandoned.

Under the combined pressure of Iranian citizens on the streets and adversarial governments abroad, the Islamic Republic is set to finally unravel. Few will miss it—not its Arab and Israeli neighbors; not the far-flung countries in Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere where it has committed its crimes; certainly not Iranians who have suffered under it for almost half a century. What remains is to replace the Islamic Republic with something that reflects the aspirations of Iran’s people.</div>

To judge by recent accounts, Donald Trump’s intervention in Venezuela has imperiled his standing among his own supporters. Traditional-media outlets have warned of a MAGA schism, as have some high-profile right-wing influencers. “President Trump seized control of the Republican Party on an anti-interventionist ‘America First’ platform,” The New York Times reported on January 4, but his removal of Venezuela’s leader “threatened to open a new rift within the political movement he has built.” The former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told the paper that the president’s messaging “on a potential occupation has the base bewildered, if not angry.” Two months before the U.S. military captured Nicolás Maduro, the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson warned against American intervention and suggested that efforts to oust the Venezuelan dictator were part of—I am not making this up—a “globohomo” conspiracy to bring gay marriage to the country.

The theory of a MAGA rupture over Venezuela has a certain surface plausibility. It’s also completely contradicted by what masses of Trump’s backers are telling pollsters. Two days after the Maduro operation, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 65 percent of Republicans supported it, compared with just 6 percent who didn’t. Another poll, by The Washington Post, pegged that support at 74 percent. And a subsequent YouGov/CBS survey recorded even more striking results: 89 percent of Republicans backed Maduro’s ouster, and for self-described “MAGA Republicans,” the number was 97 percent—a level of enthusiasm that would make even the election-rigging Maduro blush. Days after the Times quoted Bannon fretting about the GOP base’s alleged upset over Venezuela, the paper spoke to its own yearlong panel of Trump backers and reported, with characteristic understatement, that such “skepticism may not be shared by many rank-and-file Republican voters.”

This sequence of events follows a familiar pattern. For months, major media outlets have run story after story about the alleged crack-up of Trump’s MAGA base, sourced to a specific set of elite right-wing influencers. These accounts have been widely shared and celebrated by liberal readers and pundits. And yet for months, that crack-up has failed to meaningfully materialize in polls and focus groups, and the allegations of MAGA infighting have borne little resemblance to the real-world trajectory of conservative politics, where Trump still reigns supreme.

This same pattern—in which so-called Trump influencers asserted a MAGA split where none was actually in evidence, and various news outlets ate it up—was apparent last summer over a different foreign intervention. Before America attacked Iran’s nuclear sites in June, outlets such as Politico hyped a “MAGA civil war” over the prospect. “A strike on the Iranian nuclear sites will almost certainly result in thousands of American deaths,” Carlson claimed. War with Iran, he later added, would amount to a “profound betrayal” of Trump’s supporters and “end his presidency.” Such a conflict would “tear the country apart,” warned Bannon. “MAGA Divide Over Iran Splinters Trump Allies,” declared The Hill. Curt Mills, the anti-interventionist executive director of The American Conservative, told ABC News that the president’s coalition was “revolting to show it’s disgusted with the potential of war with Iran.” That very evening, Trump bombed Iran.

Not only did Trump disregard all of these alleged MAGA thought leaders—so did MAGA voters. YouGov/CBS News found that 85 percent of Republicans backed the strikes, including 94 percent of self-described MAGA Republicans. “While all Republican factions support the airstrikes,” NBC News wrote of its similar survey results, “respondents who identify with the MAGA movement are significantly more supportive of them than those who identify as traditional Republicans.”

The obvious conclusion is this: These purportedly pro-Trump figures do not actually speak for Trump or his supporters. Trumpism is not neo-isolationist or neoconservative, pro-restraint or pro-intervention. It is not pro-worker or pro-billionaire. It is whatever Trump says it is. According to YouGov, two weeks before American forces snatched Maduro, Republican support for invading Venezuela stood at 43 percent. Today that number is 74 percent. “America First” and “Make America Great Again” are slogans, not deeply held governing philosophies. They are branding—and Trump is the brand.

Republican defectors such as the former Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene are often held up as evidence of Trump’s slackening hold on his base. But Greene’s trajectory proves just the opposite. As soon as the president turned on her, her political career became untenable and she quickly announced her departure from Congress. Influencers such as Greene, Bannon, and Carlson present themselves as fighting against out-of-touch elites on behalf of the “America First” masses, but again and again, it is they who have been exposed as elites at odds with the movement they claim to represent. No one has ever spoken for the MAGA coalition other than the man who created it.

Now, it is true that Trump’s overall popularity has been eroding, as my colleague Jonathan Chait recently wrote, but that’s not because he’s losing his base. Rather, it’s because he’s bleeding support among a very different demographic that helped elect him—namely, low-propensity swing voters, especially young men, who backed him because of their concerns about the economy or political correctness. But although the president may be losing these fair-weather friends, the much-larger MAGA movement remains firmly in his corner.

“Let me be very clear: There is no rift in the Republican Party,” said CNN’s chief data analyst, Harry Enten, last week. “Donald Trump has had an iron grip on that Republican base for a long period of time, and it is the same iron grip that he had six months ago,” he continued, pointing to polls showing Trump maintaining an 85 percent approval rating among Republicans despite headlines to the contrary. “Every so often, people are trying to say, ‘Oh, I spot these little rifts in the Republican base. Oh, oh, you know, they’re finally starting to break. They’re starting to break from Donald Trump.’ It ain’t happening.”

None of this is to say that Trump supporters are on board with everything he does. Voters often have things they dislike about their preferred candidate; those things are just not decisive. For years, most Republicans told pollsters that they thought Trump tweeted too much; that didn’t stop them from voting for him or his preferred GOP-primary candidates. Today, most Republicans don’t like how Trump has handled the Epstein files—but most Republicans are not choosing how to vote based on the Epstein files. People tend to make allowances for politicians they like, and Trump has an exceptional instinct for what his supporters actually care about and what they’re willing to overlook, which is why they have stuck with him for more than a decade.

So why do so many reports continue to argue otherwise? The zombie narrative about Trump’s supposedly splintering support has been fueled by a confluence of right-wing, left-wing, and journalistic impulses. Many reporters are drawn to stories of drama and conflict. Many liberals are desperate for signs that Trump’s stranglehold over his base is slipping. And a group of media-savvy right-wing influencers have exploited these desires to promote a story about widespread MAGA discontent that has little basis in fact but that serves their own interests.

And those interests are no longer reliably aligned with Trump’s. As hard-right populists, Bannon and Carlson initially sought to use Trump to advance their own agenda—isolationist abroad, ultranationalist at home, and more overtly anti-Semitic. But as Trump has deviated from that agenda, particularly in foreign affairs, they have begun seeking to supplant him. By weakening the president, they hope to have a say in picking his successor and directing the party after he departs the scene, reshaping the Republican Party more reliably in their image.

To these men, Trump’s sway over the MAGA faithful is an obstacle to be overcome. They are careful not to openly disparage the president himself, in deference to his influence, but their growing animosity has become impossible to miss. In recent months, Bannon has opposed Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy; broken with him on Iran, Venezuela, and support for Israel; and repeatedly called for driving the president’s Big Tech buddies out of the MAGA tent, dubbing Elon Musk and David Sacks “sociopathic overlords in Silicon Valley.” Carlson’s disdain for the president goes way back. “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait,” he messaged his TV producer after the president lost in 2020. “I hate him passionately.”

Add to this the two men’s formidable skill at manipulating traditional and social media—Carlson long served as a source for the liberal press he publicly disdains, and both he and Bannon host popular podcasts that regularly drive online conversation—and the result has been a self-perpetuating cycle in which left-wing wishful thinking meets right-wing opportunism. Carlson and Bannon (and others like them) tell amenable liberals and media outlets what they want to hear; those groups then echo the narrative of MAGA infighting, thereby helping the Trump frenemies inflate their influence and undermine the administration—but by no means furthering the public’s understanding of the actual political dynamics at work.

Carlson, Bannon, and their allies have several more years to chip away at Trump’s standing on the right—and may yet succeed—but they have a very long way to go. Last week, Carlson welcomed James Fishback, a far-right fringe candidate for Florida governor who shares many of Carlson’s views, to his show. “Pretty soon, all winning Republican politicians will talk like this,” Carlson wrote on X when he posted the interview. The same day, a poll of the GOP gubernatorial primary in Florida found that the Trump-backed Representative Byron Donalds was leading Fishback by a healthy 47 percent to 5 percent. But that wasn’t all. “His lead leaps to 76%-6% over Fishback,” reported Florida Phoenix, “when voters are informed about the Trump endorsement.”</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/madeline-cash-lost-lambs-book-review-internet-novel/685595/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The family at the center of Madeline Cash’s first novel, Lost Lambs, is falling apart. Bud and Catherine Flynn have begun a “nonconsensual nonmonogamous spell.” They are too busy scorching each other’s insecurities to cook dinner, more concerned about their own sleeping arrangements than about the eroding bedtimes of their three wayward daughters. Cash’s characters are believable and specific, but contrary to Tolstoy’s famous adage, this unhappy family is, in key respects, like many others. Hemmed in by selfishness, alienation, and subcultural silos, the fracturing Flynns share a kinship with the casts of unhappy-family classics such as Philip Roth’s American Pastoral, Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, and Zadie Smith’s White Teeth. But because Lost Lambs is being published in 2026, its unhappiness derives not from Roth’s “indigenous American berserk,” Franzen’s Y2K anxiety, or Smith’s postcolonial pressure cooker, but from the internet.

Online is where Louise, the Flynns’ middle child, meets an Islamic-fundamentalist user named yourstruly. It’s where Harper, the youngest, researches conspiracy theories involving her father’s shadowy tech-billionaire boss, Paul Alabaster. Online discourse lurks behind even offline behavior—Bud and Catherine’s polyamorous phase; the age-gap dalliance of their eldest daughter, Abigail, with an edgy vet nicknamed War Crimes Wes. In Lost Lambs, the internet sabotages a family in much the same way that Napoleon messes things up for the Bezukhovs in Tolstoy’s War and Peace. This makes Cash’s debut one of the first works—and, let’s hope, not the last—to meld the old genre of the unhappy family with a much younger variety: the internet novel.

The proper internet novel, as I see it, is defined by more than just its subject and setting. These are not books in which the internet is a mere plot device, current event, or academic interest (as in Bruce Holsinger’s Culpability and Dave Eggers’s The Circle). Instead, they are fiction about, and often by, people whose offline life is inextricable from their online presence. These are novels that take seriously, and describe intimately, the impact of living with a smartphone and constant access to social media. Such works do not necessarily focus on the experience of scrolling—although they can, as in Jordan Castro’s The Novelist. But they consider the effect of spending four to six hours a day on the same two or three apps (Instagram, TikTok, X). The supremely disaffected narrator of Anika Jade Levy’s Flat Earth, for example, continually cuts her fingers on the broken screen of her phone.

Cash has a great deal of experience with this kind of writing: For a few years, along with Levy, she edited the buzzy literary journal Forever Magazine. Founded in 2020, Forever was consciously built on “the low quality aesthetic of the early digital age” and during Cash’s tenure it sought out writing that reflected it: dry, glib, generally out of conversation with traditional literature. Cash and her colleagues published authors who might have been deemed too rough, too déclassé, and most of all too terminally online for traditional publications. In one short story by Cash, a character rattles off a list of addled misfits that could double as a list of Forever contributors: “temps, sex workers, Satanists, the young and beautiful, intravenous drug users, the people who stand outside of art galleries, industry plants,” and so on until the list ends, provocatively, with “all the same.” Indeed, in those pages, many writers bear evidence of the same flattening affect, probably because their online experiences—often limited to a few apps—are overwhelmingly alike.

Modern fiction can’t make any valid claim to realism without acknowledging that its characters spend perhaps a quarter of their waking hours online. Yet this presents a dilemma: To depict those hours accurately is to risk overfamiliarity, dullness, and disgust. For many, reading is the ultimate offline activity. An internet novel can feel a bit like a soft-serve machine at the gym.

That’s what makes Lost Lambs distinct among internet novels. The reader spends time with someone else’s family, not someone else’s “For You” page. (Even the presence of a family is a change in the genre, in which parents tend to be offstage, nonspeaking, sending money.) We get to see how conspiracy theories and online strangers and vague ideas about open relationships affect the Flynns without the kind of breathless evocations of internet aesthetics and fussy fictional tweets and Instagram posts that afflict novels such as Lauren Oyler’s Fake Accounts and Patricia Lockwood’s No One Is Talking About This. Cash’s prose style has also become emotionally richer: She’s unlikely ever to sound as sincere as Sally Rooney, but she has evolved beyond the cutting stories in her 2023 short-story collection, Earth Angel. She seems to have found a middle distance between dismissiveness and sentimentality.

In addition to sparing readers a confrontation with the luminous now of the Notification Center, Cash also liberates the Flynns from the always-too-late pop-culture references that constrain many internet novels. Instead of Ritalin or Xanax, Abigail takes “blues,” “yellows,” even “purples” (a risky one—originally “manufactured to bring down the rat population”). Instead of investigating Jeffrey Epstein or Peter Thiel, Harper is obsessed with Alabaster, who has his own sinister quirks. Louise meets her Islamist friend, yourstruly, in a chat room for middle children, not on r/redscarepod. (The book is full of fresh coinages: Page Turner’s bookshop, the British pub Olive or Twist, the ice-cream parlor Anne Frank’s Dairy.) This is a novel about the corrosive effect of modern life that doesn’t feel corrosive. Cash is gentle with us—perhaps too gentle.

In classic novels of family crisis, such as John Updike’s Rabbit, Run and Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road, husbands or wives or children die. Without spoiling too much, there isn’t much to spoil; Lost Lambs has no such mortal stakes. This aversion to physical harm might look at first like fidelity to real life, in which mortal danger is rare. But in Cash’s world, it feels implausible. In the novel’s most preposterous sequence, Bud—who has been continually threatening to kill himself—reveals that he has a long-standing fantasy of being with a woman less attractive than his wife. More head-scratchers follow. Villains, in Cash’s novel, can’t seem to commit to villainy. Irreconcilable differences are resolved by short periods of self-reflection. The overall effect is one of deflation. In the novel, Cash writes: “When a lamb strays, it’s usually lost to wolves, vulnerable without its flock. But sometimes, just sometimes, if it’s lucky, it finds a new one.” That’s not luck—it’s wishful thinking. Cash hasn’t so much tamed the savagery of the internet as turned on parental controls.

Lost Lambs has accomplished something major; it reads to me like the first internet novel with the potential for broad offline appeal. But in joining the Zadie Smiths and Jonathan Franzens of the world, Cash has undermined the tension that makes such novels work. Families can form a strong protective unit, but the price of that bond is that when they fail, they become a grief engine. When a child runs off, when a husband sleeps around, when secrets are whispered or truths shouted, people get hurt in a way they never could have alone. That’s why the stakes in family novels seem so high: because other people get hurt too. Cash flinches from this cascade of consequences.

This is a shame, because a great family novel of the internet would need to take online danger seriously. People really do get lost to conspiracy theories. They get messed up chatting with strangers. The internet has the ability to create assassins and sway elections and destroy families, to waste our time and wreck our life. This is the limitation of Cash’s book, and the lesson for the next novelist who aspires to write a grown-up internet novel: It doesn’t mean anything to be a lost lamb in a world without wolves.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I first heard of Heated Rivalry, I didn’t think much about it. The words Canadian ice-hockey TV series slid into my brain and slipped right back out. But a week later, approximately everyone I’d ever met wanted to talk about it. People kept telling me that it was fun, sweet, and addicting. Most of all, they emphasized that it was really smutty. Every recommendation seemed to come with a warning to not watch with my parents.

The show, which is based on a set of romance novels by Rachel Reid, follows rival hockey stars: Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams), the well-mannered guy next door on Montreal’s team; and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), a cocky bad-boy Russian playing for Boston. They’re supposed to hate each other—but then they start secretly sleeping together, which gets in the way of the animosity a bit. In the past weeks, Heated Rivalry has become an absolute phenomenon. It’s the most-watched original show for the Canadian streamer Crave since the platform launched in 2014, and after HBO Max acquired the series for U.S. viewing, it became the highest-rated live-action show that streamer has obtained since its start, in 2020. Heated Rivalry and the reasons for its success have been dissected at length by culture, “romantasy,” and LGBTQ critics—as well as on major hockey podcasts. At bars across the United States, live watch parties were packed, squeals resounding.

I can’t say for sure why the show caught on so widely. But since the finale aired last month, I’ve been thinking about one element that I really respect: The series knows the value of good sex scenes—not for thrills or laughs or snapshots of a fleeting moment but for illustrating how the characters’ relationship develops, touch by touch, over time. It takes sex seriously in an era when few shows do.

When I first started watching, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t explicit in quite the way I’d imagined. The viewer never sees anything that graphic; there’s no Game of Thrones–style full-frontal nudity, though one does glimpse a generous amount of butt cheek. What feels unique about Heated Rivalry, rather, is that it lets its sex scenes play out, sometimes sticking with its characters nearly from the beginning of their encounter until the end in real time. Even without showing everything, the series communicates the nitty-gritty of what’s going on: which acts, how long they take, who’s leading whom, whether the lovers are gentle or giggly or a little combative and when that tone subtly shifts. Sometimes you hear no music at all, just the sound of kissing or heavy breathing.

So many shows and movies introduce a sex scene only to cut straight to the next morning, imparting merely the understanding that the deed has been done. Even Sex and the City, which was boundary-pushing when it started in 1998, frequently skipped to Carrie Bradshaw smoking a postcoital cigarette, the expression on her face the first clue as to whether the interaction had gone well or not. Sexual specifics, when they were given, were used most often as a punch line. (The guy with “funky spunk,” needless to say, shows up in only one episode.)

The 2010s series Girls did have plentiful sex scenes with unflinching intimate detail—often featuring main characters, revealing something of their relationship. Much of it was horrible sex, though, there to make viewers cackle or cringe. (A 2017 Slate article helpfully ranked all 53 Girls sex scenes by “how Girls it was.” No. 1 features Lena Dunham’s character, Hannah, struggling to get her tights off; her then-situationship Adam, played by Adam Driver, saying he’ll “consider” putting on a condom; and Hannah talking through the act until Adam suggests that they “play the quiet game.”) Many shows seem more comfortable defining what makes sex memorably bad than what makes it great or complicated or mediocre. And a lot of them, romances included, don’t even go that far.

That’s a shame—because for one thing, to put it plainly, a lot of people have sex. When a TV critic once asked Dunham why Hannah was naked so often on Girls, she responded, “It’s a realistic expression of what it’s like to be alive.” And she’s right: Life doesn’t stop happening when clothes come off; it keeps going, and what occurs in that time tends to be pretty important for how a relationship plays out. It’s worth taking a genuine interest in.

A frank sex scene can provide a wealth of information about two characters and the dynamics between them. On Heated Rivalry, Shane and Ilya’s romantic arc builds sporadically over the course of more than eight years. They live in different cities, and they can meet up—briefly and surreptitiously—only when hockey events bring their teams together. But a lot changes with each hookup. Their first time, Shane has never been with a man before, but Ilya has: He leads gently but firmly, with a thumb in Shane’s mouth and then a kiss on his cheek. In a later scene, when the two still-closeted men have been sneaking around for years and are trying to quash the growing feelings they can’t afford to have, the sex is somewhat kinkier but less emotional. (It starts with Ilya ordering Shane around and ends with Shane leaving the hotel confused, drafting a text he never sends: “we didn’t even kiss.”) Near the end of the season, when the two have confessed to falling for each other, one sex scene is particularly playful—it happens while Shane is on the phone—and Williams has said that it was meant to depict the “humor and levity” you might have with someone you’re really comfortable with. If the viewer knew only that sex happened on these occasions, they’d be missing so much of what’s unfolded between Shane and Ilya—especially because these men are extremely bad at talking openly about their situation. “If you skip the sex scenes,” Williams said in one interview, “you miss the story.”

This was all intentional. The show’s intimacy coordinator, Chala Hunter, has said that part of her job was meticulously diagramming each episode in a master spreadsheet to track “the narrative arc that plays out through the intimacy.” She’d regularly check in with Jacob Tierney, the screenwriter and director, to discuss whether a sensual interaction fit the moment: how long the characters had been together, how they’d be feeling emotionally and physically. And even as a professional intimacy coordinator who’s worked on plenty of sets, she found that actually portraying sex rather than “insinuating or implying it” felt new, she told Elle last month: “I was like, Oh, we’re being very specific and fairly explicit here, but to be honest, I found it refreshing and different.”

The fact of Heated Rivalry’s immense popularity suggests that viewers loved it too. That might seem unexpected: Sex has become less and less common on-screen, according to The Ringer’s 2024 analysis of 40,000 films. The same year, The Economist found that sexually explicit content in the 250 highest-grossing U.S. movies had fallen by nearly 40 percent since 2000, while drug references, violence, and profanity had hovered at stable levels. And some surveys have found that audiences have little appetite for sex scenes. In a 2023 UCLA poll, roughly half of 1,500 respondents, ages 13 to 24, said that sex isn’t needed in most shows and movies; more than half said they want more platonic relationships depicted. The next year, the market-research firm Talker Research surveyed 2,000 Americans and found that 43 percent of respondents think sex scenes don’t add to a story; more than 40 percent of the Gen Z participants said they turn a movie off once they hit a sex scene.

Statistics like these have become part of a discussion about whether the culture is growing prudish and puritanical. Some commentators think that young people are not only having less sex but are also less open to sex altogether. (Others argue that they’re so accustomed to porn that media depictions bore in comparison.) When I read those reports, though, what I sense is largely just fatigue: a frustration with a perceived overreliance on romance and the tropes the genre often entails. Many of the UCLA participants agreed that romantic-relationship depictions “often feel unnatural, forced, or toxic.” They were on guard against what they saw as stereotypes, tired of seeing protagonists always end up together and overfull on love triangles.

On the last front, I can’t relate; personally, I want every movie to resemble Challengers. Generally speaking, though, I understand feeling bored with the same old affairs. Especially in straight romances, the signals are so familiar, you can get up to grab popcorn: the shed clothes draped over an armchair, a shirtless man hovering over his lover, feet tangled at the end of the bed. Then it’s morning; the woman is always inexplicably waking up with a shirt on, or rising to grab a robe.

Perhaps Heated Rivalry is a sign that many people are game for sexy content when it’s done creatively or thoughtfully—when it serves a purpose. If audiences haven’t been enjoying sex scenes, well, maybe that’s because most sex scenes haven’t been doing their job.</div>

Other than putting on a spare for a flat tire, what sort of &quot;roadside repairs&quot; are people performing in 2026? There&#39;s not much on any modern car (gas or electric) that can be fixed by the side of the road. It&#39;s not 1965 and you aren&#39;t fiddling with a carburetor anymore.

I thought the same thing, what a bullshit article.

Edmund King, AA president, said: &quot;The AA has the biggest database of EV breakdowns in the UK and our data shows EVs running out of charge is a tiny proportion of EV breakdowns and has fallen dramatically since 2015..

Huh.  So what is it?  Not addressing obvious questions causes speculation.

Typically people don&#39;t run out of charge on the battery. Other than Teslas (which had the stupid habit of not properly powering down and draining the main battery - something which they FINALLY fixed in a software update) cars can happily stand for months on end without losing any charge.

The problem is people run out of charge on the battery... the 12V battery. Some cars for some reason only charge the utility battery from the main battery while the car is driven. I&#39;ve only witnessed a roadside callout for

[EV] cars can happily stand for months on end without losing any charge.Citation? Because my understanding that unless you live in a perfect climate battery still has to be cooled or heated even when the car is parked. That is, generally you can&#39;t leave EV parked and not plugged for any length of time and expect it to still drive when you get back.

Most tow trucks are equipped to handle basic things like giving a jump and/or replacing a 12V battery, and topping up an empty fuel tank but that&#39;s about it.  With an ICE vehicle, that&#39;s the easy stuff and may work.  But if an alternator belt has broken, it&#39;s not getting repaired at road-side.  If a gasket has leaked, nope.  Basically a whole bunch of mechanical stuff... nope. 
But EVs... a large portion of failures are 12V batteries dying.  EVs tend to run all the stuff in the car off that, and charge the 12V from the high-voltage battery.  If your 12V battery dies, more often than not the car is utterly disabled.  You don&#39;t run support stuff off the high-voltage battery.  So... having a replacement or a jump rescues a lot of stuck EVs. 
Point is... complex repairs aren&#39;t happening for ICE, but EVs don&#39;t need as many complex repairs so the rudimentary ones are proportionally more successful.

Other than putting on a spare for a flat tire, what sort of &quot;roadside repairs&quot; are people performing in 2026? There&#39;s not much on any modern car (gas or electric) that can be fixed by the side of the road. It&#39;s not 1965 and you aren&#39;t fiddling with a carburetor anymore.

I&#39;m pretty skilled as an auto mechanic and other than the spare & jack I don&#39;t even bring tools in the car.  I only keep an OBD2 scanner so I can read and clear codes if necessary.  With respect to this EV vs ICE comparison, in the USA EV&#39;s on average are about 3.7 years old, while the average age of all cars is almost 13 years.  So they are comparing roadside issues for relatively new vehicles against much older ones.

And you carry all those parts and tools to affect these repairs?I&#39;ve swapped the alternator on my work van in the parking lot of a 7-11.  Had all the tools with me because... it&#39;s a work van.  Of course, the issue is that you still need someone to bring you the new part.  I&#39;ve joked before that I should keep my e-scooter in my van, so when it breaks down I can take the scooter to the nearest auto parts store.

I&#39;m pretty sure that the vast majority of people reading this are located in the US, with a small chunk of us from Canada as well. And TFA is clearly British, where the market forces, logistics, and demographics are vastly different from those here.

Also, the article is long on claims and short on actual stats and other key details. It strikes me as more of a lazy propaganda piece than a news article.

and it&#39;s also now part of some government plus industry EV marketing effort along with the car dealers industry association and others:

I had two fender benders with two different electric cars. One required a paint job, the other a new fender. Neither had to be recertified.

It&#39;s looking like electric cars or more expensive to maintain than gas cars. Even without including the battery since surprisingly it looks like the batteries will last it&#39;s the rest of the vehicle that&#39;s the problem.Genuinely trying to figure out how you jumped from an article about how it&#39;s easier to repair an EV than ICE on the roadside and made the determination that they&#39;re more expensive to maintain.  Just about everything in the article is indicative of EVs being more reliable, not less.

It&#39;s looking like electric cars or more expensive to maintain than gas cars. Based on what, some anti-EV bullshit you pulled from your arse? The actual data shows the opposite. Consumer reports have largely confirmed that the vast majority of problems experienced by EVs are manufacturing defects which are usually resolved at no cost to the customer. There are the occasional really stupid car designs that give truly boneheadded problems (e.g. the Ford Mustang Mach-E can with minor damage to the undercarriage result in a repair bill in the many thousands due to loss of coolant in the

I also feel like there has to be a selection bias happening right now also where so many electric vehicles are in the luxury class and luxury vehicles have always been expensive to repair.

And you&#39;re spot on with the self inflicted issues, there was a recent story about a Rivian getting dented and the repair was like $30k but it was due to the fact they built something the entire rear half as a single body panel and that had to come off along with a ton of other shit had to get taken apart to get to the prob

I&#39;m aware of literally everything with the ability to recharge a dead EV. You can do that off one of those mobile electric tool batteries you find on worksites. Literally every roadside assistance in western Europe has the ability to get an EV online and fill it with enough charge to get you to a charging station. It&#39;s a matter of time and equipment. If they have a small battery charger that runs from 240V then you&#39;ll be there for an hour. But in many countries if you call and tell them your breakdown issue

And what qualifies as a roadside repair.  Were hybrids included in the EV category?

The article mentions that the AA, which produced the report, has been announced as a new champion of the cross-industry &quot;Electric Cars: The Facts&quot; initiative, a campaign created by Autotrader, ChargeUK and the SMMT. So there is reasonable potential for bias here.  The car industry is not known for being above board and honest with the public.

The phrasing of the central claim seems super odd to me as well:  &quot;AA call-out data ind

There are only two things I can think of as roadside repair issues. A flat tire. Running the battery down on a road trip.

The second is only a worry if I ignore the cars prompts to stop at a charging location. Even then, itâ(TM)s supposedly got a reduced power limping mode if the battery was really low. Iâ(TM)ve yet to experience it.

Most of the repairs I&#39;ve needed on my 2015 Tesla Model S are done at home.  Things like replacing faulty door handles (they finally have a design that doesn&#39;t fail) and other minor but weird things are done at home--Tesla drives out to me.  Same with window replacement.

The only real roadside repairs we&#39;ve had have been for flat tires or a broken axle (massive pothole).  Those usually involve a tow, though we did have Tesla stop by and install a spare replacement wheel and tire for a flat once, which was nic

You still have to wear a fancy helmet. True the new one is higher resolution and more immersive but it is still a helmet. When these things are as small as sunglasses or integrated into contact lenses it will make more sense.

You&#39;ve completely missed the point of the article. Ben Thompson&#39;s problem isn&#39;t with wearing a helmet, it&#39;s with Apple trying to &quot;direct&quot; the immersive basketball experience for him as the viewer. He doesn&#39;t want multi-camera views changed without his input, graphics appearing in his field of vision, or even a play-by-play commentary from an announcer. He wants Apple to get out of the action and let him watch like he&#39;s actually sitting courtside, like he has before in real life. This would arguably be cheap

But the closer the experience comes to actually being there the more I wonder if the cost to the fan will be adjusted to offset an effect on in-person attendance it may cause.They can just either black out dates where attendance is less than 98% or whatever, or charge a premium for home viewing for dates that aren&#39;t sold out.

Tim Cook is at the bed. What does his hand do? What substantial subject matter does it grasp?

I know... I know I&#39;ve let you down. I&#39;ve been a fool to myself.

Operating a virtual computer screen by waving my fingers around seems awful and uselessI sit at the computer when I need to use itI can imagine a device like that might be useful for visualizing a building or large machine made in a CAD systemI can imagine a virtual tour of a city, real or simulatedI can imagine playing a video gameBut operating a computer on a virtual screen? Nope

More than that, if you have created a product that someone has to &quot;understand&quot; for it to be useful, you&#39;ve created a small-market niche product.

If you create a product that is inherently understood by the intended audience, then you have removed a barrier to a sale.

Expecting the entire world to figure out your product and chiding them for not understanding it just means you&#39;ve made a singularly bad user experience that nobody wants to understand, or your marketing people are fucking morons.

It&#39;s hard to be sure, but it looks like he&#39;s saying that Apple actually created the video for the Apple Goggles but don&#39;t realize people wearing Apple Goggles want to be in the game and not jumping around from camera to camera like sports TV.

Apple was providing their own commentary, scores/graphics, and deciding which camera angle the viewer would see as if it was a regular broadcast. Which it is not. Instead of feeling like a floor level seat it is another TV broadcast forcing your perspective.  This adds expense and reduces the being there live experience he wanted. To my understanding this is a specialized broadcast not a TV show being viewed through the headset.

Dammit, not only do I hate agreeing with am abject coward but now I have to wonder what type of asshat does it take to downvote this cowardly but correct statement.

This is a blog post by a child with nothing better to bitch about than an extreme first world problem and yet it somehow made it to /. ?  Must be a paid submission.

I kind of disagree. He seems to be pointing out that when people are watching something in VR they don&#39;t want to be pulled out of it all the time by traditional TV production techniques.

I was watching Dredd 3D in VR last night and that while it was pretty good it would be much better if I could somehow move around and watch the action and wasn&#39;t just watching a 3D movie on a virtual screen in a virtual movie theatre. I don&#39;t see how that could work though, without turning it into something more like a VR ga

Lol your funny I&#39;ve been around /. nearly since the beginning when it was a real news for nerds site and not this thing.

I have a real username and number you can find my real name very easily if you made the slightest attempt, while you hide in shame behind the cowards tag.

Apple announced they were cancelling production of their VR goggles, and as a pressure relief valve to save face, made vague hand-wavey gestures towards using all that R&D money for something in the future.... maybe.
  If you&#39;re still standing up for Apple&#39;s VR ambitions, then you don&#39;t get it - VR has failed as a mainstream product. The same as 3D TV, 3D Blue Ray, etc. There will always be a core audience of VR users but they are vanishingly small, the number of VR headsets manufactured per year i

Oddly enough, VR headsets are the best way I&#39;ve found to watch 3D movies now they&#39;re capable of playing HD videos without losing much (if any) of that resolution.

> There will always be a core audience of VR users but they are vanishingly small, the number of VR headsets manufactured per year is in the 85,000-175,000 range

Quest 3 alone allegedly sells over 1,000,000 a year, though quite a few probably go into the closet after a few weeks. So small, but not vanishingly small.

With traditional approaches, well first you either halve the frame rate or resolution, depending on which technique is in use.

And even the highest end versions tended to have a bit of uncomfortable cross-talk where the wrong side would bleed through because the shutter glasses or the polarization wouldn&#39;t block *all* of the intended other one.  With the VR headsets, you have actual dedicated pixels per eye, so no crosstalk.

Yeah, VR is a bit of a niche, but not under a

3D Blu-Ray uses full HD for each eye, but it&#39;s non-trivial to play 3D Blu-Ray in a VR headset. I think Oculus used to offer 3D videos for rent but that was a long time ago.

As you say, it&#39;s definitely better than our 3D TV because of that lack of cross-talk. But I still sometimes find myself thinking &#39;did I screw up and play the 2D video?&#39; until I see something point out of the screen at me due to the limited 3D effect.

His primary criticism is that there are cuts between cameras. The alternative would be a view from a single place which, even from a courtside seat, isn&#39;t as good a view of the action as you can get from multiple cameras. It might be a realistic experience, but that single point of view would get tiresome pretty quickly.

Perhaps it&#39;s more not liking having the cut happen without having control.  Or maybe the composition, like have a 180 feed and pop up key views on extra screens. Just like how sporting events have big screens for letting the audience get a focused view, but let the &#39;immersive&#39; view remain while you may also use that focused view.

Biggest problem with even the 180 degree view is that the source resolution tends to be rather underwhelming, Even 4k becomes underwhelming when spread across 180 degrees.  Properly

There are many things that could be done with VR to enhance the viewing experience, but no, that&#39;s not the complaint expressed in TFA about how Apple is doing the broadcast.

I think it is, he says point blank he doesn&#39;t like that his perspective keeps getting yanked around without his control.  The counter is &#39;oh but that seat isn&#39;t going to be the best&#39;.  So I&#39;m suggesting a compromise, a selectable &#39;seat&#39; for the basic immersive experience that will not cut unless you explicitly select to do so, and a separate &#39;screen&#39; to provide those curated cuts that you propose are vital to getting to see the action as it moves beyond your ability to reasonably see, just like the &#39;jumbotr

That would probably be great, but Apple could also just let them decide which of the cameras they want to watch from at any moment.

Apple didn&#39;t say this, it was just some asshole calling themselves an &quot;analyst.&quot;

Apple is well aware that the VP is a failure. They&#39;re still going to push ahead though. The first iPhone and iPad were disappointing but it turned them into a trillion dollar company.

There are real uses for VR and particularly AR in industry. For example, I&#39;ve seen a VR app which teaches truck drivers how not to screw up and kill themselves by loading cargo incorrectly, and aircraft manufacturers using an AR headset to show the workers exactly what they&#39;re supposed to do for their work order (so no putting the wrong cables or rivets in the wrong place).

But that&#39;s not as sexy as imagining people walking down the street wearing goggles while posting Twits and seeing everyone&#39;s Twit histor

VR/3D will need a killer app to take off, comparable to spreadsheets launching desktop computers into most businesses.

However, Big Tech has not been good at producing such killer apps. Instead, open-source and standardize the tooling and let tinkerers tinker. Then you have a pool of many thousands of enthusiastic amateurs experimenting and sharing ideas with each other. Eventually killer apps will bubble out from this Lab Of The People.

Meta and Apple should cooperate since if it takes off, both will likely

Corporations have gotten so used to inserting themselves between users / customers and whatever is being purveyed / sold / consumed, that they simply don&#39;t know how to stop. They reflexively manage all kinds of customer experience because they&#39;ve learned - rightly or wrongly - that doing so increases profits, improves their control, and makes customers more reliant on them and more pliable.

I think they simply can&#39;t grasp the idea - no matter how persuasively and vehemently it&#39;s explained - of creating a gre

When fanboys were telling me that all cars would be self-driving by 2020.

This accelerates the timeline to FSD versus the path they were on. They&#39;re going to have better self-driving, just not using the Drive Pilot system. They couldn&#39;t do eyes off in street level driving so easily as on highways. The highway driving experience should be  similar. They are implementing &quot;Level 2++&quot; ... &quot;Drive Pilot Assist&quot;, that brings in street driving not just highways .. and in within a couple of years they will skip level 3 and go directly to level 4.

Nobody outside of Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane said in 2018 that all cars will be FSD by 2020. We already have FSD, ride a Waymo and see for yourself. People misjudged to the time it will take to solve and distribute full self driving. They didn&#39;t misjudge that it could be solved.

Even Tesla, which has the cheapest and fewest sensors possible is almost fully level 4 FSD capable.

> Nobody outside of Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane said in 2018 that all cars will be FSD by 2020.

Fanboys in car forums did. I particularly remembered it because it was so absurd.

Is this another of those &quot;even though you were there and saw it, that definitely couldn&#39;t have happened&quot; things?

Tesla isnt even close to level 4, it can barely manage level 2 sometimes. As for Waymo- sure, on nice wide US streets set out on a grid system. Good luck in london, paris or rome with narrow streets that often only have room for 1 vehicle to pass each way at a time and lots of hand gestures and headlight flashing to indicate intent. Perhaps take a break from the tech bro propaganda occasionally.

Well, there is this one really prolific guy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

e.g. &quot;I consider autonomous driving to be a basically solved problem. ... We&#39;re less than two years away from complete autonomy. Regulators however will take at least another year; they&#39;ll want to see billions of miles of data.&quot; - June 2016

Perhaps none of this long list of quotes is precisely what you were rebuffing.  B

They cited both middling demand and development costs as reasons for killing it.

The problem with Level 3 self-driving is that it&#39;s mostly useless. It can&#39;t control the car in all conditions. It may require the vehicle to navigate to safety and/or return control to the driver. Hardly anyone really wants that. It&#39;s not ubiquitous and reliable. You can&#39;t plan around it.

People really want Level 4, which is fully autonomous driving at human-equivalent levels in all conditions. But that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve.

Meanwhile, you&#39;re dealing with the potential liability from Level 3 self-drive without a huge increase in sales to justify it. This is a classic risk-vs-reward calculation.

I expect Mercedes-Benz to continue working toward Level 4 self-drive, but, personally, I&#39;ve never seen the point of Level 3. I certainly wouldn&#39;t pay for it, and apparently I&#39;m not alone in that respect.

too many unexplained unintended acceleration events, check out some mbeq boards.

Legal costs after it inevitably fucks up at some point.

Anything short of being able to drive me anywhere with full autonomy is more or less useless to me. If I have to pay attention at any point during the drive I might as well just drive myself and save the money for the service.

The benefits of autonomous driving only really come from level 4 or 5. If I can summon my car from across town or sleep in the back during a road trip, that provides real benefits to me as the owner. But sitting in the driver&#39;s seat staring at the road while waiting to take over at a moment&#39;s notice does nothing for me. If I have to be ready to take over, I&#39;d prefer to just drive myself.

Combination of being the worst offender and acquiring new spectrum.

They got a big piece of the 700-MHz band, and in exchange they had to agree to stop being assholes for a while.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?

If allocations were based on the level of ass-hattery, they&#39;d be left with one CB channel.

So, now do they have to give that bandwidth slice back?No, because this is a waiver (not a cancellation of the original agreement).  While it seems that the waiver will be superseded by new rules about unlocking (hint: those new rules are not likely to be especially consumer friendly), it is still possible for some future commission to undo the waiver.

as long as the checks clear the waiver flies.

While I don&#39;t like the whole idea of &quot;locked&quot; phones in the first place, it was ridiculous that Verizon was explicitly singled-out in the regulations.
Well, not really.  Verizon agreed to the quick unlocking as part of their 2007 700MHz spectrum acquisition (and they really wanted that spectrum).

It&#39;s just recisions by another name. Agree to something in principle, then later just don&#39;t do it.

i no longer buy locked phones. In Canada, it&#39;s a bad deal getting the phone from the provider. They charge more than buying it directly.A samsing ffold phone might be 2400$ from samsung. Big telecoms will mark at a price saying it&#39;s 3000$. Then offer to lease it to you for 1500$ for two years, and you have to give it back, or pay the full 3000$. Also you&#39;re locked to a shitty expensive plan during that time.

They have gone directly to a two tier attack 1. Lock you to bad plan for 2 years. 2. Strictly do a se

So...much...WINNING!!
Hate to admin this, but he was right; I am tired of all the winning. /s

Verizon only has to comply with the CTIA trade group&#39;s voluntary unlocking policy.

This only means the companies must make the required contributions to el Bunko and THEN write the policy for the FCC to rubber stamp. The Chair-Widget has a large Rubber Stamp (with the Extra Large Ink Reservoir) in his first desk drawer for such occasions. There are extra pads in the second drawer for when the pads get worn down.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s campaign to punish Sen. Mark Kelly—a retired Navy captain—for urging members of the armed forces to disobey unlawful orders, is even more outlandish, and legally baseless, than it seems at first glance.

This past November, in a 90-second video addressed to service members, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had served in the military or in intelligence agencies stated that the Constitution was under threat from abroad and here at home, and that “our laws are clear—you can refuse illegal orders. … You must refuse illegal orders.”

The video failed to mention President Donald Trump’s name or any of his policies, but in the wake of military actions and threats he was making at the time, especially toward Venezuela, the message was clear.

In response, Trump denounced the video as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS … punishable by DEATH!” He added, a bit later, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!”

Hegseth characteristically chimed in with his own denunciations and, last week, issued a formal letter of censure, which could lead to a demotion of Kelly’s rank, reducing his benefits. Kelly could even be recalled to active duty, then court-martialed, an act that would remove his military status entirely and even land the senator in prison.

On Monday, Kelly filed a lawsuit against Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy, claiming that they were trying to deny his constitutional rights and requesting a federal judge to block them from carrying out their threats.

Kelly’s case seems to be a slam dunk. Even if the judge allows Hegseth and Phelan to pursue their censure, it is extremely unlikely—though I hesitate to say impossible, because nothing is impossible with this administration—that the senator’s persecutors will succeed.

First, and most obviously, the notion that Kelly and his colleagues committed sedition, treason, or any sort of crime with their video is preposterous. They were not encouraging service members to defy specific orders—only reminding them that they are obligated not to follow unlawful orders. In this, the lawmakers were merely reciting the clear language of military law.

Second, even if this were seditious (or even if Kelly had made some truly treasonous remark), retired officers cannot be demoted for things they say or do after they retire. “The statutes on this are absolutely clear,” Eugene Fidell, a senior scholar specializing in military law at Yale Law School, told me on Tuesday. (Retired officers can be demoted for things they had said or done on active duty, but no one is even pretending that Kelly’s record as a Navy pilot was anything but salutary.)

Third, retired officers can be court-martialed for sedition. If found guilty, they could be stripped of all military rank or even imprisoned. However, a court-martial would require a trial in a military court, with the prosecutors presenting evidence of criminality. Even Hegseth must realize that the more hard-line military court would likely dismiss a case based on a video in which Kelly recites a fundamental plank of military law.

Could Hegseth just go ahead and sign an order demoting Kelly and docking his retirement pay? Actually, no. According to Fidell, the secretary of defense has the authority to demote only flag officers—that is, generals and admirals. Kelly’s rank of captain, the highest of the U.S. Navy’s senior officers, is one notch below rear admiral, the lowest-ranking flag officer.

However, Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, could sign such an order. If he did, Fidell told me, Kelly could sue him in federal claims court—and very likely succeed at getting his pay restored and making the Pentagon’s civilian leaders look appallingly petty. The consequences could be deeply demoralizing, within the Pentagon and at U.S. military bases (not that this possibility has deterred Hegseth from his antics so far).

Kelly sees what’s really going on here. In a statement released while filing his lawsuit, Kelly said that Hegseth’s “unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military: If you speak out and say something that the president or secretary of defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.” He added, “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

Actually, this does seem to be the way things work in the United States of America now. I know of a few officers who are hesitant to speak out against Trump or his policies precisely because they fear retribution—and lack the access to resources, high profile, and legal protections that Kelly enjoys as a member of Congress. There is also a disposition among many officers, bred in them from their days as cadets, to steer clear of political activity, even if it’s meant to protest the politicization of the military.

Still, there are rumblings of change. Kelly’s suit is one. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s video pushback against the Trump Justice Department’s criminal investigation is another. The votes of a few (remarkably few, but still a few) Republican lawmakers—voicing new dissent against Trump’s war-making powers in Venezuela, his imperial threats against Greenland, and even his desire to kill Obamacare—may be more wavelets in a turning tide.

Meanwhile, the crusade against Captain Kelly seems doomed to a proper flameout.

It was the most unlikely response to the widely expected overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the summer of 2021, a small group of about 12 individuals, including some health care workers, elected officials, and local community activists, in the deep-red state of Wyoming—which didn’t have a single abortion clinic at the time—began planning to open a new clinic in the college town of Casper. This was at the same time that most abortion clinics in red states, seeing the writing on the wall, had begun planning to close or move to a more hospitable location. But not in Wyoming.

And this long-shot gamble paid off. Wellspring Health Access, which provides abortions as well as other services including family planning, general gynecology, and gender affirming care, opened its doors in spring 2023, almost a year after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Since then, the clinic has faced unending legal challenges from the state. However, at each turn, the clinic has prevailed, culminating in a big win before the Wyoming Supreme Court last week. This ruling, which may have significance for abortion rights beyond Wyoming, struck down the state’s general abortion ban as well as a specific ban on mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.

How did this implausible turn of events come to pass? Beyond the determination of the community group in Casper, two main factors explain the ultimate success of this venture: Wyoming’s unique libertarian constitution and the savvy and determination of a woman named Julie Burkhart. In a wonderful instance of karma, the famously libertarian citizens of Wyoming, enraged by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, aka “Obamacare,” in 2010, amended their constitution, stipulating that individuals have the right to make their own health care decisions. This amendment became the heart of the legal strategy used by the would-be clinic’s lawyers, and this argument ultimately prevailed.

But there needed to be someone to use that constitutional provision, and that’s where Julie Burkhart came in. Julie is a longtime, well-known figure in abortion-providing circles. She is not a clinician, but rather an abortion access strategist and a skillful clinic operator who has a track record of opening abortion facilities in hostile and underserved areas. It was this reputation that led the Casper group to invite her to work with them even when Roe was about to be overturned.

Julie’s involvement with abortion care began in 2001, when she began work with Dr. George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was assassinated in 2009 in his church by an anti-abortion fanatic. Tiller’s mentorship was deeply influential for Julie, and she has worked in the abortion field since his death. She purchased his Wichita clinic from his widow and reestablished abortion there, a city that had been left without such care after Tiller’s death. She also went on to open a clinic in Oklahoma, as well as several other places.

As part of a book project on how people in various sectors of the abortion-providing community were preparing for and then responding to the Dobbs, we interviewed Julie three times over the course of 2022. These interviews took place at the very beginning of that year, immediately after the decision was announced in June, and finally at the end of 2022.

Our first interview with Julie, in January 2022, took place while she and her Casper allies were already actively planning how to move forward with an abortion clinic. A lucky break occurred, she told us, when a wealthy donor purchased a facility from a medical practice that had closed and donated it to the group. This purchase was especially fortuitous as the facility was in an area already zoned to permit a medical clinic.

Finding a contractor to upgrade the clinic for abortion services was a challenge, though. Abortion providers have long faced difficulties finding people willing to work with them. Even if the individual workers involved are not opposed to abortion, they often have realistic fears of being targeted by anti-abortion forces and being subjected to boycotts. Julie did manage to convince a local contractor to do the necessary work, vaguely telling him the clinic was for a “women’s health center.” The contractor did eventually learn the intended purpose of the facility, but continued to do the work, and tellingly, did not post a sign on the site giving the name of his company, as is normally done.

Julie’s fervent hope was to open the clinic about a month before Dobbs was expected to be announced, on the theory that since the clinic would offer a range of services, it could not be shut down, even if providing abortions was no longer legal in the state. As she put it, “So if something does happen in Wyoming, we will have that presence. We will have community ties. We will have standing if we have to go to court.”

But this hope of a pre-Dobbs opening was dashed in May 2022 when Julie awoke to a phone call informing her that the nearly finished clinic had been firebombed. Upon going to the clinic, she learned that most of the building would need to be gutted and rebuilt. The arsonist was eventually caught, but this set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

The summer of 2022 got even worse weeks later with the announcement of the Dobbs decision. When we spoke to her shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Julie was predictably devastated. “I was so angry, so hurt,” she said. Julie spent the day after the decision listening to music at very high volume—including old feminist anthems from the 1970s. But neither the firebombing, the Dobbs decision, nor the Wyoming Legislature’s vote to ban abortion, if the Supreme Court allowed it to do so, broke her and caused her to retreat. As she said to us with more passion in her voice than in previous conversations, “I want to tell you, in Wyoming, we are going to litigate; we are going to fight this thing to the end.”

Finding legal representation proved yet another challenge. Several national legal groups who represented abortion clinics, while very supportive of the idea of a new clinic in Wyoming, were reluctant to get involved, feeling that the aspiration was unrealistic and that their limited resources in the face of a hostile U.S. Supreme Court were better spent elsewhere. But Julie and her comrades finally located local lawyers willing to represent them. Together, they promptly seized the above-mentioned constitutional amendment as their core legal argument.

This strategy quickly paid off. Several lower court victories allowed the clinic to open in 2023, when it began serving not only people in Wyoming but also those from surrounding states which have banned abortion. Julie has since told us there has been both community support and opposition to the clinic. Tellingly in this era of anti-trans sentiment, in some instances, the hostility is as much about the clinic’s provision of gender-affirming care as about abortion.

With the resounding victory from the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, Julie was celebratory when we emailed with her. However, nothing is “over” when it comes to abortion conflicts, especially in a place like Wyoming. In response to the decision, the state’s governor has called for a ballot measure in the 2026 election to amend the state constitution to ban abortion. These kinds of measures since Dobbs have mostly supported the pro-choice position, even in red states. It is unclear how the vote would go in Wyoming, if indeed it is on the ballot. If the measure is before the voters, it is clear that Julie and the Casper community will be actively helping to defeat it.

It’s perhaps inevitable that there are already several online fundraisers for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week. Conservative social media users often rally to financially defend anyone perceived as a member of their team, regardless of how unpalatable their actions might be. One GoFundMe for the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has already raised more than $439,000, $10,000 of which came from the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who argued that everyone deserves a hearty defense.

But there was one specific fundraiser that betrayed just how careless the right has become in its tribalist impulses. On GiveSendGo, the “Christian” alternative to GoFundMe, the primary fundraising post for Ross is explicitly white supremacist in nature.

GiveSendGo was built as a kind of conservative, faith-based alternative to GoFundMe, and it has crowdfunded small fortunes for plenty of conservative heroes accused of violent or bigoted actions. For example, it hosted a campaign that raised $836,000 for Shiloh Hendrix, the white mother who called a child on a playground the N-word. It is also where Kyle Rittenhouse raised more than $586,000 for his defense after he killed two men in 2020. Many Jan. 6 insurrectionists—even those who assaulted police officers in their efforts to overturn the election—turned to this platform when they wanted help.

But the site’s Ross fundraiser, which has raised more than $171,000, reveals an even darker side of these crowdfunding efforts.

Titled “Stand With Our Brave ICE Hero,” the fundraiser is a legitimate campaign connected to the agent. It has been shared by Jacob Wells, a co-founder of GiveSendGo, who has personally vouched, on social media, that the funds will go to Ross. It was boosted by major conservative accounts, as well as the right-wing news outlet Alpha News, which was the first publication to share video from Ross’ perspective of the Minneapolis encounter.

But skim to the third paragraph of its description of the event, and you’ll see—or would have seen, as the page has since been edited—a rather odd description of the situation: “This didn’t happen in a vacuum—it’s the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish) fanning the flames of resistance.”

In case that reference to Frey’s religion isn’t enough, there are other tells about this particular fundraiser’s specific white supremacist leanings. The fundraiser’s URL is www.givesendgo.com/Theyallmustgo. Then there’s the opener, addressing “America First patriots”—a signal, often, to the more white supremacist element of the right. The text also speaks of “illegal aliens … flooding our nation … and threatening our sovereignty” and of efforts to “purge … parasites from our soil,” dehumanizing rhetoric that evokes Great Replacement conspiracy theories.

But we don’t actually need to decipher the language here, because the man who created the account is an avowed white supremacist who has no desire to hide his views. On X, the man—who goes by Tom Hennessey, it’s unclear if that is his real name—defended the killing by asking if Good was a “negrophile” and arguing that “American stormtroopers … should be able to use extraordinary violence on our behalf.” He celebrates whiteness on his account, argues for the protection of “White American bloodlines,” and promotes the idea that Jews ruin white nations by “flooding” them with immigrants.

It’s not clear if he has any direct connection to Ross, but this isn’t his first fundraiser. In November, Hennessey set up a GoFundMe page for a 20-year-old Mississippi State University student who yelled “Fuck the Jews” at Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. (The page said that Jewish complaints about “hate speech” were weaponized to get “the goyim get locked up.”) And in December, Hennessey set up another page, this time for Crystal Wilsey, a woman who repeatedly used the N-word at a Somali American couple and declared herself to be “a racist.” In fact, the ICE agent page was admittedly out of character for Hennessey, as it didn’t involve an explicitly racist incident. But it did establish this as, at minimum, a hobby for him.

The people who donated to this GoFundMe, or those who just expressed interest, such as Megyn Kelly, may not have all read the page or clocked its white supremacist origins. It has since been edited to remove the reference to Frey’s Judaism; it has not been toned down that much overall. But this incident shows the carelessness behind right-wing solidarity. Ross’ supporters, acting on a kind of anti-left impulse, may think they’re helping their movement by supporting patriots. They are also exposing overt hatred at the core of the anti-immigrant movement.

By now, the footage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Minneapolis mom of three Renee Nicole Good has been pored over and dissected frame by frame. When Good tried to drive away from her otherwise anemic standoff with ICE, Ross shot her in the face. Good was barred from receiving medical aid for 15 minutes. It’s all pretty grisly, and it’s increasingly mundane. Already this year, the agency has killed two people. Last year, its most fatal year since 2004, it killed 32. That’s one reason it feels as if Ross could get away with this, a murder, entirely without consequence. ICE has always seemed to operate with impunity, even before this particular administration, and the federal probe into Good’s killing is starting to impede the state investigation.

But on Friday night, a new angle emerged—cellphone footage from Ross himself. In it, more realities of the killing are clarified: Good wasn’t antagonizing the agent, and she had turned her wheels not to try to hit him but instead to drive away slowly. Most telling are Ross’ final words, after he shoots Good but before he stops recording. As her van drifts off, Good soon to be dead in the driver’s seat, he mutters, “Fucking bitch,” mostly to himself.

I know, I know: Who gives a shit about mere words when he literally murdered a woman in the street? On camera, in front of witnesses? With the president defending his every move? It’s almost farcical to care. But to call Good a “fucking bitch”—after he already shot her—still tells us plenty about what Donald Trump and his soldiers think about the rest of us. It also shows us plenty about where we’ve come as a society in this decade of MAGA. Trump often speaks about women as disposable. One of the first times the president showed us he plays by a different set of rules was when he bounced back after being caught on a hot mic talking to Billy Bush about how he could “grab [women] by the pussy.”

The snarl of Ross calling Good a “fucking bitch” is familiar in the way any garden-variety misogynistic comment is to most women. He said it after he shot her, after it was clear she would be grievously injured at best and dead at worst. It was adding literal insult to injury, an aside meant mostly for himself, to shore him up as the big man who won the fight with this small girl. It wasn’t enough to just kill her—he had to insult her in a uniquely female way too. Ross could have called her a fucking asshole. A piece of shit. A member of Hamas! There was plenty of incendiary invective for Ross to pull from. He chose to call Good a bitch because it’s what men call us all the time. It was easy, and lazy.

Agents like Ross resent women like Good because they don’t give a shit about his authority. (Her evident queerness wasn’t likely to help either.) She was behaving the way we want our mothers to behave—protective, strong—and the way we need white women to act, getting in between the most vulnerable people in their communities and the forces trying to hurt them. She was punished for it in a few ways.

Good’s final sentences to the ICE agent were telling too: “I’m not mad at you.” On paper, this seems like the exact right way to de-escalate a hostile conversation with a police officer; in reality, it’s that kind of dismissal that likely pissed Ross off so much in the first place. The fear is part of the point for ICE; why else would its members hunt mothers down in front of day cares, taking children out of their arms?

Good refused to give ICE any of her fear, up until the very end. Her plan was to drive away calmly, moving like someone who wasn’t afraid of the big bad wolf trying to scare her on her block. Maybe she would have had a better chance if she had showed him she was afraid; he could have retained some agency over her. But for her to drive away, a smile on her face? That’s something only a fucking bitch would do.

One thing this Trump administration has given us, especially post-COVID, is the unvarnished truth of how mean everything is. The Obama administration deported people en masse too. There have always been murders at the hands of the police. But Trump’s version of law and order is so brazenly cruel, so demonstratively evil, that it at least makes it easier to point at, clearer to define. What Good’s murder clarifies for us, among other brutalities, is that the administration and the army it has deployed have categorized the people who live in this country in tidy boxes. Those boxes are labeled with slurs.

God, how low we’ve sunk. At least when Trump was boasting about grabbing women by the pussy, he was doing it behind closed doors. Back then, he knew he had to eke out a mealymouthed apology for the sake of decorum. Now any pretense of such decorum is gone—the uberrich, like Bill Ackman, are helping fund the next act of a guy who killed a woman in her family van. Is it still locker-room talk if they say it to our faces, gun cocked? Never mind that the political and media figures who publicly mourned Charlie Kirk and denounced his public execution have been largely silent about Good’s death. That hypocrisy is obvious, even if it’s still devastating.

This week, there will continue to be countless attempts to justify what Ross said. Words are not actions. He was afraid she was going to hit him with her van. She should have gotten out of the car. Nothing matters except this: Ross called Good a fucking bitch because it’s what he thinks of her. It’s what guys like Ross think about all of us. It’s just that now guys like Ross, and guys like a president, feel free to say it out loud. What a relief, in a way, to hear it stated so plainly.

            <div id="article-text">The following essay is excerpted from The Pain Brokers: How Con Men, Call Centers, and Rogue Doctors Fuel America’s Lawsuit Factory, published by Atria/One Signal Publishers on Tuesday.

In the fall of 2015, a horde of lawyers from across the country descended on Las Vegas and beelined for the Bellagio Resort and Casino. They weren’t in town to hear Britney Spears, immerse themselves in the Strip’s glitz and glamour, or answer the siren call of the blackjack tables. But they did harbor gamblers’ get-rich goals.

The draw: a conference called “Mass Torts Made Perfect,” held in the hotel’s grand ballroom, tucked well behind its famous musical water fountain. It was the nation’s largest gathering of attorneys who represent groups of people injured—or killed—by exposure to products like opioids or asbestos.

Some of the attorneys, the insiders, were already rich beyond imagining. Others, like the Elvis impersonators roaming the streets, were wannabes, eager to tap into the mass tort gold mine.

A mass tort is personal-injury litigation on steroids. It’s not just one fender-bender victim with whiplash out for a few thousand bucks. Nor is it a class action over $3 ATM fees that alerts consumers via junk mail. It’s hundreds, thousands, and sometimes more than 100,000 people suing over life-changing physical harm from asbestos-laced baby powder, from NFL concussions, from pacemakers, hip implants, and other medical products.

Ordinarily, plaintiffs expect to file a lawsuit and have a suit-and-tie lawyer usher them through to trial, where they can tell the jury how corporate wrongdoing wrecked their health. But in mass torts, a panel of seven judges decides which federal judge will handle all federal lawsuits with similar facts. Then injured plaintiffs from Alaska to Maine find their cases shipped off to a single judge somewhere in the United States through a process known as multidistrict litigation. With thousands of cases mushed into a scrum, trials disappear and individuals become numbers on a spreadsheet.

At the center of these mass tort cases are real people seeking justice from large corporations. None of those people was in Las Vegas. This gathering was for their lawyers, who paid $1,495 each to attend. This event was about money and power.

Outside the Bellagio’s grand ballroom, three men registered for the conference. They’d jetted in on separate planes, lest one go down. Nine seasoned “spokesmodels” in electric-blue dresses sashayed around them in the hallway like roving disco balls.

“Come party with us tonight,” the women said, handing out embossed invitations to passing lawyers.

“They can’t do that,” snapped the woman behind the makeshift registration desk. “That’s like free advertising.”

With a snort, the youngest of the three men peeled off $10,000 in cash, slapped it on the desk, and registered the strippers too.

The evening’s party hosts were Vincent Chhabra, his son and front man Michael, and Ron Lasorsa, principals in a company called Alpha Law LLC.

Though Alpha Law was billed as a law firm, Vince, Michael, and Ron weren’t lawyers, and their company was not a law firm in the usual sense. They were entrepreneurs who ran a call center that generated client leads. Their Florida-based business raised the hopes of women who’d been hurt, added their names to a giant database of “clients,” then collaborated with real lawyers willing to pay for the clients’ names—and to fork over 85 percent of their attorneys fees to Alpha Law, their new “co-counsel,” if they settled the cases.

Vincent was a first-generation Indian immigrant and dot-com whiz kid. His early online pill mill had led to prison time, which got extended for running an online puppy scam. Out for a few years, he ventured into call centers that targeted women injured by pelvic mesh, a device intended to stabilize sagging organs and cure incontinence but which left many women in diapers and debilitating pain.

Ron, a New Yorker from Long Island, was Vince’s stocky, tattooed business partner. He’d been a company commander at the Marine Corps School of Infantry, gone bald after two tours of duty in Kuwait, and done a long stint on Wall Street before getting fired, filing for divorce, and discovering mass torts.

Rounding out the trio was Michael, the 20-year-old son Vince had been grooming to take over the business since he was 6. At 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, Michael was still growing into his lanky frame and taking classes at Ohio State. He looked nothing like his dad; he had light skin and blue eyes and was 6 inches taller.

That night, in one of the Bellagio’s opulent suites, the three celebrated with a lavish house party. Just months before, they had sold the names of 14,000 clients to a Texas law firm for $40 million. Those clients were mostly women injured by pelvic mesh. And despite the sale, the trio had no intention of exiting the business.

Music pulsed as lawyers crammed into the suite to ogle the performing strippers. Some elbowed their way closer, others puffed on cigars or weed, and a chosen few leaned back to enjoy lap dances—plus less stand-up activities. Glasses filled with amber liquor, neat, clinked and sloshed onto the billiard table. Late into the night, the guys draped themselves with barely clad women in a photo booth, memorializing the moment. Remnants of white powder stuck to tabletops and bathroom counters. And mobile IV hydration stations stood ready to serve cocktails of vitamins, amino acids, and anti-nausea meds to take the edge off in the morning.

The music, the women, the open bar, the outfits—Armani meets Miami Vice—gave the soiree a Wolf of Wall Street vibe. The details of that night in 2015 vary depending on whom you ask. Someone photographed prominent attorney partygoers in the act and “basically blackmailed” them into payoffs or future business deals. Whether the women or the Chhabras sprang the honey trap was never clear.

The next day at the pool, which had a golden fountain spouting from the middle, was a scene straight out of Animal House: Polo club lawyers sipped bloody marys and mimosas on one side, and the Alpha Law crew wrestled like bawdy Delta House frat bros on the other.

Led by “Savage,” a tough blonde, nine women clad in acid-blue bikinis and stilettos paraded through the Bellagio’s corridors. Advertising Alpha Law, they coaxed male lawyers to the rowdy poolside cabana.

Mike Papantonio was among the invited conference-goers. Pap, as he liked to be called, presided as master of ceremonies. His law firm had invented “Mass Torts Made Perfect” and ran it as a conference for elite plaintiffs’ attorneys nationwide to rub elbows and strategize, making him the unofficial president of the polo club posse. Even as the upper crust regarded Alpha Law’s members as parasites, some of the elite in pelvic-mesh multidistrict-litigation leadership positions profited handily from their efforts.

Pap was surely not amused by Savage’s party; he’d already gotten an earful about the previous night’s shenanigans. He sent out a reproachful email saying everything and nothing at the same time: “A group of individuals … were involved during the seminar in business practices that we do not condone and will not tolerate.” Above the Law, a clever, classed-up National Enquirer for lawyers, filed it under “Conferences/sex” and mused, “Jesus, why don’t we go to these seminars?”

Ron, Vincent, and Michael, however, were on top of the world, the new fat cats on the rise. All the lights of Las Vegas, from Planet Hollywood to Caesars Palace, lay at their feet.

The Bellagio’s grand ballroom felt much like its casino—ornate, windowless, sour with old cigarette smoke. Mike Papantonio strutted on a raised stage, his own face a hundred times larger than life on the screen behind him. With the gestures, voice, and pomaded hair of a televangelist, he introduced a panel of mostly white men in suits, a few female lawyers defending medical device manufacturers, and two illustrious senior federal judges wrangling big cases.

Oblivious to the evening and poolside shenanigans, I sat about halfway back, embedded in a sea of plaintiffs’ lawyers who routinely earn more on a single mass tort deal than I’d take home in 15 years as a law professor. I’d long made noises about lawyers’ self-dealing—the stuff professors complain about over craft beer. I’d been invited to speak because I’m a national expert on mass torts, but no one really wanted me there. It was the inner circle, a cabal I’d tried to disband for more than a decade. Fighting nerves about my upcoming panel, I saw a text light up my phone. It was my boss, the law school dean. “How’s Vegas?” he asked. “SEAL Team Six on standby.”

I was about to repeat a presentation I had given the previous week at Duke Law School, where I highlighted the astronomical sums awarded to a handful of lawyers chosen to lead mass tort cases by a good-old-boy network. That practice, I argued, enriched everyone except their clients, the regular citizens who suffered the actual harm. My remarks moved an apoplectic plaintiff’s lawyer to point across the room at his opposing counsel, leer in my direction, and ask, “So are you accusing me of colluding with him?”

I never used the word collude. “Just curious about these numbers,” I said.

That lawyer was one of eight attorneys who’d led a massive multidistrict lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Propulsid, an acid-reflux drug popular in the 1990s whose side effects allegedly included deadly cardiac abnormalities. I’d unearthed plenty about the business side of this famous case that they’d all have preferred to keep buried.

Lawyers claimed that the Propulsid settlements were worth between $84 million and $105 million total. But most plaintiffs—99.4 percent—got nothing. Only 37 of 6,012 plaintiffs received anything, and collectively it was less than $6.5 million. Lead attorneys like the red-faced lawyer had made money not only by settling their own clients’ cases but by spearheading the lawsuit. For that work, defendant Johnson & Johnson paid them—the plaintiffs’ lawyers (!)—a whopping $27 million.

How could the injured get so little while their lawyers purchased private jets?

Now, surrounded by the Moulin Rouge feel of the Bellagio, I made my way up to the dais and laid out those damning numbers in the lawyers’ den, where I was the only thing standing between them and lunch with legendary running back Emmitt Smith.

But nothing would change. The status quo benefited the key stakeholders: The in crowd of plaintiffs’ attorneys got richer. Corporate defendants found settlements cheaper by the thousand. And judges received accolades when massive cases settled quickly—despite secret terms that typically made the money impossible to follow.

Plaintiffs were the ones who suffered. I knew because I’d spoken with them when their lawyers had not.

Afterward, those titans of tort seemed to have retained only one thing: that they were ranked on a list of lawyers chosen to command these cases. Never mind that it was a roster of the infamous, not the famous.

I wandered next door into the exhibit hall, where rows of tables were strapped with plastic banners and heaped with leaflets, mints, lens cleaners, highlighters, and tote bags. Herds of plaintiffs’ lawyers in suits, buttoned-down polo shirts, and the occasional high heels meandered past vendor booths hawking services for everything from medical records retrieval and client ads to law firm loans and settlement administration.

Those were the invisible hands greasing the wheels of mass torts, hands that propelled injured people through a maze they knew nothing about. I’d written about the industry for well over a decade, but I had no idea how vast it was until I saw its inner workings on display. Only much later would I realize that it wasn’t so much a smorgasbord of vendors as it was the Gorgon Medusa: When one head is removed, more sprout in its place.

Later, in the airport terminal, a slim, silver-haired conference attendee confirmed the snippets of hushed chatter I’d overheard in the Bellagio’s hallways. Something darker than lawyers’ self-dealing was stirring, and it involved pelvic mesh. An estimated 10 million women worldwide have pelvic mesh in their bodies, and hundreds of thousands of them were suing. The case would be bigger than the BP oil spill and Vioxx combined. Once the leviathan of profit for companies like Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific, pelvic mesh was now the white whale of liability for mass tort plaintiffs’ attorneys.

Pelvic mesh settlements were expected to total $11 billion, and everyone in the industry wanted a piece. Lead attorneys would receive $366 million of that in common-benefit fees for their work on behalf of all plaintiffs. With each plaintiff’s contingent fees ranging from 33 to 45 percent, non-lead lawyers would net between $3.63 billion and $4.95 billion, excluding costs. (As costs, one attorney charged a mesh client $575 for his steak dinner, $5,000 for his private plane, and $6,630 in interest.)

And the injured women? Their settlements would average $40,000 before fees and costs.

Though I’d escaped Las Vegas without needing a SEAL Team Six rescue, I soon found myself submerged in the legal system’s gritty underbelly, tracking a network of con men, bankrupt surgeons, chiropractors, medical funders, and lawyers who yearned to be insiders—all of them willing to do anything for a buck.

In that legal netherworld, women weren’t just plaintiffs. They were cash machines.

            <h2>Popular Python libraries used in Hugging Face models subject to poisoned metadata attack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/ai_python_library_bugs_allow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vulnerabilities in popular AI and ML Python libraries used in Hugging Face models with tens of millions of downloads allow remote attackers to hide malicious code in metadata. The code then executes automatically when a file containing the poisoned metadata is loaded.

The open source libraries - NeMo, Uni2TS, and FlexTok - were created by Nvidia, Salesforce, and Apple working with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology&#39;s Visual Intelligence and Learning Lab (EPFL VILAB), respectively.

All three libraries use Hydra, another Python library maintained by Meta and commonly used as a configuration management tool for machine learning projects. Specifically, the vulnerabilities involve Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function.

Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 spotted the security flaws and reported them to the libraries&#39; maintainers, who have since issued security warnings, fixes and, in two cases, CVEs. While the threat hunters say they haven&#39;t seen any in-the-wild abuse of these vulnerabilities to date, &quot;there is ample opportunity for attackers to leverage them.&quot;

&quot;It is common for developers to create their own variations of state-of-the-art models with different fine-tunings and quantizations, often from researchers unaffiliated with any reputable institution,&quot; Unit 42 malware research engineer Curtis Carmony wrote in a Tuesday analysis. &quot;Attackers would just need to create a modification of an existing popular model, with either a real or claimed benefit, and then add malicious metadata.&quot;

Plus, Hugging Face doesn&#39;t make the metadata contents as easily accessible as it does with other files, nor does it flag files using its safetensors or NeMo file formats as potentially unsafe.

Models on Hugging Face use more than 100 different Python libraries, and almost 50 of these use Hydra. &quot;While these formats on their own may be secure, there is a very large attack surface in the code that consumes them,&quot; Carmony wrote.

The Register reached out to Hugging Face along with the libraries&#39; maintainers (Meta, Nvidia, Salesforce, and Apple), and only received one response. It came from a Salesforce spokesperson who told us: &quot;We proactively remediated the issue in July 2025 and have no evidence of unauthorized access to customer data.&quot;

We will update this story if we hear back from any of the other companies.

As mentioned earlier, the vulnerabilities have to do with the way the  NeMo, Uni2TS, and FlexTok use the hydra.utils.instantiate() function to load configurations from model metadata, which allows for remote code execution (RCE).

The creators or maintainers of these libraries appear to have overlooked the fact instantiate() doesn&#39;t just accept the name of classes to instantiate. It also takes the name of any callable and passes it the provided arguments.

By leveraging this, an attacker can more easily achieve RCE using built-in Python functions like eval() and os.system().

Meta has since updated Hydra&#39;s documentation with a warning that states RCE is possible when using instantiate() and urges users to add a block-list mechanism that compares the  the _target_ value against a list of dangerous functions before it is called. As of now, however, the block-list mechanism hasn&#39;t been made available in a Hydra release.

Here&#39;s a closer look at three of the AI/ML libraries that use Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function and the related vulnerabilities.

NeMo is a PyTorch-based framework that Nvidia created in 2019. Its .nemo and .qnemo file extensions - TAR files containing a model_config.yaml file - store model metadata along with a .pt file or a .safetensors file, respectively.

The problem here is that the metadata isn&#39;t sanitized before these NeMo files make an API call to hydra.utils.instantiate(), and this allows an attacker to load .nemo files with maliciously crafted metadata, trigger the vulnerability, and achieve RCE or tamper with data.

Nvidia issued CVE-2025-23304 to track the high-severity bug and released a fix in NeMo version 2.3.2

NeMo also integrates with Hugging Face, and an attacker could follow the same code path to exploit this vulnerability once the model is downloaded.

According to Unit 42, more than 700 models on Hugging Face from a variety of developers are provided in NeMo&#39;s file format.

Uni2TS is a PyTorch library created by Salesforce and used in its Morai foundation model for time series analysis along with a set of models published on Hugging Face.

This library works exclusively with .safetensors files, created by Hugging Face as a safe format for storing tensors, as opposed to pickle, which allows for arbitrary code execution during the loading process.

Salesforce models using these libraries have hundreds of thousands of downloads on Hugging Face, and other users have also published several adaptations of these models.

Hugging Face also provides a PyTorchModelHubMixin interface for creating custom model classes that can be integrated with the rest of its framework.

This interface provides a specific mechanism for registering coder functions, and - you guessed it - the uni2TS library uses this mechanism to decode the configuration of a specific argument via a call to hydra.utils.instantiate().

On July 31, Salesforce issued CVE-2026-22584 and deployed a fix.

Early last year, Apple and EPFL VILAB created FlexTok, a Python-based framework that enables AI/ML models to process images.

As with uni2TS, FlexTok only uses safetensors files, it extends PyTorchModelHubMixin, and it can load configuration and meta data from a .safetensors file. After it decodes the metadata, FlexTok passes it to hydra.utils.instantiate(), which triggers the vulnerability.

&quot;As of January 2026, no models on Hugging Face appear to be using the ml-flextok library other than those models published by EPFL VILAB, which have tens of thousands of downloads in total,&quot; Carmony wrote.

Apple and EPFL VILAB fixed these security issues by using YAML to parse their configurations. The maintainers also added an allow list of classes that can call Hydra&#39;s instantiate() function, and updated documentation to say only models from trusted sources should be loaded. ®

            <h2>Anthropic Claude wants to be your helpful colleague, always looking over your shoulder</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-13</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/13/anthropic_previews_claude_cowork_for/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic on Monday announced the research preview of Claude Cowork, a tool for automating office work that comes with the now familiar recitation of machine learning risks.

The company said Cowork was inspired by Claude Code, its tool for generating programming code using natural language prompts and whatever files and tools have been made accessible.

With Claude Code, the output is generally source code or related artifacts like documentation or configuration files. With Cowork, the output may be local files like spreadsheets or interaction with desktop or web applications.

Cowork may find fans among knowledge workers who have to create presentations but take no pride in their work, who need to move data between applications without codified import and export rituals, or who have to conduct extensive reformatting operations in spreadsheets.

It may also find favor as a crutch that allows people with minimal application skills to delegate activities beyond their competency to an AI model with a different set of limitations. Think of all the charts Cowork can produce for those untutored in data science and statistics, or the proposals and position papers it can generate for summarization by other AI models.

But to function, Cowork must have access to files and applications.

That&#39;s where the warning comes in. Anthropic makes it clear that Cowork is a research preview and should be used with caution. Users are advised not to give Cowork access to local files containing sensitive information.

When used in conjunction with the Claude in Chrome extension (which comes with its own safety warning), Cowork should be limited to accessing trusted websites. The same goes for modifying Claude&#39;s default internet settings.

Also, users are advised to &quot;monitor Claude for suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injection.&quot; Yes, if you happen to sic the AI model on a file or website that contains text that could be interpreted as a system instruction rather than data, you could trigger an indirect prompt injection attack. Security researchers have repeatedly shown how relatively easy it is to craft such attacks.

Anthropic goes on to offer reassurance that it implements various layers of protection, like reinforcement learning to convince Claude to refuse malicious instructions and content classifiers that attempt to catch malicious consent before it can be passed to the underlying model.

But the company follows its mollification with a cautionary reprise: &quot;Important: While we&#39;ve enacted these safety measures to reduce risks, the chances of an attack are still non-zero. Always exercise caution when using Cowork.&quot; You&#39;ve been warned.

For those still not convinced to proceed carefully, there&#39;s a disclaimer of liability that insists &quot;You remain responsible for all actions taken by Claude performed on your behalf.&quot;

In case that&#39;s not clear, the company says this includes content published or messages sent, purchases or financial transactions, data accessed or modified, and the terms of service at third-party websites, which, like Amazon, may prohibit automated interaction without permission.

Once you&#39;ve gotten past the disclaimers and the necessary permissions have been granted, and if you happen to meet the access requirements – a Claude Max subscription ($100 or $200 per month) and the Claude macOS desktop app – then you can tell Cowork &quot;Please help organize my desktop.&quot; With any luck, the assistive software will rearrange your messy desktop files more thoroughly than your Mac&#39;s Clean Up Selection command.

That&#39;s not all. &quot;Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder,&quot; Anthropic explains in its blog post. &quot;It can, for example, re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.&quot;

Cowork can be extended to work with third-party apps and sites via Connectors, and with specific file formats like PowerPoint (pptx), Excel (xlsx), Word (docx), and PDF (pdf) via Skills.

The challenge is figuring out what makes sense to automate. Some batch operations on desktop files may be more efficient as CLI commands or shell scripts, which Claude might even compose if asked.

Anthropic has acknowledged that users may have trouble coming up with ways to employ Claude by publishing a list of suggested use cases. These include tasks like &quot;clean up promotional emails,&quot; &quot;organize files in Google Drive,&quot; and &quot;thoughtful gift giving with Claude&quot; .

Anthropic said it expects to make improvements in Cowork based on feedback, and to bring the automation service to Windows. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Everest has been turned into a run-of-the-mill tourist attraction. Space tourism is over now that any celebrity can blast off into orbit. Next up: a hotel on the Moon, now taking reservations for only about six years from now, if you&#39;re willing to make a small deposit.

For the low, low deposit cost of either $250,000 or $1 million, depending on the option selected, you can get in on the inflatable ground floor of GRU&#39;s definitely-going-to-happen inflatable Moon hotel, which it said it wants to have deployed by 2032.

Don&#39;t expect to foot the bill of a private five-day lunar expedition for you and up to three others for the meager deposit cost, though.

&quot;Final pricing has not yet been determined will likely exceed $10 million,&quot; the company states on its reservation website. Yes, we know that sentence is missing either a coordinating conjunction or some critical punctuation. Cut GRU a break - it&#39;s too busy brainstorming Moon hotels to run its website copy through a grammar checker.

For those hoping the company has a more grounded explanation of its Moon hotel fantasy elsewhere on its website, sorry - a &quot;whitepaper&quot; included on the site is just as fantasy-filled and hyperbolic as the rest of its corporate persona.

&quot;GRU Space rejects the notion that we must wait for external validation or government consensus to build the future,&quot; the company says in its whitepaper introduction, echoing a philosophy that&#39;s never been problematic in the history of tourist endeavors in hazardous environments. &quot;Instead, we operate on the principle that conviction must bridge the gap between the status quo and the necessary future.&quot; As anyone who saw 2001: A Space Odyssey knows, lunar hotels are absolutely a necessary part of the future.

GRU intends to first build an inflatable space hotel - the one it wants to have up by 2032 - which will follow a projected 2029 mission that will deploy a miniature version of the hotel along with a miniature drill unit, used to collect a sample of regolith as part of the company’s plan to use in-situ resources.

A second mission in 2031 will deploy a slightly larger test hotel in a lunar pit, where it imagines its eventual full-sized hotel to be inflated due to the protection from micrometeoroids and radiation the lava tube openings provide. The 2031 mission will also include more in-situ resource testing, and the first full-sized hotel will be deployed in 2032.

Once it gets its full-sized, inflatable, four-person hotel built, GRU said it plans to start work on a much fancier 10-person unit built from polymerized lunar regolith that it said will be based on the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts.

Even the first-generation full-sized hotel, however, will require a SpaceX Starship-sized craft to get it to the Moon, the company said in its whitepaper. Chalk that up as yet another catch that could slow the company down.

The company also doesn&#39;t appear to have ownership rights to any of the Moon&#39;s surface on which to build anything at all, yet still hopes it will be part of NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman&#39;s professed Moon base plans, which GRU believes will necessitate commercial partnerships - and dual-use facilities like a Moon hotel.

&quot;If the U.S. must field a base within the decade, there is no time to invent exotic, bespoke government-only infrastructure from scratch,&quot; GRU asserts in its whitepaper. &quot;We believe the only viable path is to lean heavily on commercial hardware and dual-use surface systems with real unit economics.&quot;

The company seems to believe that it&#39;s going to have &quot;revenue sovereignty,&quot; unlike a government agency, thanks to its ability to &quot;tap into high-net-worth private capital&quot; and its marketing of a product people will actually want. That, and &quot;the AI explosion is also creating a new source of ultra wealth,&quot; the company said, making this sound more like a scam to separate gullible tech bros from their bank account balances than a concrete plan for lunar tourism.

&quot;By anchoring our roadmap to a commercial product with intrinsic demand … we end-run competitors who are waiting for NASA to request a shovel,&quot; GRU said.

With an incredibly small customer base, a whitepaper more full of assumptions, assertions, and Despicable Me–themed hyperbole (“It’s time to steal the Moon” - really?) than actual technical details, and a website that suggests the company is more interested in selling Moon hotel merchandise than putting an actual date on the &quot;dawn of lunar tourism,&quot; there&#39;s a lot of skepticism warranted.

That, and there&#39;s no mention of how the hotel is going to be staffed - with that in mind, and no publicly-stated difference between the two reservation packages, perhaps paying the higher price might be worth it?

GRU Space didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory makers just can&#39;t churn out their DRAM fast enough. On the heels of an AI-driven shortage, SK Hynix on Tuesday announced a new 19 trillion Korean won (about $13 billion) advanced packaging and test facility in South Korea that could offer some relief - just not for consumer products like laptops and phones.

The South Korean memory giant unveiled the new site, dubbed P&T7, which will be located at the Cheongju Technopolis Industrial Park in Chungbuk, South Korea. Work on the plant is expected to begin in April with completion targeted for the end of 2027.

The site aims to address surging demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) modules used extensively in datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators. Between 2025 and 2030, SK expects HBM demand to grow by an average of 33 percent a year, fueled in no small part by extreme demand for AI infrastructure.

HBM is manufactured by stacking multiple layers of DRAM - eight and 12 layers are most common - to achieve higher capacity and bandwidth while reducing energy consumption in the process.

The process is incredibly expensive, as a single defect in any of the layers could render the final module worthless. Worse, because of HBM&#39;s prodigious data rates - as high as 2.75 TB/s per module in the latest generations - the chips usually need to be permanently co-packaged alongside the compute logic. This makes the margin incredibly tight. Defective modules could scrap a $50,000 GPU.

Because of this, specialized packaging and test facilities, like SK&#39;s newly announced P&T7 site, are essential to producing HBM in volume.

Development of the P&T7 facility comes as SK Hynix prepares to bring its M15X DRAM plant online. Announced in 2024, the 20 trillion won (about $13.5 billion) DRAM plant was built to address growing HBM demand. It opened its clean room in October and, according to SK, work to deploy fab equipment is progressing smoothly.

While the new packaging site may be welcome news for the likes of AMD or Nvidia - two of the largest consumers of HBM memory - the packaging site will likely do little to address skyrocketing memory prices seen by consumers and businesses over the past few months. While HBM has appeared in consumer products in the past, its extreme cost and complexity usually preclude its use in modern client devices.

DDR5 memory kits that, a year ago, sold for less than $100 are now going for well in excess of $300 as vendors grapple with the ongoing DRAM and NAND crunch.

As we previously reported, DRAM prices are expected to remain high for the next several years, driven in part by strong demand for AI infrastructure. Analysts predict DRAM prices to peak later this year before plateauing in 2027, and rising again in 2028.

While customers pay through the nose, memory vendors are raking in billions of dollars of revenue. Last week, Samsung issued a revised Q4 forecast in which it predicted its operating profits would more than triple, while Micron and SK Hynix&#39;s profits are expected to more than double. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese companies may be unable to import the best US GPUs, but they have found a workaround: renting access to that hardware via cloud services. Now, the US House of Representatives is moving to bring that loophole under the export-control law.

The House of Representatives passed the Remote Access Security Act on Monday by an overwhelming 369-22 bipartisan vote. The bill extends the US Export Control Reform Act to treat certain forms of remote access to export-controlled items - including high-end GPUs and other AI chips - as subject to US export-control law.

&quot;Our export controls are only as strong as the weakest link, and right now, the CCP has a real tool to sidestep these prohibitions,&quot; said bill sponsor Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY).

It&#39;s not like that&#39;s a hypothetical scenario, either: Chinese companies faced with export controls on high-end Nvidia GPUs and other chips have been acquiring access to them through platforms like Amazon Web Services since at least 2023.

According to our prior reporting, Chinese cloud providers such as Alibaba and Tencent may be enabling access to export-controlled GPUs for China-based customers by renting cloud hardware hosted outside the country. Microsoft and AWS, meanwhile, reportedly operate in China via local partners that offer cloud services broadly similar to those available elsewhere.

In short, this is a very real loophole in US export control laws - the chips aren&#39;t going anywhere, after all. This being the internet age, location doesn&#39;t really matter.

&quot;This bill brings our laws into the digital age and makes it clear that cloud compute is subject to U.S. export control law, just like physical chips,&quot; said House Select Committee on China chairman Representative John Moolenaar (R-MI). &quot;Closing these loopholes will strengthen U.S. national security and protect American innovation.&quot;

Passage of the bill through the Senate, and a signature from President Trump, aren&#39;t guarantees, and it&#39;s unknown how the upper chamber and the White House feel about the bill. We reached out to Lawler&#39;s team for more information, but didn&#39;t hear back.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the export of powerful AI chips from the US to China isn&#39;t as locked down as it was when this bill was introduced in April of 2025. Since then, the Trump administration has given Nvidia the go-ahead to sell H200 chips in China, and while not the most advanced Nvidia has to offer, they&#39;re definitely powerful.

Beijing has yet to give its stamp of approval to Nvidia for imports, but it&#39;s believed that they&#39;re likely to do so soon.

That said, China has been pushing its own chip companies to ditch American imports over national security concerns and instead develop its own competitive alternatives, a process that may still take time, though likely not much. ®

            <div id="article-text">AI-pocalypse AI and automation could wipe out 6.1 percent of jobs in the US by 2030 – equating to 10.4 million fewer positions that are held by humans today.

This is according to Forrester veep and principal analyst J.P. Gownder, who states in a blog: &quot;To give you a sense of the magnitude, the US lost 8.7 million jobs during the Great Recession. The numbers aren&#39;t directly comparable, since jobs lost to AI are structural and permanent while those lost during a recession are cyclical and macroeconomic. But no matter how you view it, the numbers are meaningful and worthy of our attention.&quot;

The US population has also grown since the early part of this century, further muddying the waters when talking about absolute numbers.

The &quot;real but modest impact&quot; that Forrester models between 2025 and 2030 suggests that the replacement of large chunks of the workforce remains unlikely, &quot;as labor productivity would need to accelerate significantly for AI to replace human talent at scale.&quot;

The more realistic scenario, it says, is that AI will &quot;augment&quot; one in five roles at the end of the forecast period, indicating employers may need to invest in staff training to prepare them for a new age.

In the tech world, some of the SaaS providers are already making moves to replace parts of the workforce, including Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow.

Still, risks remain. Forrester says there is a danger that &quot;over-automating roles&quot; based on the &quot;hype surrounding&quot; AI can result in &quot;costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.&quot;

Some businesses – Duolingo and Klarna spring to mind – rowed back their efforts to replace meatbags with AI. Forrester last year said it expects 55 percent of corporations to regret the decision to press ahead with these types of projects and quietly rehire people.

Forrester today cites a million US layoffs in 2025 with some attributed to AI. Gownder recalls discussions with clients that want advice on laying off 20 percent of their staff in the lurch toward AI.

&quot;When we ask if they have a mature, vetted AI app ready to fill in those jobs, nine out of ten times, the answer is no – and they haven&#39;t even started. So most of the layoffs are financially driven and AI is just the scapegoat, at least today.&quot;

So what has changed since Forrester&#39;s previous AI jobs forecast in 2023? Agentic AI has hit the market, and organizations are using it to create applications Forrester claims are more accurate – though not according to everyone – and solve specific problems.

Generative AI projects, both successes and failures, are also teaching the market how to get better results, Gownder says.

&quot;Where our earlier forecast saw just 29 percent of US jobs lost to automation coming from GenAI, that number is now 50 percent, which accounts for agentic AI solutions that leverage GenAI as well.&quot;

As for the 20 percent of positions that will be influenced by AI, this &quot;represents a nearly fourfold increase compared with our 2023 forecast.&quot;

All of which means that while jobs will be going, &quot;we&#39;re not heading for an imminent AI job apocalypse.&quot; AI might take over some workflows and tasks, but in the next five years, Forrester thinks that work will be mostly undertaken by humans. ®

Including cases that protect your Switch 2 as you play, and others that can keep it scratch-free during transit.

You might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Sure, it can take away from the slick design. But using a case relieves me of the worry that the console will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since it launched in June, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.

It didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.

We use each Switch 2 case as it was designed to be used. We follow the instructions to get the best fit and protection, noting along the way when a feature works better than expected, or worse. We don’t perform drop tests (I’m using my personal, and thus treasured, Switch 2), but we try our best to find weak points in each case.

Installing a case should be easy, not cumbersome. Given the Switch 2’s hybrid design, a multi-step process is expected, but it should be easy to install the case every time with little effort.

Since many gadget cases are made before said technology is publicly available, I make sure the cases that I test actually fit the Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference isn’t good enough for me or you.

Some protective cases come with compromises, like preventing you from detaching the Switch 2’s Joy-Con 2 controllers. Others block the kickstand, and/or prevent the console from fitting into its dock for playing on a TV. Compromises are fine as long as you know what they are beforehand. I think most people want a case that doesn’t block the Switch 2’s unique features, so I’ve focused mostly on picks that retain them, except where noted otherwise.

I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.

As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.

Very secure fitMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)Clever dock adapter

Chunky dock adapterNot the most affordable caseFront protection only comes in the $80 tier

The least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off.

Unfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as an extender for it’s USB-C jack. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.

The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.

When this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their magnet-releasing buttons. In other words, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.

The Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.

I’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units).

Lastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.

Another runner-up is the ModCase from Jsaux. The foundation of the accessory pack is the plastic and silicone case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s inside), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a small section on the rear of the case that juts out, and that’s where each of its “mods” can be attached.

The basic $29.99 kit includes just a couple of basics: a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those plus several other extras. You get a face plate for the console to protect its screen while not in use, as well as an accessory with a magnet to let you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, for use when the ModCase is installed. It looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution included with the Killswitch. But, hey, it all works as intended performance-wise.

Tomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.

The FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.

WaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories -- one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.

High-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.

Power A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried.

At just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).

This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.

For $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.

Belkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.

The Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.

If you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.

The $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.

Belkin is sending over its new Charging Case Pro for testing. The company debuted this new model at CES 2026, and it features some thoughtful upgrades compared to the $70 charging case that includes a battery. Namely, you don’t have to connect the Switch 2 and the battery together via a cable. Just nestle the Switch 2 into the kickstand-meets-cradle. The case also features a screen that shows battery percentage remaining, and an external USB-C port for easily recharging the case.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

﻿Nia DaCosta’s 28 Years Later sequel turns the franchise on its head with a story about spirituality in the end times.

Because there was such a long gap between the releases of 28 Weeks Later and 28 Years Later, it was surprising to hear that writer-director duo Alex Garland and Danny Boyle already had plans for their latest collaboration to be the first chapter of a new horror trilogy. Sony seemed keen on fast-tracking the pair’s idea, as 28 Years Later and its sequel began shooting back to back. But it also felt like the studio wanted to bring a different kind of energy into the franchise when it tapped Nia DaCosta to direct the new film.

That energy and its distinctness from Boyle’s directorial voice is palpable in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — a film that understands how much more potent horror is when it’s laced with goofy humor. Though there’s no shortage of gore and stomach-turning violence, leaning into comedy is one of the movie’s more clever ways of illustrating what its characters are fighting for. Each of The Bone Temple’s jokes is a reminder of how, in a world full of flesh-eating ghouls, human connection and community are the kinds of things people are willing to die for.

The Bone Temple picks up soon after 28 Years Later to find teenager Spike (Alfie Williams) trying to make sense of his life as a newly inducted member of Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal’s (Jack O’Connell) roving cult of platinum blonde wig-wearing droogs who all go by “Jimmy.” Spike can handle himself alright against a couple of the infected lurking in the English wilderness, but his skills with a bow and arrow are nothing compared to the Jimmys’ ultraviolent approach to dealing with anything that crosses their path.

Murdering people — infected or not — at Jimmy Crystal’s command has become second nature for Jimmy Ink (Erin Kellyman), Jimmima (Emma Laird), and the rest of their demented crew. Spike finds it hard to buy Jimmy Crystal’s claims of being spoken to and directed by a higher, unseen power, but he knows that he has no choice but to join the gang and dress up like a sexual predator when they ask him to join their ranks.

It’s through the Jimmys as a unit that 28 Years Later starts exploring the ways that faith can be weaponized to harm the very same people that it provides psychological comfort to. The Jimmys are a twisted family bound by a genuine fondness for one another and an understanding that they’re safer as a group. But the movie presents their willingness to follow Jimmy Crystal as being born out of fear and a more general gullibility caused by society’s collapse.

One of the most striking things about O’Connell’s performance is how — for all of Jimmy Crystal’s psychopathy and moments of delusion — he makes the character come across as a scared boy trapped inside an unhinged man’s body. The movie says as much through Jimmy’s frequent mentions of the Teletubbies and the way he insists that his father, Satan, is whispering commands into his ear. Jimmy’s delusional rantings are convincing to his relatively young followers because they have grown up in a world where level-minded authority figures who can teach them fact from fiction are few and far between. But the cult leader’s bluster is less effective when it’s aimed at older people with more life experience and memories of the pre-plague world, like Dr. Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes).

It’s through Kelson that The Bone Temple starts to ask and answer a number of fascinating questions about those infected with the plague virus, like Samson (Chi Lewis-Parry), the hulking, spine-ripping Alpha introduced in 28 Years Later. The new movie spends much more time with these returning characters to give us a better understanding of what their lives have been like and how they’ve both been changed by meeting one another. Fiennes and Lewis-Parry are tremendous together as The Bone Temple moves Kelson and Samson closer in ways that are surprising, alarming, and unexpectedly funny. But as much levity as the pair bring to this story, The Bone Temple also uses them to remind you what humanity has lost in the 28 years since the Rage contagion got loose.

Whereas 28 Years Later felt very much like a film that was in conversation with zombie narratives inspired by 28 Days Later, The Bone Temple draws much of its inspiration from older pieces of the undead canon. DaCosta punctuates scenes of Samson’s berserker hunt for flesh with unsettling moments of stillness and tight, nauseating shots of him cracking skulls open to scarf down his victims’ brains. In the context of the movie, Samson is a new kind of infected — one with more intelligence and the ability to socialize with others like him. But as a screen presence, the character comes across a lot like a tribute to the shambling corpses that made George Romero a cinematic icon.

Though DaCosta inherited much of this story from Boyle and Garland’s last collaboration, she makes it her own by leaning into a less frenetic style of visual storytelling. Some of the movie’s biggest scares work because of how slowly they’re revealed. But just when it seems like the movie is at its most disturbing, DaCosta defuses some of that tension with a handful of perfectly placed needle drops.

It was hard to get a sense of how 28 Years Later might grow into a compelling trilogy. But The Bone Temple makes it clear that Boyle and Garland have been cooking with heat from the very beginning of this new chapter of the larger franchise. DaCosta masterfully sets up a number of promising developments for the trilogy’s conclusion, which will see Boyle return to wrap things up. And if the next film manages to inject a similar level of life into the undead genre, it will all have been worth the wait.

28 Days Later: The Bone Temple also stars Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Maura Bird, Ghazi Al Ruffai, Sam Locke, and Cillian Murphy. The film hits theaters on January 16th.

It comes amid the global uproar over X’s mass AI undressing of users on its platform.

The Senate passed a bill that could give people who’ve found their likeness deepfaked into sexually-explicit images without their consent a new way to fight back.

The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act (DEFIANCE Act), would let victims sue the individuals who created the images for civil damages. The bill passed with unanimous consent — meaning there was no roll-call vote, and no Senator objected to its passage on the floor Tuesday. It’s meant to build on the work of the Take It Down Act, a law that criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) and requires social media platforms to promptly remove them.

The passage comes as policymakers around the world have threatened action against X for enabling users to create nonconsensual and sexually suggestive AI images with its Grok chatbot. X owner Elon Musk has shrugged off blame onto the individuals prompting Grok, writing, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” But even after pushback, X continued to let users prompt Grok to virtually strip people down.

Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a lead sponsor of the bill, referenced Grok’s nonconsensual undressing in remarks on the Senate floor. “Even after these terrible deepfake, harming images are pointed out to Grok and to X, formerly Twitter, they do not respond. They don’t take the images off of the internet. They don’t come to the rescue of people who are victims,” Durbin said. Though the Take It Down Act, whose takedown provision goes into full force later this year, could have implications for X, the DEFIANCE Act would impact individuals, like those Grok users creating deepfaked nonconsensual intimate imagery.

Governments around the world are creating new protections against AI-generated nonconsensual images, spurred in part by the recent Grok controversy. The UK, for example, recently pushed up a law that criminalizes the creation of nonconsensual intimate deepfakes.

The DEFIANCE Act similarly passed the Senate in 2024 following a different nonconsensual deepfake scandal on X. Early that year, sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift circulated on the platform. Durbin along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the bill to expand on a provision in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, which gave people whose non-AI generated intimate images were shared without consent a right to sue. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has found her own image digitally altered in nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, sponsored the bill in the House. The bill stalled in the House without a vote during the last Congress, requiring the Senate to take it up again this year. Now the ball is again in the House leadership’s court; if they decide to bring the bill to the floor, it will have to pass in order to reach the president’s desk.

Haven’t you heard? Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.

But even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can still find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that offers full water and dust resistance, there are flip phones that offer more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. There are even a few that offer fun styles. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware. And stay tuned — if CES 2026 was anything to go by, there may be some even more interesting phones in our future.

A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates are a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras perform well in good lighting, from flagship models to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to improve low-light performance is a must in this category.

The very best devices carry robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.

In addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to recommending a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price, or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.

Zoom capabilities are weak compared to the ProGets hot during heavy gaming sessionsApple Intelligence is still somewhere between useless and MIA

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

This year’s standard iPhone offers a handful of major upgrades over its predecessor, including a larger 6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz panel and an always-on display. These two features make the everyday experience meaningfully better, but they’re not the only ones: you also get faster performance, better battery life, and twice the amount of base storage at 256GB. It also has the same starting price of $799, which is a shockingly great deal.

On the camera front, the iPhone 17’s new 48-megapixel ultrawide matches the Pro’s resolution, delivering sharper, more vibrant shots, while the main camera remains reliably good in most conditions. It also features the Pro’s 18-megapixel selfie camera, which lets you take horizontal shots without rotating the device. If you care about zoom or portraits, the iPhone 17’s lack of a telephoto camera is the clearest reason to go Pro. For most people, though, the device’s 2x “optical quality” zoom will be fine for everyday snaps, making it a great upgrade.

Qi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice addition

Main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68

The Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.

But, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.

Overall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera tradeoffs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.

Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68

Samsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it.

This year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.

Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen

Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance: IP68

Every year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. In 2024, it was the Pixel 8A, and last year, it was the even better Pixel 9A. For $500 (and very often, less), the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other inexpensive devices.

The Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.

What’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe (Qi2) / Weather-resistance: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro is the model to get if you want Apple’s most capable camera system and the longest battery life you can get in an iPhone. All three rear sensors use 48-megapixel lenses — including the telephoto with 4x zoom — and support creator-focused tools like ProRes RAW. Apple’s switch to an aluminum body with a vapor chamber also helps keep temperatures low during intensive tasks, including high-res video recording, while the Ceramic Shield 2 front improves durability. And it’s all wrapped in a fresh, rounded design.

As part of that redesign, Apple carved out the frame to fit a larger battery, which lasts through a typical day of mixed use while browsing social media, gaming, etc. The 17 Pro supports 40W wired charging and slightly faster MagSafe charging, allowing you to take it from zero to 50 percent in as little as 20 minutes. It also supports USB 3 for lightning-fast transfer speeds, so you can quickly copy over all your vacation photos and videos to your laptop.

Since the standard iPhone 17 has the same 120Hz refresh rate and an always‑on display, it’s easier to skip the Pro this year. That being said, if you want longer battery life and the most flexible camera system in the lineup, the 17 Pro is the way to go. Plus, it comes in a bold orange shade that’s unlike anything else in Apple’s lineup.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48

Samsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.

The Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.

Under the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the Z Flip 6, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.

Unfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device might hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Concerns over long-term durability have kept us from recommending foldables to anyone but the most diehard gadget nerd. Then Google said “hold my USB-C cable” and bestowed an IP68 rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, making it the first foldable to provide full water and dust resistance. That means the device can survive a tumble on the beach without the hinge and inner screen failing. What’s more, the device features Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging. And with a new Tensor G5 chip, it offers smooth performance, whether you’re playing intensive games like Diablo Immortal or multitasking on the larger inner display.

As much as we love the 10 Pro Fold’s improved durability, its cameras can’t quite keep up with those of other 10 Pro models. The device is also heavy and rather chunky; it’s over 40 grams heavier than Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and nearly 2 millimeters thicker when folded shut. There’s a plus side to the thicker frame, though: it leaves more room for the phone’s larger battery, which can last a full day with minimal use of the inner display. If you find yourself spending most of your time using the larger display, you may need to find the nearest outlet by the end of the day.

Update, January 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed mention of the OnePlus 13R, and added info about the Samsung Z TriFold and the OnePlus 15R. Brandon Russell and Barbara Krasnoff also contributed to this post.

﻿Chief product officer Mike Krieger will change roles and join the “Labs” team.

Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder who joined Anthropic two years ago as its chief product officer, is moving to a new focus at the AI startup: co-leading its internal incubator, dubbed the “Labs” team.

The Anthropic Labs team started in mid-2024 with just two members; now, the company has decided to expand it, with a focus on building “experimental products.” Krieger’s new title will be simply a member of technical staff reporting to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei, and he’ll co-lead the Labs team with Ben Mann, who has been the company’s product engineering lead. Ami Vora, the company’s current “head of product,” will take over Krieger’s duties and work closely with the company’s chief technology officer, Rahul Patil, to scale products, the company said.

The company hopes to double the number of Labs team members in the next six months.

In a statement to The Verge, Krieger said, “We’ve reached a watershed moment in AI—model capabilities are advancing so fast that the window to shape how they’re used is now. That’s why I’m getting back into builder mode, moving from my role as CPO and joining our Labs team: I want to be hands-on at the frontier, building products that channel AI toward solving the world’s hardest problems. I’m excited to pass the baton to Ami as she leads the team in scaling Claude.”

Anthropic’s C-suite shake-up comes at a time when competition among AI startups and tech giants has never been more stiff. Tech giants like Apple and Google are trying to shore up defenses against high-flying startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, while companies of all sizes are attempting to differentiate themselves by rebranding their longtime goal of “artificial general intelligence” (AGI). They’re also trying to set themselves apart in the AI agent game by constantly one-upping each other with new features designed to corner the market on consumers. As AI companies’ fundraising rounds balloon significantly — i.e., Anthropic is reportedly planning to raise $10 billion on a $350 billion valuation — investors are eager to see delivery on their promises.

Anthropic president Daniela Amodei said in a statement to The Verge that the “speed of advancement in AI demands a different approach to how we build, how we organize, and where we focus. Labs gives us room to break the mold and explore.”

Get some peace and quiet with any of our top picks for noise-canceling headphones. Sony’s still the best overall, but there are reasons to go elsewhere, too.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Whether you’re wearing them for the morning commute, while traveling, or if you’re simply trying to find some peace and quiet while working at home, noise-canceling headphones are a more essential piece of kit nowadays than ever before. And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from; it’s hard to make a bad choice.

There are longtime heavyweights like Bose and Sony to pick from. Apple has quickly carved into the market with the luxurious AirPods Max. And if you’ve got an ear that demands the best audio quality, headphones from Bowers & Wilkins and Sennheiser might appeal to you more than the mainstream contenders.

Not everyone loves the feel of earbuds, and there are scenarios where over-ear and on-ear headphones are just simpler or make more sense than wireless buds — particularly if lengthy battery life matters to you.

No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed.

We put our top picks for noise-canceling headphones through many hours of testing. Since their ability to tamp down the loudness of your surroundings is critical, we use them in a variety of environments — including busy city streets, the office, coffee shops, and public transit — and for more quiet, focused listening at home.We sample their transparency mode to see how clearly the outside world comes through and if it’s easy to carry on conversations while wearing the headphones. We have friends and family try them on and provide feedback on the fit and comfort. And, of course, we have our favorite albums and playlists on repeat to assess how each pair sounds and how much listening time you can expect from a single charge.

If headphones are causing a sore spot at the top of your noggin, what good are they no matter how good they sound or cancel noise? Traditionally, the lighter they are, the more comfortable the headphones will prove over extended listening sessions. But manufacturers can also help improve comfort by being thoughtful in the materials they choose for ear cups and the headband that wraps over your cranium. Clamping force is another important factor; some headphones will squeeze your head more firmly than others; this can be great if you want a pair to stay put for exercise, but not ideal if you’re just trying to relax and tune out the world.

Practically any of our picks will do an excellent job at providing distraction-free listening when on a flight, at the office, or if you’re traversing city streets. Noise-canceling headphones work by using built-in microphones to listen to the sounds in your environment, and they invert those soundwaves to eliminate the cacophony of everyday life.

Having powerful noise-canceling used to mean compromising on sound quality, but that’s simply not the case anymore. Most of today’s flagship ANC headphones provide dynamic, rich, and immersive sound. They support a variety of Bluetooth audio codecs, and some (like Sony’s LDAC and aptX HD) can deliver higher bitrates than the status quo AAC and SBC codecs. But don’t get bogged down in those details; headphones that are tuned well with the right components can make your music sound fantastic regardless of codecs.

One benefit of buying headphones instead of earbuds is that they can last much longer on a single charge. Whereas you’ll need to plop most earbuds back into their case after five hours or so, wireless headphones can keep the music going for around 20 hours. And some recent models can even exceed that, reaching 60 hours.

We all try to do our best at multitasking, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is essential for headphones to meet the same challenge. Multipoint allows your noise-canceling headphones to pair with two devices at the same time. This makes it easy to take a call on your phone and get right back to the music you were playing on your laptop without fussing with Bluetooth settings menus.

Headphones are increasingly gaining features that are exclusive to individual manufacturer ecosystems. For example, the AirPods Max are capable of head-tracking spatial audio and other tricks like audio sharing — but only if you’re listening to them with one of the company’s other products, like an iPhone, Mac, or iPad.

Even better active noise cancellationMore balanced, tighter soundMuch-improved voice call quality

Design is very plasticky for $400No major new features over 1000XM4Bulky, awkward carrying case

Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (charging), 3.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Sony’s WH-1000XM5 have a completely different design from their predecessors. The changes result in greater comfort when you wear them on your head for extended periods of time — like on a flight or at the office.

Noise cancellation has been further improved from the already-stellar performance of the WH-1000XM4, putting Sony at the front of the pack compared to all major competitors. Sound quality is more detailed and balanced than the older XM4; the low end is still punchy but tighter and less boomy than before. The XM5 offer excellent voice call performance, and they can connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in on what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet.

Sony’s headphones also include unique features like “speak to chat,” which automatically pauses your music and pipes in ambient audio whenever you start talking. Or you can hold one hand over the right ear cup to activate quick attention mode, which is convenient when grabbing a coffee or listening to airport announcements. And like other high-end headphones, the XM5 can detect when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause.

Last year, Sony introduced the WH-1000XM6, and while they offer incremental improvements over the XM5 in terms of sound and ANC performance, they’re also more expensive at $449.99. The XM5, meanwhile, can regularly be found for $300 or less. When you weigh price versus performance, the XM5 represent a better value overall, which is why they remain at the top of our list.

Exemplary comfortTop-tier noise cancellationImproved transparency mode clarityBetter voice call quality than NCH700

Immersive Audio is sometimes enjoyable but often badImmersive Audio drains battery fasterNo USB-C audio supportCase has annoying indentations

Battery life: 24 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are basically a blend of the company’s prior Noise Canceling Headphones 700 and QuietComfort 45 that borrow the best traits from both — while throwing in a new “immersive audio” listening mode. Like past Bose cans, they’re very light and comfortable on your head, even when worn for long stretches of time. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded, making them easier to travel with.

Their 24-hour battery life is more than adequate, and Bose has added support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec for improved audio fidelity on Android devices. The immersive audio feature works well on some songs, but less so on others. It’s worth experimenting with, but even if you leave it off entirely, you’re left with best-in-class noise cancellation, pleasing sound, and a helpful “aware” transparency mode.

It’s worth noting that, in September, Bose launched the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) for $449. The newer headphones build on the original with support for lossless audio over USB-C, a slight uptick in battery life, and an improved transparency mode that’s more natural and better at boosting ANC when you encounter sudden noises. They offer a handful of other iterative improvements, but as is the case with Sony’s newer WH-1000XM6, their higher price tag keeps us from recommending them over the original model.

High-luxury designTerrific, balanced sound qualityVery effective noise cancellationDependable and foolproof controlsSpatial audio for immersive entertainment

Heavier than many competitorsNo 3.5mm jackWired listening requires $35 cableCase is an abominationLacks latest AirPods Pro features

Battery life: 20 hours / Multipoint: No / Audio codecs: AAC, SBC / Connectors: Lightning (audio and charging)

There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls, rather than relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes.

The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver audio quality that’s up there with the best high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage and fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. The newer USB-C model also supports lossless audio and ultra low latency thanks to a firmware update, which, technically, isn’t something you’ll find on the last-gen Lightning model.

Apple’s noise cancellation is on par with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow their daunting price.

But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.

Stylish, standout designExcellent sound qualitySupports wired USB-C audio

No regular headphone inputDoesn’t include LDAC supportYour ears might get sweaty

Battery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (audio and charging)

If sound quality is priority number one, then Bowers & Wilkins has you covered with the PX7 S2e headphones. They exhibit superb, detailed sound quality that some people prefer to the AirPods Max. The Bowers & Wilkins cans are true to the company’s legacy and style, with a fine-crafted design that exudes quality. And the newer “e” variant has a revamped digital signal processing that can bring out the best audio quality from streaming music.

We prefer their physical buttons over the tap/swipe ear cup gestures of Sony’s WH-1000XM5. With 30 hours of battery life, they’re more than competitive with mainstream, less expensive picks. And the sound profile is delightfully warm and will bring out the most from your favorite music. The main downside of the PX7 S2e is that there’s no traditional 3.5mm or 2.5mm output for a headphone cable. You can still listen wired over USB-C, however.

Much-improved comfortBetter noise cancellation than beforeMarathon 60-hour battery life

Terribly generic designNo more physical button controlsHeadphones can power on unexpectedly

Battery life: 60 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, aptX, AAC, SBC / Connectors: USB-C (audio and charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio)

Sixty hours. They can last for up to 60 hours on a single charge. That’s really all you need to know about the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones if you’re looking for an endurance champ. But they also sound terrific and prove extremely comfortable over long listening periods. This combination doesn’t come cheap, but you can routinely find them for under $300, or, in the case of Black Friday, under $200.

Sennheiser’s Momentum 4 Wireless headphones edge out Bowers & Wilkins on comfort thanks to their lighter design, and the noise cancellation is slightly better. Next to the Sonys and Bose’s QC Ultra Headphones, it doesn’t get much cozier. These are headphones you can wear for multiple hours without any fatigue or pressure on your ears.

Sennheiser’s sound signature is a bit more expressive with more emphasis on bass than the B&W, but the upper treble range still comes through crystal clear. Our only real nitpick with the Sennheisers is that they tend to occasionally power on inside the case and automatically connect for no apparent reason.

Both the B&W and Sennheiser headphones support multipoint connectivity and a range of Bluetooth codecs, including SBC, AAC, aptX, and aptX Adaptive.

Update, January 13th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and several new related links. We also added a mention of the latest QC Ultra Headphones.

Sodium-ion batteries are making their way into cars—and the grid

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered our phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. But lithium’s limited supply and volatile price have led the industry to seek more resilient alternatives. Enter: sodium-ion batteries.

They work much like lithium-ion ones: they store and release energy by shuttling ions between two electrodes. But unlike lithium, a somewhat rare element that is currently mined in only a handful of countries, sodium is cheap and found everywhere. Read why it’s poised to become more important to our energy future.

Sodium-ion batteries are one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Take a look at what else made the list.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese companies showcased everything from AI gadgets to household appliances to robots, and the overall mood among them was upbeat. Here’s why.This story was first featured in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter giving you the inside story of what’s going on in AI. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Monday.

At some point this month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial.

The volunteers—who are covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

However, some experts warn the trial is too small, and likely won’t reveal anything useful. Read the full story.

While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains.

By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. And their output encapsulates how difficult it’s becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. Read the full story.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Our AI writers make their big bets for the coming year—here are five hot trends to watch.

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.
