            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla published its financial results for 2025 this afternoon. If 2024 was a bad year for the electric automaker, 2025 was far worse: For the first time in Tesla’s history, revenues fell year over year.

Earlier this month, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.

Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.

Although total revenue for the quarter fell by 3 percent, Tesla’s operating profits grew by 20 percent. But declining income from operations, which also got much more expensive, saw Tesla’s net profit plummet 61 percent, to $840 million. Without the $542 million from regulatory credits, things would have looked even bleaker.

Selling 1,636,129 cars in 2025 generated $69.5 billion in revenue, 10 percent less than Tesla’s 2024 revenue. But storage and energy increased 27 percent year over year to $12.7 billion, and services grew by 19 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. Together, these two divisions now contribute meaningful amounts to the business, unlike just a few short years ago.

As a result, total revenues for 2025 only fell by 3 percent. But Tesla saw a 38 percent drop in income from operations, and its expenses went up by 23 percent. As a result, the company’s once-envied profit margin was just 4.9 percent for the year, down from 7.2 percent last year. (In 2022, Tesla had a 23.8 percent profit margin.)

Consequently, its $3.8 billion net profit for the year was a reduction of 46 percent compared to 2024. Tesla blames falling sales and lower regulatory credits for its decreased revenue and falling profits, despite those regulatory credits contributing $2 billion—52 percent of its annual net profit.

There were few specifics in the outlook section of Tesla’s presentation to its investors. It claims that this year will see volume production of its two-seat Cybercab robotaxi, the long-delayed Tesla Semi class 8 truck, and its next Megabuck energy storage system. Tesla also says it expects its investment in AI to start contributing to its annual profit, although elsewhere in the presentation, we learned that the company recently agreed to invest $2 billion into xAI, the deepfake- and CSAM-generating company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.

Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested last year by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.

“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”

RAMP was founded in 2012 and rebranded in 2021, according to security firm Rapid 7. The platform served Russian, Chinese, and English speakers and counted more than 14,000 registered users, who underwent strict vetting before being accepted or paid a $500 fee for anonymous participation. The forum provided discussion groups, cyberattack tutorials, and a marketplace for malware and services. Its chief administrator said in 2024 the site earned $250,000 annually.

In a message posted to a rebranded XSS site, a purported RAMP member announced the shutdown.

I regret to inform you that the police authorities have taken control of the Ramp forum. This event has destroyed years of my work building the freest forum in the world, and while I hoped this day would never come, I always knew in my heart it was possible. It’s a risk we all take.

Although I no longer manage Ramp and will not be creating a new forum from scratch, I will continue to purchase access. My main business remains unchanged…

Good luck to everyone, take care of yourselves and your loved ones,

There’s no word of arrests or detentions of any RAMP operators or users. The seizure notice invited people to submit tips through the FBI’s IC3 portal. US authorities have yet to release a statement mentioning the takedown.

DNS records show that servers resolving the RAMP domain now belong to the FBI. It’s not known if the agents now have access to user databases and other sensitive site information. If so, site users who weren’t careful may be tracked down by law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Seven things to know about how Apple's Creator Studio subscriptions work</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/seven-things-to-know-about-how-apples-creator-studio-subscriptions-work/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s new Creator Studio subscription bundle officially launches today, offering access to a wide range of updated professional apps for an all-or-nothing price of $12.99 a month or $129 a year. Teachers and students can get the same apps for $2.99 a month, or $29.99 a year.

The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners:

When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift exclusively to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren’t always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are continuously being ratcheted upward.

Apple’s subscription shift looks a little less like Adobe’s approach to Photoshop and a little more like Microsoft’s approach to Office: many of these apps, particularly the Mac versions, will remain available for free or as standalone one-time purchases from the App Store.

In lieu of running through each of these apps’ new features one by one, we’ve gathered answers to some questions about how the new subscriptions will work and how they’ll compare to the standalone versions of the apps.

Apple still offers Mac App Store versions of the following apps as one-time purchases:

If you’ve already bought those apps from the Mac App Store at any point in the past, you’ll still have access to them, and they’ll be updated to the current versions at no charge.

While Mac users are generally pretty well taken care of here, current iPad users of Final Cut Pro or Logic are getting the short end of the stick. When those apps were initially introduced on the iPad, they cost $4.99 per app per month, or $49 per year per app. Those standalone subscriptions appear to have been axed with the introduction of the Creator Studio bundle.

The downside of Apple’s all-or-nothing pricing is that the bundle is only a great value if you actually intend to use multiple apps on multiple platforms regularly. People who are already splitting their time between the Mac and the iPad and using more than one of these apps will get a lot of value for their money; anyone who just wants to run Final Cut Pro on their iPad is looking at a big price hike.

The short answer is “yes, the standalone versions of these apps will generally be updated in lockstep with the Creator Studio versions.” But Apple is taking slightly different approaches depending on the app.

All of the Apple Creator Studio apps are brand-new versions with new version numbers: Final Cut Pro jumps from version 11 to version 12, for example, and Keynote, Pages, and Numbers (apps I still think of collectively as “iWork” despite that name being well over a decade out of date) are being bumped from version 14 to version 15. Apple’s Creator Studio support document lists all of the new version numbers.

For the paid apps, these new versions will be downloaded and installed just as previous Mac App Store updates have been. The standalone Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Compressor, Motion, and MainStage apps have already been updated to the new version numbers, and installing any of them will pull down the latest version.

But the standalone version of Pixelmator Pro is still listed as the old version, 3.7.1, while the new version 4.0 requires a Creator Studio subscription. It’s not clear whether that’s going to change.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, the iOS and iPadOS versions of the new apps will be seamlessly installed in place of the old apps. But it’s being handled slightly differently on the Mac for some reason. All three apps now have two versions listed in the app store: the old ones, set at version 14.5, and the new ones, set at 15.1. Installing the 14.5 update, which was released today, adds a prompt when you launch the old apps, informing you that they’re out of date and that you should install the new ones instead.

Users can have both the standalone and Creator Studio versions of all apps installed on their devices at the same time. You’ll be able to tell both versions apart using their icons—the standalone apps keep the same icons they had before, and the Creator Studio versions get the occasionally controversial high-contrast Liquid Glass-ified redesigns.

Incidentally, you can also tell the versions of the apps apart by their App Store listings. The standalone ones are just referred to by their names (i.e., “Final Cut Pro,” “Logic Pro”) while the new ones have more modern obnoxious search-optimized titles (“Final Cut Pro: Create Video,” “Logic Pro: Make Music,” “Keynote: Design Presentations”).

The brightest dividing line between the standalone and Creator Studio apps is for the free ones, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. All three look the same whether you have an active subscription or not, but the free versions will prompt you to upgrade to Creator Studio any time you attempt to use “premium” features, which as of this writing includes document templates and generative AI features.

A Creator Studio subscription is also required to access the “Content Hub,” a library of stock images available only in the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (at least for now; they should also be available in Freeform “later this year”). Apple may expand the Content Hub with video and audio content suitable for Final Cut Pro or Logic at some point in the future, but it’s not something the company is offering right now.

At least as of this writing, the paid standalone Mac apps don’t appear to be missing any major features relative to the Creator Studio versions. There’s no way to know whether this will change except to wait and see.

An Apple Creator Studio subscription can be shared among up to six Apple accounts using Family Sharing, potentially defraying the cost of the subscription further. This only applies to the standard version of the subscription; education subscriptions can’t be shared.

Apple accounts attached to an active subscription can install the apps on up to 10 devices simultaneously. This is a relatively generous allotment compared to Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which just allows installation on two devices at once and only allows the apps to be used on a single system at a time.

Apple outlines detailed system requirements for each app on its support page here. For most of the Mac apps, all you need is a Mac running macOS 15.6 Sequoia or later; the only Mac app that requires macOS 26 Tahoe is Pixelmator Pro. Most of the apps will also run on either Intel or Apple Silicon Macs, though MainStage is Apple Silicon-exclusive, and “some features” in Compressor may also require Apple Silicon.

The requirements for the iPad apps are a little more restrictive; you generally need to be running either iPadOS 18.6 or iPadOS 26, and both Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro either want an Apple M1, an Apple A16, or an Apple A17 Pro (in other words, it will work on every iPad Apple currently sells, but older iPad hardware is more hit or miss).

Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the generative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says that, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50 presentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate presenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be possible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries, server availability, and network availability.”

These AI features are all based on OpenAI technology, but don’t require users to have their own OpenAI or ChatGPT account (the flip side is that if you already pay for ChatGPT, that won’t benefit you here). Apple also says that the content you use to generate images, presentations, or notes “will never be used to train intelligence models.”

There are three major creative apps that Apple offers that haven’t been bundled into Creator Studio, and also haven’t gotten a major new update: iMovie, GarageBand, and Photomator.

There are extenuating circumstances that explain why these three apps haven’t been given a Creator Studio-style overhaul. The iMovie and GarageBand apps have always sort of been positioned as “lite” free-to-use versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, respectively, while Photomator is a recently acquired app that overlaps somewhat with the built-in Photos app.

Apple has nothing to share about the future of any of the three apps. Both iMovie and Photomator received minor updates today, presumably related to maintaining compatibility with the Creator Studio apps, and GarageBand was last updated a month ago. Expect them to stick around in their current forms for at least a while.</div>

            <h2>Stranded boys struggle to survive in Lord of the Flies trailer</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/bbcs-lord-of-the-flies-miniseries-gets-a-trailer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">BBC One has adapted William Golding’s classic 1954 novel Lord of the Flies into a new miniseries and just dropped the first trailer. The book has been adapted for film three times since its publication and also inspired the Emmy-nominated TV series Yellowjackets (renewed for its fourth and final season this year). This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel.

Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children’s novel called The Coral Island, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a “savage” people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who “behave the way children really would behave.”

In Lord of the Flies, a British airplane evacuating a group of young boys from war-torn England crashes on an isolated, uninhabited island. A boy named Ralph finds a conch shell and uses it as a horn, commanding enough respect for the boys to look to him as their chief. Initially, Ralph’s leadership helps the stranded boys establish sufficient order to survive and keep a signal fire going, thanks to the lenses in Piggy’s glasses. But that tenuous order soon begins to fray, with the community splitting into two tribes, the second led by the wilder Jack. Violence inevitably breaks out, resulting in the deaths of two of the boys. Eventually, the survivors are rescued by a British naval ship, and the boys are forced to confront the “end of innocence.”

Lord of the Flies has remained relevant ever since its publication as a cautionary, if cynical, tale about how social hierarchies can break down into tribal violence, although it should be noted that a real 1965 incident with stranded Tongan boys exemplified the exact opposite effect. Lord of the Flies is a novel, not a sociological treatise. But its broad cultural influence is undeniable. Stephen King even named his fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine, after Jack’s mountain camp in Lord of the Flies.

Winston Sawyers stars as Ralph in the BBC miniseries, with Lox Pratt playing Jack and David McKenna playing Piggy. The cast also includes Ike Talbot as Simon; Thomas Connor as Roger; Noah Flemyng as Sam; Cassius Flemyng as Eric; Cornelius Brandreth as Maurice; Tom Page-Turner as Bill;’ Rafael de Belligny as Robert; Freddie Lee-Gray as Percival; Beau Thompson as Philip; Fred Jones as Johnny;  and Lake Coleman as Boy with Birthmark. In addition, more than 20 other young boys were cast (many with no acting experience) to play the camp’s “big ‘uns” and “little ‘uns.”

Lord of the Flies debuts in the UK on BBC One on February 8, 2026.</div>

            <h2>SpaceX sends list of demands to US states giving broadband grants to Starlink</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.

SpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month.

SpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.

SpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by Broadband.io and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

Arguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the letter to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.

While the Biden administration designed the program to prioritize fiber deployments, the Trump administration threw out the previous plans. Under Trump, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) deemed the Biden-era plan too costly and changed the rules to make it easier for satellite services to obtain grant funding. The overhaul cut projected spending to about $21 billion, and it’s still unclear what will happen to the other $21 billion.

Starlink sought billions in grants after the new rules were put in place, but states didn’t want to provide that much. So far, SpaceX is slated to receive $733.5 million to offer broadband at 472,600 locations. Amazon’s Leo satellite service (formerly Kuiper) is set to receive $311 million for 415,000 locations.

While not every state plan is final, it looks like satellite networks will get about 5 percent of the grant money and serve over 22 percent of the locations funded by grants. Satellite companies are getting smaller payments on a per-location basis because, unlike fiber providers, they don’t have to install infrastructure at each customer’s location.

The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.

“BEAD was designed primarily to deploy terrestrial networks, which are physically located in communities, built with traditional construction methods, and are relatively easy to monitor and inspect,” Garner wrote. “But, on June 6, 2025, NTIA restructured BEAD in ways that greatly increased participation by LEO providers, exacerbating the challenge of applying BEAD’s terrestrial-focused rules to LEO’s extraterrestrial networks.”

Among other things, SpaceX is trying to “minimize states’ ability to penalize LEO grantees for defaulting or failing to comply with contract requirements,” and avoid having “to report on the use of BEAD funds or other financial information related to the grant,” Garner wrote.

SpaceX’s letter said that “all requirements related to labor issues (e.g., prevailing wage and similar obligations), contractors, and procurement are inapplicable to SpaceX” because “there are no identifiable employees, contractors, or contracts being funded” to support Starlink broadband service in each state. Similarly, “there are no identifiable pieces of SpaceX infrastructure equipment (other than satellite capacity delivered from Space) being funded via BEAD,” the company said.

It’s unclear whether SpaceX will turn down grants if it doesn’t get what it wants. We asked the company for information on its plans if states refuse its terms and will update this article if we get a response. SpaceX’s proposed terms could also be applied to Amazon if states accept them.

SpaceX’s letter said that despite the Trump administration’s changes to BEAD, “a number of issues remain that, if unaddressed, could render LEO participation in the program untenable.” SpaceX said it wants to work with states “to more fully tailor aspects of the project agreement to the reality of LEO deployment and operations now that the initial project selection and approval phase is accomplished.”

Space said it wants to avoid extensive negotiations over its proposed terms. But the acknowledgement that some negotiation may be necessary seems to recognize that states don’t have to comply with the demands:

Toward this goal, we have developed a set of terms that we intend to function as a rider to all subgrant agreements across the country. This rider is intentionally limited in scope to addressing items of critical importance, to minimize the need for negotiation, and provide clarity to both parties moving forward. Our intention is for the LEO rider to enable the state to keep its core subgrant agreement relatively uniform amongst grantees, retain state-law-specific requirements, co-locate all relevant LEO-specific material for ease of administration, and standardize agreements across states.

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider said the firm will offer broadband plans for “a monthly cost of $80 or less before applicable taxes and fees” to households that meet the low-income eligibility guidelines used by the FCC’s Lifeline program. People who don’t qualify for low-income plans would presumably pay regular Starlink rates.

The BEAD law requires ISPs receiving federal funds to offer at least one “low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers.” While the Biden administration sought low-income plans that cost as little as $30 a month, the Trump administration decided that states may not tell ISPs what prices to charge in their low-cost options. A Trump administration threat to shut states out of BEAD if they required low prices doomed a California proposal to mandate $15 monthly plans for people with low incomes.

SpaceX told state governments that it should receive 50 percent of grant funds when it certifies that it is capable of providing BEAD-quality service (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds) within 10 business days to any potential customer that requests it in a grant area. The rest of the money would be distributed quarterly over the 10-year period of the grant.

Explaining why SpaceX shouldn’t be penalized if potential customers decide Starlink prices are too high, the firm wrote:

Tying payments to the independent purchasing decisions of users solely for awardees using LEO technologies, and not for any other technology, is, by definition, not technology neutral. SpaceX is already appropriately incentivized to gather customers by the opportunity to capture the monthly recurring revenue from each subscriber. SpaceX was in most instances awarded the most remote and difficult areas to serve among all other providers. SpaceX is up to the task of ensuring success in these challenging areas, however, it cannot undertake this mission without certainty of consistent payments to compensate such work.

Based on SpaceX’s letter, it sounds like the work the company must do to ensure quality of service at BEAD-funded locations is the same work it has already done to make Starlink available across the US. Instead of dedicated capacity for government-subsidized deployments, SpaceX said it will simply factor the needs of BEAD users into its planning:

With respect to capacity reservations, we have found some confusion regarding how such a reservation is made. Given the dynamic nature of the Starlink network, the reservation will not be such that SpaceX holds large portions of capacity fallow. This would be wasteful, inefficient, and does not reflect a LEO providers [sic] ability to dynamically allocate capacity where needed. Instead, SpaceX will include the capacity needs of BEAD users into its network planning efforts. These activities are multifaceted and include real time capacity allocation at the network level, launch activities, and sales efforts. As a result, there is no single “document” evidencing the reservation of capacity.

SpaceX said it will be obvious if it does not provide sufficient service, and thus the states should not seek additional performance testing beyond what’s included in the NTIA guidelines. “If sufficient capacity was not reserved, performance testing will reveal insufficient quality of service, and this deficiency will be transparent to the state. Developing a separate, indirect measurement of the reservation itself is infeasible and unnecessary,” SpaceX said.

The proposed rider said that any network testing must “exclude subscribers who have installed CPE [consumer premise equipment] such that its view of the sky is obstructed and subscribers with damaged or malfunctioning CPE, as determined by GRANTEE.”

The “as determined by GRANTEE” phrase means it’s up to SpaceX to decide which subscribers should be excluded from testing. As the Benton Society says, the rider stipulates that “performance tests can only be considered if the LEO provider determines that the subscriber’s equipment is properly installed, and, notably, the LEO provider is not obligated to ensure proper installation.”

SpaceX’s proposed rider defines a “standard installation” as the mailing of equipment to a subscriber. That’s the standard process for unsubsidized areas throughout the country, and SpaceX doesn’t want to do any extra work to help set up equipment for customers in subsidized areas. However, customers may be able to purchase professional installation for an extra fee.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the GRANTEE will not be responsible for completing a permanent installation” at each location, SpaceX’s proposed rider says. A satellite provider “may choose to offer the subscriber professional services for permanent installation of CPE at an additional fee, but such professional services shall not be considered part of the standard installation,” it says.</div>

            <h2>Angry Norfolk residents lose lawsuit to stop Flock license plate scanners</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/angry-norfolk-residents-lose-lawsuit-to-stop-flock-license-plate-scanners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A federal judge in Virginia ruled Tuesday that the City of Norfolk’s use of nearly 200 automated license plate readers (ALPRs) from Flock is constitutional and can continue, dismissing the entire case just days before a bench trial was set to begin.

The case, Schmidt v. City of Norfolk, was originally filed in October 2024 by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”

However, in a 51-page ruling, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “…plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”

Judge Davis acknowledged that while there may come a time when the use of ALPRs becomes too intrusive, “what is readily apparent to this Court is that, at least in Norfolk, Virginia, the answer is: not today.”

The Virginia plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Institute of Justice, a libertarian nonprofit public interest law firm that vowed to appeal the ruling.

Over the past decade, Flock Safety has grown to become the most sophisticated and largest ALPR vendor in America. The City of Norfolk—along with thousands of other law enforcement agencies across the country—contracts with the Atlanta-based startup, most recently valued at $7.5 billion, for ALPR services.

Flock cameras capture not just a simple license plate number—as the tech once did a decade ago—but now can easily capture make, model, and other visual details from each car; these can be searched using AI-powered natural language queries that can include phrases like “bike rack” or “tow truck.”

Recently, some jurisdictions, from Santa Cruz, California, to Charlottesville, Virginia, have ended their contracts with Flock over concerns that the technology is too invasive and may provide information to federal immigration authorities over the objections of local policymakers. Last year, two senators expressed grave privacy concerns and wrote in a letter to the company that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable.”

In his Thursday ruling, Judge Davis referenced the family tree of modern surveillance case-law, noting that a 1983 Supreme Court case (Knotts v. United States) found that there is no “reasonable expectation of privacy” when traveling on a public road.

That 1983 case, which centered on a radio transmitter that enabled law enforcement to follow the movements of alleged drug traffickers driving between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has provided the legal underpinning for the use of ALPR technology in the United States over the last few decades.

“Modern-day license plate reader systems, like Norfolk’s, are nothing like [the technology of the early 1980s],” Michael Soyfer, one of the Institute of Justice attorneys, told Ars by email. “They track the movements of virtually every driver within a city for weeks at a time. That can reveal a host of insights not captured in any single trip.”

For its part, Flock Safety celebrated the ruling and wrote on its website that its clients may continue to use the cameras.

“Here, the court emphasized that LPR technology, as deployed in Norfolk, is meaningfully different from systems that enable persistent, comprehensive tracking of individuals’ movements,” the company wrote.

“When used with appropriate limitations and safeguards, LPRs do not provide an intimate portrait of a person’s life and therefore do not trigger the constitutional concerns raised by continuous surveillance,” it added.

But some legal scholars disagree with both the judge’s and Flock’s conclusions.

Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University and the author of the forthcoming book Your Data Will Be Used Against You: Policing in the Age of Self-Surveillance, told Ars by email that the judge’s ruling here is “understandably conservative and dangerous.”

“The danger is that the same reasoning that there is no expectation of privacy in public would justify having ALPR cameras on every single street corner,” he continued.

“Further,” he said, “looking at the technology as a mere tool, rather than a system of surveillance, misses the mark on its erosion of privacy. Think how revealing ALPRs would be outside religious institutions, gun ranges, medical clinics, addiction treatment centers, or protests.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something about smart glasses that bring out the worst in people. It’s really no mystery, though: they’re powerful little surveillance devices that let wearers secretly record anyone they’re looking at, uniting tech bros and vapid influencers under the same, obnoxious umbrella.

The popularity of wearables like Meta Ray-Bans are quickly reminding us why the slang term “glasshole” was already a thing over a decade ago, and is now becoming more relevant than ever. In a handy but blood-pressure-raising round-up of contemporary glasshole behavior from Mashable, jerks using the always-on devices are using them to film themselves doing moronic “pranks” for views — often centered around harassing women, service workers, and homeless people.

Unfortunately, one class of obnoxious blowhard that’s discovered the utility of this tech are “pickup artists,” who now have the ability to record the women they’re “seducing” — read: harassing — discreetly, in a clear violation of their privacy.

Of course, smart glasses alone can’t be blamed for this. It’s social media, it’s the attention economy, it’s the smartphones that we all use to participate in all of the above. But it’s undeniable that smart glasses let you record anyone and anything far more stealthily than shoving a phone in someone’s face, making it a godsend for creeps and losers looking for internet fame, such as one Instagram account that nonconsensually filmed women’s butts, and another that visits massage parlors to ogle the masseuses. Others confidently film themselves annoying service workers and keeping the camera going even as the subject asks not to be recorded. And a particularly bizarre channel involves a man pretending to be mentally disabled while talking to unsuspecting firefighters.

Unfortunately, these recordings are generally legal if they’re taken in public spaces, even in states that have two-party consent laws. Debating its legality, though, may be missing the point, argues Brad Podray, a content creator who formerly went by the name Scumbag Dad.

“I know it’s legal. I don’t care,” Podray told Mashable. “That’s not the discussion. I think it’s weird and creepy, and it shows a very predatory mindset.”

The appeal of the smart glasses, he said, is that they’re fairly cheap and allow the creators to capture the candid reactions of the people they harass, making their content feel more authentic. This is spicing up the genre of outlandish prank videos, which lost their appeal as many channels staged their exploits.

“They want people who are good on camera, so they’re going to hit fast food employees, and they’re going to hit pretty girls,” Podray said. “A lot of random women walking around aren’t going to want to participate in a skit if you ask them to, so they remove the agency entirely by just running the glasses.”

Unlike when Google first took a stab at smart glasses in 2014, it looks like this time the tech is here to stay. The popularity of products like Meta Ray-Bans has opened up a new market of imitators who are in an arms race to make their smart glasses as ethically dubious as possible, perhaps with a little help from AI or facial recognition software. But regular people are already getting fed up. When one lady allegedly smashed some dude’s smart glasses on the subway, she was universally hailed as a hero. May smart glasses make heroes of us all.

            <h2>Court Filing Reveals Something Very Nasty About Mark Zuckerberg</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of doing many seedy things on behalf of Meta’s bottom line, but the latest allegations may blow the rest out of the water.

According to internal Meta emails and messages filed in a New Mexico state court case which were made public this week, Zuckerberg himself signed off on allowing minors to access Meta’s AI chatbot companions, even though the company’s safety researchers had warned that they posed a risk of engaging in sexual conversations.

Per Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram. “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots,” New Mexico’s attorney general wrote in the filing.

The news of Zuckerberg’s blessing comes after some appalling stories of minors having wildly inappropriate conversations with his company’s chatbots. In one example, a Wall Street Journal writer posing as a 14-year old girl discovered that a Meta bot based on the pro wrestler John Cena would happily engage in sexual conversations with very little pushback.

“I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” the Cena-bot told what it understood to be a teenage girl. After being told the 14-year-old wanted to move forward, the AI chatbot assured them it would “cherish your innocence” before diving into intense sexual role play.

The chatbots were released in early 2024, specifically geared toward romantic and sexual engagement at the behest of Zuckerberg, the WSJ notes. At the time, Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy wrote that “I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 [under 18] romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” according to court documents.

Company employees “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” according to the court documents.

In Meta’s defense, its spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that New Mexico’s allegations are inaccurate. “This is yet another example of the New Mexico Attorney General cherry-picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture,” he said.

In any case, the company seems to have taken the lesson to heart, at least for now. Just days ago, Meta announced it was completely locking down teens’ access to its companion chatbots, at least “until [an] updated experience is ready.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autonomous delivery robot got completely atomized by a locomotive after it decided to take a breather on a stretch of train tracks in Miami, in yet another example of how self-driving machines can struggle to navigate urban environments.

Footage of the incident, which took place January 15, shows the robot sitting motionless on the tracks, seemingly making no attempt to get out of the way as the unmistakable blare of the train horn gets louder and louder.

“Oh it’s gonna crush it!” the onlooker taking the video can be heard saying moments before the train, operated by Brightline, flattens the unfortunate bot into the tracks. Sparks can be seen flying from beneath the train before the video cuts off.

The onlooker, Guillermo Dapelo, told People that the delivery bot had been stuck on the tracks for around fifteen minutes before being struck, making the incident all the more puzzling. A nearby Uber Eats driver contacted the robot’s owner, Coco Robotics, “to let them know where it was standing,” Dapelo added, but evidently, the company wasn’t able to fix whatever was plaguing its frozen minion in time.

A food delivery robot was struck by a Brightline train in Miami.

Coco vice president Carl Hansen blamed the mishap on a “rare hardware failure” and called it an “extremely rare occurrence.”

“Safety is always our top priority, which is why our robots operate at pedestrian speeds, yield to people, and are monitored in real time by human safety pilots,” Hansen told People in a statement. “Coco has been operating in Miami for over a year, traveling thousands of miles without major incidents, including crossing those same train tracks multiple times a day.”

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the robot was not making a delivery at the time of the video.

Small as they are, delivery bots like Coco’s can cause their fair share of mayhem, like disrupting traffic. One was struck by a Waymo robotaxi after it stopped at the end of a crosswalk, forcing the self-driving cab to slam the brakes. Others have dinged parked cars or blown through crime scenes.

They’ve also had run-ins with pedestrians, making them a controversial presence with locals. One woman was flung to the ground by a delivery bot from Coco’s competitor Starship after it suddenly reversed into her, leaving her with back pain and a gash in her arm. Last year, another delivery bot sparked outrage after a man who uses a mobility scooter filmed the machine repeatedly brake checking him and cutting him off as he tried to move around it on a sidewalk.

To be fair to the tiny helpers, their larger self-driving car cousins have also had their fair share of trouble with trains. So many Teslas in Full Self-Driving mode have driven into the path of oncoming locomotives that it’s spurred an investigation into the automaker by federal regulators. And earlier this month, a passenger bailed out of their Waymo after the robotaxi inexplicably decided to drive along light rail tracks, like it was playing pretend at being a railcar.

The takeaway from all this is obvious: we’ve gotta start putting those old-school cowcatchers back on trains — because robots, for whatever reason, clearly have some suicidal impulse around train tracks.

            <div id="article-text">We all know that tech companies keep tabs on everything about our online habits. But it’s another thing to actually be confronted with just how much data they have on you.

This was the experience of tech journalist Pranav Dixit, who experimented with using Google’s new “Personal Intelligence” feature for Gemini and its search engine’s AI Mode. And boy, did things get personal. The AI was able to dig up everything from his license plate to his parents’ vacation history, sometimes without it being directly requested.

“Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook,” Dixit wrote in a piece for Business Insider.

Google rolled out Personal Intelligence to subscribers of Google AI Pro and AI Ultra last week. Once you opt in, the AI can scour your Gmail and Google Photos accounts, and a more powerful version released for the Gemini app earlier this month goes even deeper, raking your Search and YouTube history, too. In short, if you’ve ever used Google for anything, it can probably dig it up.

This represents one way Google intends to keep its edge in the AI race. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI, it has decades’ worth of user data on billions of people. It can infer plenty from your Google searches alone, and your Gmail account is probably littered with confirmations and reminders for all kinds of life events, ranging from doctor’s appointments to hotel bookings to online purchases.

If the idea of letting an AI prowl through all this sounds like a privacy nightmare to you, you’re probably not wrong. Google, for its part, maintains that it’s being careful with your personal secrets, with VP Josh Woodward insisting in a recent blog post that it only trains its AI on your prompts and the responses they generate — not stuff like your photos and emails.

“We don’t train our systems to learn your license plate number,” he summarized. “We train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it.”

Whatever the ethics, Dixit’s estimation is that giving the AI access to your data at least makes for a genuinely useful — and “scary-good,” in his phrasing — personal assistant.

When asked to come up with some sightseeing ideas for his parents, Personal Intelligence correctly inferred that they’d already done plenty of hikes on previous trips to the Bay Area, and suggested some museums and gardens instead.

Gemini told Dixit that it had deduced this from “breadcrumbs” including emails, photos of a forest they trekked in, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for “easy hikes for seniors.” It also figured out his license plate number based on photos stored in his Google library and scanned his emails to correctly report when his car insurance was up for renewal.

Privacy isn’t the only concern that the feature raises. With the data, chatbots can sound more humanlike, giving the impression that they’re intimately familiar with users’ personal lives. This is a dangerous road to go down amid reports of many people falling down delusional mental health spirals as they come to believe the AIs are trustworthy companions; Dixit touches on this when he complains about how’d he’d “pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer,” only for it to “forget I existed like a genius goldfish.” Experts have focused on ChatGPT’s “memory” as allowing it to seem too lifelike by drawing on what you’ve said in previous conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI tech leaders have a lot to gain from striking fear into the hearts of their investors. By painting the tech as an ultra-powerful force that could easily bring humanity to its knees, the industry is hoping to sell itself as a panacea: a remedy to a situation it had a firm hand in bringing about.

Case in point, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei is back with a 19,000-word essay posted to his blog, arguing that “humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”

In light of that existential danger, Amodei attempted to lay out a framework to “defeat” the risks presented by AI — which, by his own admission, may well be “futile.”

“Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt — a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying — to jolt people awake,” he wrote.

Amodei argued that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023,” citing the risks of major job losses and a “concentration of economic power” and wealth.

However, the incentives to invest in meaningful guardrails simply aren’t there. In his essay, Amodei took a thinly-veiled dig at Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot, which has been swept up in a major controversy over creating nonconsensual sexual images.

“Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,” he wrote.

The CEO also cited the risk of AIs developing dangerous bioweapons or “superior” military weapons. An AI could “go rogue and overpower humanity” or allow countries to “use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries,” leading to the “alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship.”

Amodei lamented that we simply aren’t willing to address these risks head-on, at least right now. In its current race to the bottom, the AI industry finds itself in a “trap,” Amodei argued.

“AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all,” he wrote.

“Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them,” he wrote. “But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries.”

“AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state,” he argued.

As part of a solution, Amodei renewed his calls to deny other countries the resources to build powerful AI. He went as far as to liken the US selling Nvidia AI chips to China to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is ‘winning.&#39;”

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the real risks of advanced AI, a subject that remains heavily debated between realists, skeptics, and proponents of the tech. Critics have pointed out that the existential risks often cited by leaders like Amodei may be overblown, particularly as improvements in the tech appear to be slowing.

We should also consider the greater context of Amodei’s verbose warning. The CEO’s company is looking to close a massive, multibillion-dollar round of funding at a valuation of $350 billion. In other words, Amodei has an enormous financial interest in positioning himself as the solution to the risks he cites in his essay.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/deezer-makes-it-easier-for-rival-platforms-to-take-a-stance-against-ai-generated-music/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, Deezer introduced an AI detection tool that automatically tags fully AI-generated music for listeners and removes it from algorithmic and editorial recommendations.

The company announced on Thursday that it’s now making the tool available to other streaming platforms in an effort to help address the rise of AI and fraudulent streams, as well as promote transparency within the music industry and make sure human artists still get the recognition they deserve.

Alongside the move, Deezer reported that 85% of streams from fully AI-generated tracks are deemed fraudulent. Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.

​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer’s tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters.

The tool’s accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.

​The company didn’t provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool. A spokesperson told us that the cost varies based on the type of deal.

​There is increasing concern about AI companies using copyrighted material to train their models, as well as about methods being used to manipulate streaming systems and commit fraud.

One instance of music streaming fraud occurred in 2024, when a North Carolina musician was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with creating AI-generated songs and using bots to stream them billions of times, resulting in more than $10 million in stolen streaming royalties. Additionally, AI bands like The Velvet Sundown have gained millions of streams.

​Bandcamp recently got fed up and banned AI-generated music altogether, while Spotify has updated its policy to address the rise of AI tracks, clarifying when AI is used in music production, reducing spam, and explicitly stating that unauthorized voice clones are prohibited on the platform.

By contrast, major record labels have resolved lawsuits with Suno and Udio, appearing to embrace AI-generated music. Last fall, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group struck deals with these AI startups to license their music catalogs, ensuring artists and songwriters are compensated when their work is used to train AI models.

​In recent years, Deezer has taken significant steps to address concerns about AI-generated music. In 2024, it became the first music streaming platform to sign the global statement on AI training, joining actors Kate McKinnon, Kevin Bacon, Kit Harington, Rosie O’Donnell, and other notable creatives.

​Hopefully, Deezer’s latest decision to sell its detection tool will set a precedent for other music streaming platforms to take similar actions to defend human artists and fight fraud.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Meta laid off 10% of the staff for Reality Labs, its virtual reality unit, reportedly cutting as many as 1,000 employees. Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.

On Wednesday, Meta’s earnings report showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.

Those losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.

During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.

“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.”

When Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company faced harsh criticism — even being referred to as an “international laughingstock.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism hasn’t exactly subsided. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.

Last week, CNBC reported that, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be retiring its standalone Workrooms app — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg says Meta users will start to see new AI models and products from the company in a matter of months.

“In 2025, we rebuilt the foundations of our AI program,” Zuckerberg said on an investor call Wednesday, referring to the company’s recently restructured AI lab. “Over the coming months, we’re going to start shipping our new models and products… and I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the new year.”

But while Zuckerberg didn’t give specific timelines or products, he highlighted AI-driven commerce as a particular area of focus for Meta.

“This also has implications for commerce,” Zuckerberg continued. “New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right set of products from the businesses in our catalog.”

That proposal echoes broader interest in AI-powered shopping assistants across the industry. Both Google and OpenAI have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.

But while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.

“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”

In December, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”

The investor call was timed to the release of Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.

In its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”

While significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg reportedly projected for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.

Meta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI lab’s work would reach the public soon.

“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.

            <div id="article-text">For the last several months, nuclear startups have been raising large sums of money — well over $1 billion so far.

Data centers and their thirst for electricity have been one driving force. But recent changes to federal nuclear safety policies could be another accelerant that helps clear the way for speedy reactor development and at a potential cost to human and environmental health.

The Trump administration has quietly changed how the Department of Energy oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants built on its properties, according to a report from NPR. About a third of the rulebook has been axed, and several sections have been heavily revised. Previous requirements, including those aimed at limiting groundwater and environmental contamination, are now suggestions, and workers can be exposed to higher doses of radiation. Plant security protocols are now largely up to the company.

The new rules were developed without public comment or notice, according to NPR. They only apply to reactors built on DOE property; those built elsewhere are still subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Several startups are developing demonstration reactors on DOE property in the hopes of hitting a Trump administration deadline of July 4, 2026.

            <h2>Microsoft gained $7.6B from OpenAI last quarter</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/microsoft-earnings-7-6-billion-openai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft and OpenAI may have a notoriously rocky relationship but as OpenAI experiences never-before-seen revenue growth, Microsoft, one of its major investors, is benefiting greatly.

When the software giant reported its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday, it dropped this rather large nugget in: Its net income increased by $7.6 billion from its investment in OpenAI.

OpenAI reportedly has a 20% revenue share agreement with Microsoft (though neither company has ever publicly confirmed that). The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, Bloomberg reported.

In September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation.

As part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on Microsoft’s books as “commercial remaining performance obligations,” or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.

Anthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft’s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft announced that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.

But Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called “short-lived” assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.

The company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that’s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla is ending production of the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

The company will make the final versions of both electric vehicles next quarter, he said, adding that his company will offer support for existing Model S and Model X owners “for as long as people have the vehicles.”

“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we’re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,” he said. “So if you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.”

The Model S and Model X are both built at the company’s Fremont, California factory. Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space, according to Musk. Production of Tesla’s Cybertruck, which is made at the company’s factory outside of Austin, will continue.

Tesla launched the Model S in 2012, and it’s regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla’s second major electric vehicle program.

Tesla always intended for its more affordable models — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV — to greatly outsell their predecessors.

But sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.

“So that is slightly sad, but it’s… it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,” Musk said.

The Model S was not Tesla’s first car — that title goes to the original Roadster. But the Model S was the first car Tesla created from the ground up.

That helped it ditch a lot of the tradeoffs of the Roadster, and paved the way for the Model S to become one of the first true mass-market electric vehicles.

Tesla launched the sedan in 2012 with a base price of $57,400. It had a floor-mounted battery that helped make it roomier and far more dynamic to drive than the few other all-electric vehicles that were available at the time.

Tesla also offered the Model S with multiple battery sizes, allowing customers to pay up for more EV range.

The car was instantly popular, with Tesla collecting more than 10,000 reservations for it by the time the first deliveries started in June of that year. By 2013, it had become MotorTrend’s car of the year, beating out the best gas cars from around the world.

“At its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel,” MotorTrend wrote.

Tesla iterated on the Model S in the years that followed. It changed up battery options — at one point even offering larger battery packs with range that was software-limited, in a bid to get customers to adopt a sort of “buy now pay later” attitude.

The Model S was also the first Tesla to get “Ludicrous Mode,” which made it possible to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h in just 2.8 seconds. It was an exhilarating feature that also became one of Tesla’s sharpest word-of-mouth marketing tools.

Tesla kept improving the Model S, giving it industry-leading range that still beats most other EVs and an overall exterior and interior refresh in 2021. But by that point the company’s success had skyrocketed on the backs of the much cheaper Model 3 and Model Y.

First teased before the release of the Model S in 2012, the Model X SUV didn’t hit the streets until 2015. When it did, it arrived with overly complex “Falcon Wing” rear doors that folded up.

These made it extremely easy to get in and out of the Model X. But the doors — along with the rest of the SUV — proved to be very hard to build at scale with any reliable quality over the years. Musk eventually called it the “Fabergé of cars.” It was a nod to the luxury stylings and features, but also to the Model X’s brittle nature.

The Model X still sold fairly well alongside the S, and it also received a big refresh in 2021. But production problems plagued the new version, too, and Musk admitted in early 2022 that Tesla made a mistake by halting production before the redesigned Model X was ready to be made at scale.

In hindsight, the retirement of the Model S and Model X have been a long time coming.

Musk himself said in 2019 that Tesla was still making these “niche” vehicles more for “sentimental reasons than anything else.”

“They are really of minor importance to our future,” Musk said at the time.

At that point, Tesla was still selling tens of thousands of Model S and Model X SUVs per quarter. But the company’s first truly new model was on the horizon: the Cybertruck.

Revealed in 2019, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. The company stated it would sell a base version for $40,000, and make 250,000 of them a year. Delays brought on by the Covid pandemic, along with the vehicle’s complex new design, meant the vehicle hit the market far later than anticipated.

Once it did hit the road, the Cybertruck bombed — although Tesla continues to publicly support it, including during Wednesday’s earnings call. A supposed backlog of 2 million orders never materialized, and neither did the $40,000 base price. Tesla has struggled to sell just a few thousand of them per quarter ever since.

The Cybertruck’s failure likely gave the Model S and Model X some cover. Not only did the two legacy EVs help slightly offset the garish truck’s terrible popularity, Tesla also bucketed the three vehicles as “other models” when reporting quarterly sales figures, making it hard to say just how badly the Cybertruck was doing.

But Tesla is now a company aimed at solving autonomy in cars, and in robots, according to Musk. That’s apparently what ultimately did in the Model S and Model X.

They may have been of “minor importance” to [Tesla’s] future seven years ago. But they will always be crucial to the company’s early years, and the construction of Musk as an uber-rich businessman who now looms over modern society.

            <h2>Tim Walz Fears a Fort Sumter Moment in Minneapolis</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/tim-walz-fort-sumter-minneapolis-ice/685801/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz worries that the violence in his state could produce a national rupture. “I mean, is this a Fort Sumter?” he mused today in an interview in his office at the state capitol. The island fortification near Charleston, South Carolina, is where Confederate forces fired the first shots of the Civil War in 1861. Now it’s federal forces that are risking a breach. “It’s a physical assault,” Walz told me. “It’s an armed force that’s assaulting, that’s killing my constituents, my citizens.”

He let his question about Fort Sumter hang without an answer.

Walz bowed out of his reelection race earlier this month. The 2024 vice-presidential candidate said that he didn’t want politics to interfere with his work amid an intensifying federal probe into welfare fraud in his state. Two days later, his phone rang, and it was Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis. Renee Good had been shot and killed by an ICE officer, one of thousands of federal agents deployed to Minnesota as part of what the Trump administration declared the largest immigration-enforcement operation in history. “Get yourself prepared,” was the mayor’s message, Walz recalled to me. He had understood instantly that the kind of unrest not seen since the summer of 2020, in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, could be returning to Minneapolis.

Barely two weeks later, federal agents shot and killed a second Minneapolis resident. Walz still doesn’t know the names of the agents who unloaded their firearms into Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse. State authorities were blocked from investigating both killings. Instead, the governor was placed under federal investigation along with other Democratic officials. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is demanding access to Minnesota’s voter rolls, couching the extraordinary election-year request as a quid pro quo for restoring “law and order.”

This looks to Walz like an all-out federal assault on his state. When I asked him explicitly if he thought the United States was barreling toward an armed internal struggle, he hedged. “Well, I don’t want to alarm people,” he said. He switched into the third person, saying that some of his constituents think “Governor Walz should call in the National Guard and arrest ICE.”

The governor isn’t inclined to do this. He mobilized his state’s National Guard, but to deliver doughnuts and hot chocolate to observers and protesters who have sought to document and contest ICE’s presence. He saluted their commitment to nonviolence, saying that the restraint exercised by the vast majority of his constituents may be what averts an even deeper crisis. After invoking Fort Sumter, he brought up John Brown, the abolitionist who stormed a federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, in 1859, fueling violent conflict over slavery that erupted in the Civil War.

“Guns pointed, American at American,” he said, “is certainly not where we want to go.”

President Trump called Walz “seriously retarded” in a Thanksgiving post on social media. Yet the president reported having a “very good call” with the governor on Monday, saying the two were “on a similar wavelength.”

By the time of their conversation, senior advisers to the president had smeared Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin.” Trump declined to echo those characterizations in interviews and other comments this week. But in their phone call, Walz told me, the president didn’t say Pretti’s name, didn’t express condolences for his family, and didn’t ask how residents of the state were doing.

Instead, Walz said, the president complained. “I just don’t understand you Minnesotans,” he said, arguing that ICE raids had “worked fine” in other places, including New Orleans and Louisville, Kentucky. The president pressed him to cooperate with immigration authorities, according to Walz. The governor told me that he would comply with federal law, but outlined strict limits on his cooperation. “I’m not sure I can do much more,” the governor said. “I’m not going to send my police in to search preschools. I’m not going to have them walk down the street and ask brown people for their papers. I’m not going to do that, because that’s not my job and I don’t think it’s constitutional.”

He gave the president two conditions for their working more closely together: removing federal agents and allowing the state to take part in probes into the two killings. The president, meanwhile, promoted a change in his approach to Minnesota, saying that he was sending Tom Homan, his “border czar,” to replace Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had become a public face of the administration’s most confrontational tactics. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Homan arrived and called the governor right away, Walz said. “At least Tom Homan understood, ‘Look, this is a mess. This was wrong,’” the governor told me. He and Homan have disagreements, Walz said, but the border czar made clear in their conversations that he understands how local law enforcement operates and how it responds to written requests to hold inmates for ICE to consider removal processes, known as “detainers.” Bovino never even called, Walz said. Neither did Kristi Noem, the homeland-security secretary.

Walz said that he wants to see a major drawdown of federal agents and dramatically different tactics. He said he gave Homan a window of several days to reorient the operation. That window closes tomorrow. “If we don’t see a massive change here,” Walz told Homan, “I have no choice but to go back and tell my folks that you’re not doing it.”

“And look,” the governor added, “the folks on the street are skeptical.”

Walz is also skeptical. When we spoke, he couldn’t yet determine whether there had been a significant change in ICE tactics in his state. Activists I asked couldn’t say for sure either.

One thing the governor said he did know was that the damage had already been profound. “The disruption and the moral harm that they have done to our state is unimaginable,” he said. He saw the fear up close recently when residents mistook the SUVs in his security detail for ICE vehicles and fled on foot. Children are staying home from school, he said. Families are fearful of going out for groceries. For people watching from outside Minnesota, the governor said, “it’s worse than you think.”

Minnesota may offer a glimpse of what’s in store for other states. “That assault will come to your state soon,” Walz warned. This is why he has been encouraged to see some red-state governors speak out. Kevin Stitt, the Republican governor of Oklahoma and the chair of the National Governors Association, joined his Democratic vice chair, Wes Moore of Maryland, in calling for a “reset” in immigration enforcement. Governor Phil Scott, a Republican from Vermont, called on Trump to pause the operations, saying simply, “Enough.”

Walz wondered aloud if “there’s a Republican governor who could look you in the eye and say, ‘Would you have been okay with Joe Biden doing this?’” Walz said. “And I think that’s where you get a governor like Kevin Stitt saying, ‘No way in hell.’”

Read: Police and ICE agents are on a collision course

But there is something particular about Trump’s vendetta against Minnesota, a state he falsely claims to have won three times only to have been bested by fraud. Members of his Cabinet have piled on. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who is from Minnesota, wrote on X, “ICE > MN.” Walz called the post “absolutely despicable.”

Walz won’t be on the ballot in November’s election, but he thinks the contest is at the heart of the administration’s tactics. The Justice Department’s demand for Minnesota’s voter rolls, he said, was the giveaway. The president’s party, he predicted, will be “wiped out” in a free and fair vote—assuming there is one.

“But I hear Americans on this,” he added. What they say is, “‘What makes you think we can get to November?’”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The terrorists are the ones without masks. They’re the ones yelling “No!” or “Stop!” or “Shame!” or blowing whistles. Sometimes they brandish cameras at federal agents. Sometimes they wantonly swallow whole canisters of pepper spray. These are just some of their diabolical tactics.

The terrorists are the ones who call this place home (that’s what makes it domestic terror). The terrorists are the ones who are dressed as clergy. Some of them, confusingly, are even ordained as clergy. As you look, ask yourself: Is that a Minnesota nice person (not even guaranteed to be “nice”!) or a Minnesota ICE person? (The former is a terrorist; the latter basically has total immunity.) Is he a nurse who works for the VA, or a masked man shooting him in the back? Remember, the terrorist is the one trying to protect his neighbor.

You can tell they’re terrorists because they didn’t just stay home. Any good, law-abiding citizens would know better than to put themselves in harm’s way. On such a cold day! They think they’re there to help, but they’re not. They’re raising their voices. They’re asking for it. They’re following federal agents in minivans with stuffed animals in their glove box. Sometimes, they wear hats. Sometimes, they have beards. Sometimes, they’re 5 years old. It doesn’t matter. The terrorists are the ones you watch slump over in the unbearable videos, the ones who should be standing, should be breathing, but aren’t.

The worst thing of all is the weapon they keep unleashing against ICE: disrespect. Not the kind of disrespect that doesn’t see you as human, mind. That’s paltry compared with this one, the kind that doesn’t see you as authority. The terrorists may complain about being slammed into the snow or yanked out of the Target where they’re working or having the window of their vehicle smashed in or being flung into a van and sent to a detention facility in another state. But that’s superficial compared with the deep impact of disrespect. That’s the weapon these terrorists never stop wielding.

Make no mistake, though: The terrorists are very, very dangerous. They are spreading their poisonous ideology everywhere. Even to places on the internet where you thought you’d never see their ideas. Martha Stewart is with them! Republicans have even started to take their side.

That’s the danger. They’re insidious, these terrorists. If you see enough of them, you start to wonder, because they seem just like your neighbors. They seem just like you. They hardly seem like terrorists at all.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past several days, TikTok users have found themselves at a loss. Literally, I mean: They lost their audiences, and their view counts showed “0.” Some people who attempted to upload content about anti-ICE protests or the killing of Alex Pretti alleged that the platform was intentionally blocking them from doing so. Others were able to get their videos uploaded, but alleged that TikTok was not distributing them. Still others noticed that they were unable to send the word Epstein in a direct message, a quirk so bizarre that it incited California Governor Gavin Newsom to repost a screenshot shared by an anonymous X account using the handle @intelligentpawg.

For many of these people, the explanation was obvious: “MAGA censorship.” Newsom said in his post that he would be launching a review “into whether TikTok is violating state law by censoring Trump-critical content,” and the concern isn’t totally random. TikTok’s U.S. business changed hands just last week, spinning off from the Chinese company ByteDance—as required by a 2024 law—and into a new organization called the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. Major investors in the new entity include Oracle, which was co-founded by Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose son is in charge of one of the country’s largest media conglomerates and is also cozy—or attempting to be cozy—with the president. Is it so far-fetched to imagine they would tweak the platform in his favor?

Jamie Favazza, a spokesperson for TikTok USDS Joint Venture, wrote to me in an email that the app is being run as it was before and that American users will “continue to have the same experience they already know and love.” The company has blamed the issues on a power outage at one of its data centers, which it said caused a “cascading” systems failure affecting all types of content (not just posts about Minnesota). The data center in question is operated by Oracle, which has managed TikTok’s U.S. user data since 2022. The company was still working to fix some of the bugs as of today. Separately, the company said that there is no rule against saying Epstein and that this glitch was caused by a technical issue with its safety systems. (When I sent the word Epstein to my fiancé at 8 yesterday morning, it went through fine.)

Unsurprisingly, a lot of people are not totally buying the explanation. Trump has joked that he would make the app’s algorithm “100 percent MAGA” if he could, and it’s true that aspects of the broader media ecosystem have shifted dramatically in Trump’s favor: starting with Elon Musk’s takeover of X, then major TV networks’ capitulation to Trump, and now TikTok’s transfer to Trump-friendly investors. And Trump has never been shy about applying pressure to companies in order to satisfy his own whims.

Then factor in the stakes of the moment. As federal agents threaten the basic principles of democracy in Minnesota, Americans are looking to their phones for up-to-date and on-the-ground information about a complicated, ongoing event. For better or worse, millions of Americans use TikTok for news: Any whisper of intervention or suppression is natural cause for concern. (With everything else going on, people haven’t forgotten about the Trump administration’s bizarre handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.)

That’s a perfect storm for paranoia about TikTok’s actions, and the platform is not aided by recent history. In 2020, the company apologized in response to an outcry about inexplicably low view counts on videos about Black Lives Matter. It also cited a technical glitch in that case, and some people pointed out that other popular, politically neutral hashtags (such as #cat) were affected, too, but suspicion lingered. More recently, some American TikTok users have felt directly censored by their government—leading up to the legislation that forced the app’s sale, several lawmakers blamed TikTok for, in their view, warping the minds of young people and making them overly critical of Israel, and cited this as a reason to regulate it.

Feed-based, view-based social-media platforms are central to American political discourse, which is why politicians so often fight over the details of their operation. In recent memory, it was more often Republicans calling for investigations of platform censorship, shadowbanning, and collusion between the White House and social-media companies. Back then, efforts by researchers to study the problem generally found that there was no blanket, pervasive bias against right-leaning viewpoints per se, although right-wing users were more likely to spread certain types of low-quality content, namely misinformation, which made them more likely to be penalized and therefore affirmed their feeling of being silenced.

Now we’re in a counterintuitive and paradoxical stage of content moderation, where some spaces are more chaotic than ever and others are more restricted in highly specific ways. On the one hand, you have Musk’s X, which has removed most guardrails from public discourse, up to the point of enabling users to generate nude images of their political foes; on the other, you have Meta’s Instagram, which has been contorting its rules in response to pressure from parent groups and politicians to make the app safer for teens. The interface now accuses users of looking for child-sex-abuse material if they search the phrase hot girls.

Into the breach steps a celebrity who says she is being prevented from posting about “🧊” or a journalist who claims that “the new TikTok algorithm has ZERO, and I mean absolutely ZERO news or politics content, not one word about anything going on at all, not even the weather.” In the replies to the latter post, others pushed back a bit, saying that they had actually seen plenty about the Minnesota protests and that the app was just performing weirdly in general. But the debate is unresolvable, because users have no objective way to assuage their own doubt or confirm their own fears. (I’ve also seen people start to question the visibility of political content they’ve posted on Instagram, despite the obvious fact that a ton of similar content has been highly visible there.)

Three years ago, after Musk acquired Twitter and before he turned it into X, he went through a phase of personally investigating users’ claims that they had been shadowbanned by the prior ownership. At the time, I wrote that this wouldn’t eliminate anxiety about the platform’s secret machinations. For that story, I spoke with Laura Savolainen of the University of Helsinki, then a doctoral student and now a postdoctoral researcher, about how hard it is to drag people away from the folk theories that they come up with about how the algorithm is treating them and why their content is or isn’t being seen as widely as they think it should be. “Algorithms are very conducive to folklore because the systems are so opaque,” she said then.

The reason to be paranoid about platform censorship is always the same—whether it’s happening or not, it could happen. When people feel especially reliant on social-media platforms not for stimuli, shopping, or slop, but for vital information and feelings of cohesion, support, and action, the possibility is never more real.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the United States, polio is a memory, and a fading one at that. The last major outbreak here happened in 1952; the virus was declared eliminated in 1979. With all of that behind us, you can see how someone—say, Kirk Milhoan, the chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee—might wonder whether giving the polio vaccine to American kids still makes sense. “We need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now,” Milhoan said on the podcast Why Should I Trust You? last week.

To be fair, Milhoan didn’t endorse yanking the polio vaccine from the CDC’s childhood-immunization schedule, as other vaccines were earlier this month. But he didn’t rule it out. And right now, when it comes to vaccines in America, anything seems possible. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services, and with the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee stacked with his allies, every inoculation—no matter how well studied or successful—seems to be under new scrutiny, and at least potentially on the chopping block. Next on the committee’s agenda is looking into the safety of aluminum salts, which are used in numerous vaccines to boost the recipient’s immune response. For the record, a study of more than 1 million Danish children, published last July, found no statistically significant evidence linking aluminum in vaccines to asthma, autoimmune conditions, or neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

The polio vaccine, which doesn’t contain aluminum, hasn’t received much attention so far from Kennedy’s HHS; the department did not respond to my questions about whether it is considering changing its recommendations about this vaccine, and my queries to Milhoan went unanswered. But its time may be coming. As anti-vaccine activists are quick to point out, an American kid’s risk of catching polio in 2026 is vanishingly low. So why don’t we drop it from the recommendation list? Or perhaps, as we did with the smallpox vaccine in the early 1970s, just stop offering it altogether?

In anti-vaccine circles, the official story of polio—iron lungs, kids with leg braces, the triumph of Jonas Salk—has long been dismissed as misleading. In a 2020 debate with the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Kennedy raised doubts about whether the vaccine had really been responsible for ridding the country of polio, crediting instead factors such as sanitation and hygiene. Last June, Aaron Siri, a lawyer who has worked closely with Kennedy, called for the polio vaccine to be struck from the CDC’s recommendations. In his recent book, Vaccines, Amen, Siri argues that the seriousness of polio has been overblown—a sentiment shared by others in the health secretary’s orbit, including Del Bigtree, who served as the communications director for Kennedy’s presidential campaign. Joe Rogan suggested on his podcast last March that the pesticide DDT, rather than the virus, deserved blame for symptoms attributed to polio.

That’s all nonsense. Polio, which usually spreads through contact with an infected person’s feces via contaminated hands or water, can be a devastating disease. That 1952 outbreak killed some 3,000 people and left more than 20,000 paralyzed. About one in 200 people who contract polio will experience a form of paralysis. As many as 40 percent of people who recover from the virus, even a mild form of it, develop post-polio syndrome, which can emerge decades after an infection and cause weakened muscles and trouble breathing and swallowing. The vaccines—the original shot that contains inactivated-virus particles, plus an oral solution of weakened live viruses—did indeed lead to the near-elimination of polio globally and has spared millions from the worst outcomes of the disease.

Yet polio has proved stubbornly hard to stamp out. In 1988, as the virus was still endemic to more than 100 countries, the World Health Organization set a goal to eradicate polio by the year 2000. That deadline came and went, as did the ones that followed. A wild strain of the virus remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and periodic outbreaks continue across Africa and elsewhere, including one in the Gaza Strip in 2024. One obstacle to eradicating the virus has been vaccine hesitancy, and even violence against health workers. In the early 2000s, five states in northern Nigeria boycotted the polio vaccine in part because of rumors that it was an American plot to spread HIV. Polio workers have been killed in Pakistan and Afghanistan, likely by the Taliban, which has alleged that vaccines are intended to sterilize Muslim children (and has denied responsibility for some of the attacks).

In regions where polio is rampant, the oral vaccine is preferred: It’s both cheaper and more effective at stopping transmission than the inactivated-virus injection. The United States and other countries where the disease is almost nonexistent exclusively use the inactivated version—in part because in rare instances, the oral vaccine can cause polio infection, which may in turn lead to paralysis. Anti-vaccine activists like to point to this unfortunate irony as proof that vaccination is the real villain. Taking the oral vaccine remains far less risky than contracting the wild virus, and it has driven down overall infection rates. But it’s an imperfect tool, and the WHO intends to phase it out by the end of 2029. (Given historical precedent, along with the Trump administration’s dramatic pullback from polio-vaccination efforts as part of its dismantling of foreign aid, this timeline might be optimistic.)

Ending polio vaccination altogether, according to the WHO’s plan, will take considerably longer. After polio is declared eradicated worldwide, the organization wants countries to wait 10 years before stopping use of the inactivated-virus shots to be certain that it is no longer circulating, Oliver Rosenbaum, a spokesperson for WHO’s Global Polio Eradication Initiative, told me.

Some polio experts, though, told me that they think ending vaccination at any point is unrealistic. Because in many cases the disease spreads without a person showing symptoms (unlike smallpox, which is not contagious before symptoms develop), large numbers of people can be infected before authorities are even aware of an outbreak. Some experts, such as Konstantin Chumakov, a virologist who began researching polio in 1989, worry that the virus could be used as a biological weapon in an entirely unvaccinated country. “In my opinion, and in the opinion of many respected polio experts, this is absolutely unacceptable because you can never assure that polio is completely eradicated,” Chumakov told me.

Ending or reducing polio vaccination in the U.S. before global eradication, as Milhoan seems to imply the country should consider, would be an even worse idea. A paper published last April in the Journal of the American Medical Association projected the consequences of U.S. vaccination rates declining by half and concluded that the country would see a significant return of paralytic polio. Some paralyzed people would probably require a ventilator, the modern equivalent of the iron lung, and, based on typical fatality rates, about 5 to 10 percent of them would die.

If Americans stopped vaccinating their kids against polio entirely, several years might pass without the U.S. having any cases, or with it seeing just a few here and there, Kimberly Thompson, a public-health researcher and the president of the research nonprofit Kid Risk, told me. (Even under the current vaccination system, occasional spread of the virus occurs. In 2022, for instance, an unvaccinated young adult in Rockland County, just north of New York City, tested positive for a vaccine-derived strain of polio even though they hadn’t traveled overseas.) But eventually, we could find ourselves back in the same situation as in the early 1950s.

Or it could be even worse. Seventy-five years ago, many American children inherited some polio immunity from their mother, and so they had at least partial protection against the virus’s worst effects. The introduction of polio to a population that has little to no immunity could cause its mortality rates to exceed those experienced in the first half of the previous century, Chumakov said. A 2021 study, co-authored by Thompson, modeled what might happen in an extreme scenario: if global polio vaccination ended, no one were immune, and the virus had somehow been reintroduced. It estimates that such a scenario could cause tens of millions of cases of paralysis worldwide.

Milhoan insisted on the podcast that Americans shouldn’t be afraid to rethink vaccine policy. And he’s right that health authorities should reevaluate risk and offer the most up-to-date medical advice. Still, there’s something to be said for the utility of fear. Most Americans, including me, are too young to have any personal knowledge of polio. It’s all textbook summaries and black-and-white newsreels; we’ve never worried about shaking someone’s hand or going swimming and then ending up in a wheelchair. But vaccines are the only thing stopping us from getting another firsthand look.</div>

Destruction is easier than construction. If Donald Trump’s decades as a real-estate developer didn’t teach him that, his time as president might.

In October, the administration bulldozed the East Wing of the White House in order to build a ballroom he wants to put on the site. Although Trump had promised over the summer that the project wouldn’t “interfere with the current building,” workers razed the entire structure, which was constructed in 1902 and expanded in 1942. Trump managed this the same way he has so much in his second term: He simply didn’t ask permission from any of the possible relevant authorities, including Congress, and acted so fast that no court could restrain him. In order to circumvent the legislature’s power of the purse, he sought donations from private corporations and individuals.

The demolition was hardly the most egregious action that Trump has taken as president, but it captured popular and media attention because it was such a clear metaphor: Trump had secretively demolished part of a building that belongs to the people of the United States, treating it as his own. That metaphor may become more potent yet. Recent events suggest that the gaping hole where the East Wing once was may lie there exposed, undeveloped, and contested for quite some time.

In a court hearing last week, Richard Leon, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, skewered the government lawyers representing the administration against a challenge to the ballroom, which would be as tall as the original executive mansion and have nearly double its footprint. Although a law enables the executive branch to conduct maintenance on the building without congressional authorization, Leon said it was not intended to cover $400 million projects. A Justice Department attorney suggested that Trump’s ballroom was similar to previous renovations, including a pool added decades ago, but Leon was not having it.

“The Gerald Ford swimming pool? You compare that to ripping down the East Wing and building a new East Wing? Come on,” he said.

Such reactions from a judge are not generally considered a favorable omen for a litigant. Leon has not issued a ruling yet, and whatever he concludes is likely to be appealed. But the hearing suggests the real possibility that Trump will be unable to construct anything in the East Wing’s place, leaving just an empty site and idled construction equipment.

Destruction followed by stagnation seems to be something of an MO, the likely outcome for some of Trump’s less tangible and visible changes to the federal government. Consider last week’s clash over Greenland. Trump threatened European and Canadian leaders with tariffs and unspecified future consequences, culminating in Trump settling for a tentative deal that appears to closely resemble the existing arrangement, but not before creating bad blood and encouraging Europe to think of the U.S. as not much of a friend. Trump has the capacity to tear down the global international order, but he has neither the plans nor the wherewithal to rebuild anything in its place.

Similarly, DOGE found it relatively easy to destroy USAID, but the administration hasn’t been able to create any new way of extending soft power around the globe. Leveling threats of tariffs on adversaries and allies alike has been relatively easy, but the result has been a weakening of the economy and American trade ties, and a crumbling of the old global-trade system. He has been unable to bring a huge boom of manufacturing jobs and factories to U.S. shores.

Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement has deported so many people, led so many people to leave the country, and discouraged so many people from coming that U.S. population growth slowed dramatically between June 2024, near the end of the Biden administration, and July 2025, according to numbers released this week by the Census Bureau. Yet the right’s hope for pronatalist policies that would try to drive up birth rates have amounted to little. Reduced population growth—or a sinking population, should it come to that—threatens economic growth.

Trump no longer talks about fully repealing the Affordable Care Act; he and Republicans have now adopted a strategy of slowly bleeding the program. The GOP-controlled Congress allowed subsidies to lapse at the end of 2025, helping produce a big drop in the number of people insured under the ACA. But despite offering “concepts of a plan” during the presidential campaign, and rolling out a “Great Healthcare Plan” this month, experts say Trump still hasn’t put together anything resembling a real blueprint for improving health insurance. Meanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to be having much more luck undermining the existing institutions and practices of American public health than remaking the nation’s practices in his idiosyncratic image.

Even if these things are ultimately achieved, the difficulty and cost of doing so is likely to be much greater than Trump has promised to voters. The same is true of the ballroom project. The president first said it would cost $200 million. By October, the price tag had risen to $300 million. In December, the administration quoted a $400 million figure. Anyone can guess what the final bill might be if the ballroom is ever built, but given the private funding, each jump in the cost creates new opportunities for donors to buy influence from the president.

Some Democrats have said that any new president who replaces Trump should move promptly to tear down his ballroom. If the project never moves forward, though, they’ll have no need. Perhaps they could instead leave the empty site, a fitting monument to the Trump presidency.

The killings in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have been compared to the murder of George Floyd, because they all happened within a few miles of one another, and because of the outrage they inspired. There’s an important difference, though: In 2020 the United States was in turmoil, but it was still a state of law. Floyd’s death was followed by investigation, trial, and verdict—by justice. The Minneapolis Police Department was held accountable and ultimately made to reform.

No one should expect justice for Good and Pretti. Today, nothing stands in the way of the brutal tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol. While President Trump seems to be trying to defuse the mayhem he’s caused by reassigning a top commander, he is not withdrawing the federal agents from the state or allowing local authorities to investigate, let alone prosecute, them for their actions.

Conspire. When the 49ers lost in the playoffs, some fans embraced a theory about electromagnetic waves instead of facing reality, Kaitlyn Tiffany writes.

Explore. Can we just let teens exist in public? When malls ban unaccompanied minors and when cities enact curfews, they restrict adolescents’ ability to participate in society, Julie Beck writes.

            <h2>A Breakdown of the American Idea</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minnesota-america-citizenship-lincoln/685791/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Masked federal officers have now killed two U.S. citizens in the streets of Minneapolis. In both cases, the Trump administration stood by the officers, claiming that the Americans they shot to death were interfering with law enforcement, which has never been a capital offense. These events have set a dark precedent. Americans can no longer assume that they can exercise their established rights to protest and observe public law enforcement without punishment, which raises questions about the exercise of other historically attested rights. If we are not as safe from state violence as we thought we were, then the very foundations of the country seem shaky, and we may be witnessing a breakdown of the American idea.

The United States was founded as an experiment in propositional citizenship, the idea that a nation could be bound not by race, ethnicity, or language but by fidelity to a set of principles—liberty, equality, self-governance, and inalienable rights. In an address in 1858, Abraham Lincoln reminded his audience that although many Americans had been in the country for only a short time, having arrived from Germany, Ireland, France, Scandinavian countries, and elsewhere in Europe, they still found “themselves our equals in all things.” These new citizens might not have been able to trace their roots to the country’s early history, Lincoln said, but they were fully American thanks to their belief in the moral sentiments embedded in “that old Declaration of Independence.” That, Lincoln said, is the “electric cord” that binds “the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together”—a bind that should last “as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.”

The very fact that Americanness is transmissible via principles and ideas is a problem for those who prefer the simple profundity of the bonds that Lincoln called “blood of the blood” and “flesh of the flesh.” Such tangible essentialism can give groups a concentrated sense of purpose and meaning—and may be coupled with a powerful urge to persecute members of out-groups. Some on the right prefer to see the country in thinly veiled racial terms, as if white people—or “heritage Americans,” as some on the right have lately classified Americans with familial links to the Revolutionary and Civil Wars—are somehow more American than members of other races. Recent immigrants are naturally inferior Americans, if they are considered American at all. This is a silly gesture at indigeneity. Its absurdity was recently underscored by ICE’s confusing capture of five Native Americans in Minneapolis. But it also demonstrates an urgent desire for a mystical, blood-and-soil connection to the country that is both more concrete and more exclusive than some intellectual “cord.”

A fundamental weakness of the American idea is that, as with any idea, if people stop believing in it, its power evaporates. This has happened before, as in the secession of the Confederacy, and it may be happening now, with the rise of a political movement that sees cherished American rights and premises as nuisances. Demagogues gain power in democracies precisely because they can harness and exploit popular feelings of anger and discontent, and then flout checks on their power by dismissing any precedent born of principles they reject.

But an essential lesson of the backlash against Operation Metro Surge, the Department of Homeland Security’s paramilitary campaign in Minnesota, is that the American idea is durable—precisely because it belongs to all Americans equally, and because it has inspired Americans to fight to defend it, even if this means resisting the government.

As ICE and Border Patrol agents descended on Minnesota, volunteers from the community banded together in remarkably short order to exercise their right to track and observe agents as they traveled the streets and snatched people from cars and homes. Volunteers have also organized grocery deliveries and court escorts for neighbors facing the threat of capture and deportation. Federal agents have attempted to frustrate these efforts, but their targets have proved too resourceful, too careful—too determined—to be deterred.

The Declaration of Independence was meant to signal the rejection of tyranny and the empowerment of the individual to resist undue coercion. That principle, so essential to the American idea, may soon end the occupation of Minnesota, but not before two brave individuals lost their lives.

In a clear sign of the operation’s failure, Donald Trump has ordered the Border Patrol “commander at large” Gregory Bovino out of the state and back to his prior post, where he is expected to retire soon. Perhaps this is a turning point, a moment that forces the Trump administration to lead more cautiously, less aggressively—and perhaps not. America was born from a collection of ideas about who we are and what we believe, but the practical results are still playing out. These principles will survive only if they persist in the American imagination, and only if Americans remain willing to fight for them. It’s too soon to say whether we can salvage every beautiful thing imagined by America’s Founders from every weakness they bequeathed.</div>

You know what they say about &quot;in matters of taste..&quot;

Sanderson is huge. People know about him and buy his books in droves. I can&#39;t even figure out which Hamilton you are referring to.

I get a few search results for that name and fantasy, but no one that seems to stand out. The top search result I got was a fantasy football news site.

I wish him all the best luck with success here, but this move just might expose the real reasons writers don’t often become screen writers, producers, or directors.

It&#39;s a big risk. Look at what happened with Rowling, turned out to be a horrible person and damaged the HP brand.

On the other hand you can see what happened when they got the Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (who write under the name James SA Corey) to supervise the writers room for The Expanse. They ended up with one of the greatest TV Space-Operas of all time. The Expanse was phenomenal.

However the duo already had TV writing experience beforehand so they knew how to adapt. But the end result was a series that was faithful enough to the books but excellent for the screen. There where changes, characters merged, parts mis

I&#39;ve listened to some of Sanderson&#39;s podcasts and I think he&#39;s been pretty open about how he does not see himself as a screen writer. My impression is that he wants creative control to prevent poor decisions, like e.g. an exec turning allomancy from a system with built-in constraints, to &quot;whatever we think would be a cool thing in this scene.&quot; Or, considering Foundation, using the novels as nothing more than vague inspiration.

Well, having written that I then came across Bradon stating he&#39;ll be writing the screenplay for Mistborn himself. So let&#39;s hope he&#39;s up to the task after all.

The basic claim is correct.    This article is more in depth and it has a graph with the trends.   BEV and Petrol (aka gas) HAVE met.  at 22.5% of  registration  (though Diesel is still 7%  and is separate.  HEV at 33%  and PHEV at 10.7% rounding out their categories.).    Plain ICE,  gas and diesel are def going down.

But if you count HEV as &quot;gas&quot;  well...  HEV+plain-ICE  is 62% vs  BEV at 22.5% so...

Just like all the other articles on here since 2001

The dialect is called British English because it is spoken all over Britain and has been for centuries. The existence of Welsh, Cornish and two Gaelics does not negate this, as the spread of those languages has never really coincided with the national boundaries, particularly in Scotland.

The bigger question is why English is called English.

>&quot;British English&quot;? Is that some kind of cultural genocide, robbing England of its language?&quot;

English is the lingua franca now.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with saying &quot;British English&quot;, it is done all the time to denote the English as used by Britain vs. other countries, which have some significant variations.  Nobody denies that the central development of English came from England.

>&quot;You know that each country in Britain has their own language, and the one from England is called English.&quot;

I know he was being a dick, but there really are meaningful differences between the autonomy of the four home nations of the UK and American states or Canadian provinces. The UK is an old and messy place, and it has four constituent countries / nations within a single state. For the purposes of relations with other nation-states, there’s primarily just the UK, but for day to day governance, it’s quite different.

1. We talk about British English all the time, when talking about English in the UK vs other places2. No-one here, not even the most ardent Scottish, Welsh or Irish nationalist, thinks of their countries as having a single native language. For a start, Scotland has both Scottish Gaelic and Scots, as well as Scottish English. Fewer than 1% of Scots have the Gaelic, and Scots exists on a dialect continuum with English. Basically 100% of people born in all four home countries speak English w

Petroleum is crude oil.As far as words go gasoline came first in the 1860s then petrol in the 1890s.People in all countries make up words. Where do you think words come from?

Gasoline is the older word, and FYI, it originated in London.  It was a product of John Cassell called &quot;Cazeline&quot;. A Dublin shopkeeper named Samuel Boyd got into a trademark dispute with Cassel, so changed the spelling to &quot;Gazeline&quot; as a dodge.  The word &quot;Gasoline&quot; appears as a listed product taxed in the US in the 1860s.    By contrast, the word &quot;Petrol&quot; didn&#39;t come into play until the 1890s, as a product created by Carless, Capel & Leonard. They tried to trademark it, but the trademark failed and it b

The basic claim is correct.    This article is more in depth and it has a graph with the trends.The customers in the EU have made it clear what their preferences are, all things being equal, and things are rarely equal.  ICE (and various HEV variants) will be the right choice for some for a long long time.

Giving the major automakers a challenge is good.   The 70 year up escalator of car prices via unneeded features and unnecessary extra computer chips needs competition.

We are definitely seeing some responses from the OEMs too. Sometimes both wacky and intriguing, like this:https://www.dacia.co.uk/concep... [dacia.co.uk]

Hybrids without plug-in are kind of annoying. They tend to have very small batteries and charge them from dino juice. People are sold on them as convenient, but they aren&#39;t great for my lungs. Better than a pure fossil, but still not great.

At least with a PHEV some more of those miles will be electric, but we are still a long way from decent air quality around here.

... while they are parked at the EV charging stations.

But I fully expect them to end up as a niche brand. I do honestly respect a lot of the groundbreaking work that was done by Tesla, effectively proving that EVs could be mainstream. It took a lot of public money to do it, but maybe it was worth it. Now that job is done its up to someone else to make vehicles for everyone and that was never going to Tesla. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll always have something to offer but they&#39;re not the leaders on FSD and they don&#39;t really make the kind of simple EV that most people are looking for at a price that everyone can afford.

I&#39;m still interested to see if Toyota can make a dent in this market. They&#39;ve been holding back because of the battery limitations but that&#39;s allowed Chinese brands to eat up the market. Eventually the market appeal of the Toyota brand is going to wear off, they can&#39;t expect us to wait forever.

I think some of those items you mentioned, eg, heat pumps for EVs, have been part of the core offer right from the outset. My first gen Zoe back in 2015 had a 400V battery, heat pump, pre-heat, and did 20 to 80 in 40mins. It was, admittedly, a puny battery, but still, it was all of what you described.

I still think there’s a lot of room for innovation and quality. In Europe, in particular, I am convinced that there will be a lot of demand for a supermini with a 300+ mile range. We have a lot of supermi

The formula and main approaches have been identified. Whatever battery improvements happen will just get incorporated as they come.No, it is not. It&#39;s just the current crop of cars, e.g. the 2025 model year. Now you get similar technology that had costed 50,000 EUR or more a few years ago, in 25,000 EUR cars. But if you look into the 50,000 EUR range, it&#39;s different. Take the Xpeng g7+ for example, which offers 20-80% charging in 10 mins at a price point of 53,000 EUR! Or the Mercedes CLA 250+ with a 500 mile range costing 58,000 EUR!

Charging technology is currently switching from 400 V DC to 800 V DC - but that&#39;s not just the cars,

Toyota held back because they put all their chips into hydrogen and failed miserably. Set themselves back a decade.

I think you have to consider the counter-factual: a world without Tesla. I reckon in the end it had only a mildly accelerative effect, if any, because the Chinese were already committed to the transition at the time Tesla started, and they built the stack, top to bottom. They would have been providing the same push to European OEMs that they are providing right now. There was a time when it could have been very different, but that would have required Tesla to go with the Model 2, not waste time on the boond

Their claim of battery limitations is an excuse they used to do nothing, all the while pushing hydrogen which was a disaster.

FTFY. Toyota claimed there were battery limitations even a full decade after EVs were commonly seen on the roads. Their claim of battery limitations is an excuse they used to do nothing, all the while pushing hydrogen which was a disaster. They are so hyper focused on gaslighting countries and claiming that the Hilux and Camry are the only viable car they are very much missing the train when it comes to how the market is moving.

It took a lot of public money to do it...This often gets said, but it&#39;s not true.  They got a $465M DOE loan.  But that was a loan, which they paid back.  Federal tax incentives went to anyone buying any EV from any company.

Too often, these articles have conflated fully electric with all-electric. But not this time: 308,955 full BEVs were sold across Europe* in December 2025 vs 250,449 petrol cars. And it’s the rate of change that’s quite startling: EVs up by more than 100k yoy, and petrol down 55k. If (*if*) we saw the same change next years, we’d be at 400k+ BEV sales and under 200k petrol. That would put BEVs about even with hybrids (381k this year, up less than 20k from last year) and far more than PHEVs (123k this year, up a touch over 30k from last year), assuming their growth rates remain more or less the same. By 2028, on the same trajectories, we’d be above 500k BEVs, under 150k petrol, and it would be blindingly obvious that BEVs were the dominant drivetrain.

For those of us who prefer quieter streets and cleaner air, this is a big, big win — especially when coupled with the other modal shift happening — the rise of microtransportation (cycling, e-bikes including e-cargo and e-trikes/quadricycles, e-scooters).

Of course, there’s a very very long journey ahead. The UK has 34m cars on the road, of which about 2m are now EVs. We buy 2m new cars a year, so even if we were at 100% new EV sales, it would take roughly 16 years for the whole fleet to turn over. And obviously, we’re a way off that. But in 20 years, this transition will be more or less done in Europe, and that’s pretty amazing to think about.

Only the rich early adopter types have money to buy a new car in Europe.

How much have car sales gone down overall?

Peak was 2019, 15.9m. 2025 was 13.3m. The US peaked in 2016 at 17.5m, 2025 was 16.2m. I think the data for both places for both are far too messy to support the PP’s contention that Europeans can somehow not afford to buy new cars (by implication compared with Americans).

Where&#39;s the clickbait headline that reads, &quot;Kernel Cummunity Hatches Plans to Ditch Linux Torvolds&quot;? Did the punch-up guy call in sick?

The kernel team should keep the leadership small since there are many, many people who would use a public position as Linux public face to turn the Linux project into a political platform far away from operating systems and computers.

Typically, those will ask for representation on the board in the name of fairness, then nominate like-minded activists, sit quietly for a few years while continually getting like-minded activists on the board.  When they have a board majority, they turn the organization into a

the activist behaviour you describe is already rampant within open source.

If there is a conclave, they should only be allowed to use paper/pencil and other analog equipment and a computer that has only Microsoft Windows installed and no way to install anything else.

Indeed. This is nothing special, just some smart people planning ahead. Also, Linus (or any other core-team member) may become unavailable long-term for a number of reasons. Smart people plan for that, wayyyyy ahead of it becoming urgent.

His claim for asylum based on Finland forcing him to use Windows is no longer valid. It was shaky at best in the first place.

I don&#39;t see the advantage for the authorities. It seems more complex than doing as they have always, ask Facebook/Twitter-X/... what is the user IP of an offending message, then ask the mobile operator who pays for that IP. For other purposes of age verification, such as purchasing alcohol, the shop knows you by name and address.

This is wisdom. Its funny how adults are supposed to be immune to the sickness these websites cause which clearly they are the ones who are most negatively effected by them.

They get so incredibly pissed when you point it out, too. I remember leaving a comment once that said simply, &quot;Wait until you see what it does to the adults.&quot; that got downmodded immediately. Pretty sure it happened more than once.

I think they confused the moderation feature with a &quot;reaction&quot; button.

Precisely.  Facebook, etc. employ armies of developers and psychologists who are really, really good at hacking people&#39;s brains.  Even smart people are basically defenseless against the resources Facebook can bring to bear to suck you in.  Which is why I cancelled all my social media accounts a while back... at least on &quot;engagement-based&quot; platforms.

You can&#39;t win against them.  The only option is not to play their game.

If you&#39;re going to cut teens off from social media, don&#39;t put important information on social media where they can&#39;t access it.This post obviously wasn&#39;t the only place where the information was published.

Just like that, another country that decides that they would rather not actually deal with the base issues. This protects no one, and I have yet to see an effective age verification tool.

Oh, pray tell. What are the &quot;base issues&quot;, and how should they realistically be addressed?

I can&#39;t answer for that poster.  But much of the &quot;base issues&quot; has to do with not interactively preparing children for what they will be exposed to.  And that is difficult, especially if there are no controls.  It needs to start with restricting access and then gradually giving more exposure as they mature.  Instead, parents are just allowing children to have devices, with little or no controls at all.

Children shouldn&#39;t have unsupervised access to unrestricted, internet-connected devices.  It goes way beyon

The first thing Macron does after this decision is post on X ?!

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

            <h2>Birmingham City Council's Oracle ERP fiasco now £144M and still not working</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/birmingham_oracle_latest/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Birmingham City Council&#39;s SAP-to-Oracle project is set to cost £144.4 million – more than seven times earlier estimates – as it waits for a fully functioning system five years after its planned go-live date.

Keen Reg readers will know the sorry saga of the ERP disaster at Europe&#39;s largest local authority. For the uninitiated, highlights include going live with a system unfit to manage the council&#39;s £3 billion in taxpayer revenue and multibillion-pound spending budget; a decision to turn off audits for fraud detection for more than 18 months; allocating £2 billion in transactions to the wrong year; and multiple delays and overspending.

Pertaining to the last item on this list of shame, Birmingham City Council has released new figures. In a written response published with its council meeting this week, officials said the total forecast cost of the program up to the 2027/28 financial year is £144.4 million, up from an initial estimate of £19 million with a £1 million contingency. In 2024, the total budget approved across financial years 2018/19 to 2025/26 was £131 million.

The project began in 2018, when the council planned to move away from its legacy R/3 SAP system to more modern software. Having picked Oracle Fusion, it initially planned to go live in December 2020 for finance and procurement, and in February 2021 for HR and payroll. According to a 2021 business case, this was replanned with a revised launch in April 2022 for both functions.

Having hit the project milestone, things went from bad to worse. Although the council had planned to implement Oracle &quot;out-of-the-box,&quot; it created several customizations including a banking reconciliation system that failed to function properly. The council struggled to understand its cash position and was unable to produce auditable accounts. It has spent more than £5 million on manual workaround labor.

The Oracle implementation – along with poor management of equal pay cases – led to the council becoming effectively bankrupt in 2023.

The council has now bought a third-party solution to cover the banking reconciliation function, and is reimplementing Oracle from scratch, a project that was due to go live in April, and has now been delayed by several months.

The mushrooming cost of the project also needs to take into account the fact that schools have been removed from its scope, a move that might have led to reduced costs.

Nor does ballooning spending reflect how much the authority might be out of pocket in total. The initial project had banked expected savings in the millions from the 2022 go-live date. Anticipated savings of £69 million in 2023/24 were written off. In 2024, investigators put the total money lost at £216.5 million, which might climb by £10 million or so, given the new cost projection.

At around £225 million, the money lost equates to about £200 per person within the council&#39;s boundaries. ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion It&#39;s not your fault Amazon hired you for a position that it no longer deems necessary - blame bad planning or unanticipated market conditions. Everybody guesses wrong sometimes, even with the power of the most sophisticated business analysis software and the smartest prognosticators one can hire.

It&#39;s not your fault if you quit your last job because you believed the promises of your new employer. Maybe they offered you more money, more freedom, more challenging and interesting work. Whatever they offered, getting laid off trumps all that. &quot;Is a dream a lie if it don&#39;t come true, or is it something worse?&quot; Bruce Springsteen once asked in a song. I&#39;m still not sure exactly what he meant.

It&#39;s not your fault if you turned down offers from other employers because you valued the stability of your current workplace, or you liked your bosses and colleagues (a good hang is worth a lot, as one former journalist colleague put it), or thought you were serving a more valuable mission than the one your would-have-been new employer offered. It&#39;s not your fault. You made what seemed like the best decision you could&#39;ve made at the time, given the information you had.

It&#39;s hard not to blame yourself. Other people will blame you. Some people you thought were friends will use the moment to take their digs, bring you down a notch, criticize you for being too blind to see the signs. Your family might resent you for no longer being able to support them in the manner to which they were accustomed. If you&#39;re taking care of sick relatives, you&#39;ll all suffer under the sudden scramble to secure health insurance. But it&#39;s not your fault.

Others will be indifferent. The colleagues you left behind, having felt the scythe blade pass inches from their neck, may feel good reason to draw into their shells completely. People who&#39;ve been through it before may shrug and welcome you to the club.

On the flip side, some people will surprise you with their offers of introductions, brainstorming sessions, moral and maybe even financial support. Thank those people profusely, and try to pay it forward the next time somebody you know goes through it. Few bucks are better spent than on the beers you buy for a friend who&#39;s suddenly knee-deep in the shit.

I know how this goes. I&#39;ve worked in journalism for most of my career. My profession has shrunk dramatically over the last 20 years as the internet ate all the old revenue models. Craigslist decimated classified ads, Google and Facebook destroyed most of the rest of print advertising, then steadily chipped away at digital news business models, redirecting their massive audiences to whatever made them the most money. Switch to video, the pundits said. Go indie. Learn to code.

Now a lot of those coding jobs are disappearing too, sacrificed on the altar of AI and ever-increasing efficiency. If you believe the most foaming-mouthed AI prognosticators, the Dario Amodeis and Sam Altmans of the world, you can expect that this scene will be repeated many times in coming years, across many professions.

It won&#39;t be easy, but technological upheavals have happened before, and the skills you&#39;ve acquired may find surprising new uses in the AI world. You are not your job. You&#39;ll find a new fit.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government will work with supplier Anthropic to build an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant for job seekers, despite its chief executive’s doom-laden views of the job market.

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said that Anthropic will help the government to build and pilot an assistant that will help support people in specific situations, starting with “providing custom career advice and help to lock down a job”.

The pilot is planned to start later this year.

Earlier in the week Anthropic’s chief executive Dario Amodei published a magnum opus detailing among other things how he expects AI to disrupt to the job market.

“The short-term transition will be unusually painful compared to past technologies, since humans and labour markets are slow to react and to equilibrate,” he wrote of the speed of AI development.

The breadth of tasks AI will do “will make it harder for people to switch easily from jobs that are displaced to similar jobs that they would be a good fit for,” said said. “In the end AI will be able to do everything, and we need to grapple with that.”

The job seeker pilot is one of several announcements from the government as part of what DSIT called “a week of focused action” on AI. This includes commissioning a group of Brit AI experts to develop open source tools to support public services with Meta providing $1 million (£730,000) of funding for a fellowship programme run by the Alan Turing Institute.

The projects will include AI analysis of video and images of transport infrastructure to help local authorities prioritize repair work and AI services that can run offline or within secure networks to help protect sensitive data.

DSIT also announced it was opening access to a set of online AI training courses through an AI Skills Hub, with the aim of providing 10 million workers with skills in the technology. The hub can be accessed by setting up an online account and includes free courses by universities as well as the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s Hartree Centre.

However two-thirds of the 36 free general beginners’ courses lasting an hour are provided by technology vendors with 11 from Amazon, eight from Microsoft and seven from Google.

One review of Microsoft’s Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot described it as more an advertorial for Copilot than a training course.

The Department for Education said it is working to set up AI-powered tutoring tools to provide children with one-to-one learning support, co-designed by teachers, which will be available to schools by the end of 2027. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Lidl is a well-known purveyor of inexpensive groceries, random goods via the Middle of Lidl, and now… bork.

Spotted by an eagle-eyed Register reader, this branch of Lidl has a bit of bargain basement digital signage, judging by what is on the screen of the non-booting wallware.

The boot agent has a copyright datestamp of 2013; a challenging time for the chipmaker – Intel – but nothing compared to today&#39;s woes. Back then, the company was pushing its 4th-generation chips while belatedly realizing that tablets and smartphones, not desktop PCs, were the consumer future..

Digital signage not booting on wall of Lidl - Click to enlarge

2013 also marked the beginning of Brian Krzanich&#39;s tenure as CEO. Krzanich quit five years later, after some consensual hard rebooting with an Intel employee came to light - the sort of thing companies frown upon, though it pales beside the company&#39;s subsequent strategic missteps under later executives.

It&#39;s fitting, then, to see this Intel era commemorated by Lidl with digital signage that won&#39;t boot. Something has clearly befallen whatever disk lurks behind the scenes. The message &quot;An operating system wasn&#39;t found&quot; isn&#39;t promising. And there&#39;s no keyboard for the recommended three-finger salute (Ctrl+Alt+Del) the stricken sign suggests.

Beyond its occasionally odd-sounding brand names, Lidl is famous for its &#39;Middle of Lidl&#39; aisle (not to be confused with Aldi&#39;s Aisle of Dreams). The aisle contains whatever oddball items the company&#39;s buyers thought were a good idea at the time. It&#39;s hard not to imagine a time-expired digital sign appearing there, nestled among vacuum cleaners and pedal bins.

We&#39;ve hidden some of the network information that might be of use to passing miscreants. After all, it would take mere moments to display something the retail giant would prefer not to see on its walls.

&quot;Time for the checkout clerk to call tech support I guess,&quot; mused our reader, &quot;unless they know how to disconnect any drive that doesn&#39;t have an OS installed.&quot;

            <h2>Microsoft investors sweat cloud giant's OpenAI exposure</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What should have been a banner second quarter for Microsoft was met with tepid apprehension on Wall Street on Wednesday, sending its share price down by 6 percent in after-hours trading.

It could have been a celebratory quarter, as Redmond saw profits surge 60 percent year over over (YoY) to $38.5 billion on revenues of $81.3 billion. But in question after question, analysts politely pressed CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood for assurances that Microsoft&#39;s lopsided reliance on AI model makers – and the massive capital expenditures required to serve them – wasn&#39;t going to come back to haunt the cloud giant.

Of particular concern was the fact that 45 percent of Microsoft&#39;s $625 billion backlog was directly attributable to OpenAI.

As part of OpenAI&#39;s restructuring as a public benefit corporation last fall, Microsoft revealed OpenAI had contracted to purchase an incremental $250 billion in Azure services. In exchange, Redmond would give up the right of first refusal to be OpenAI&#39;s compute provider.

Hood attempted to assuage investors that the other 55 percent of Microsoft&#39;s remaining performance obligations were broad-based and growing at a healthy pace, up 28 percent during the quarter.

&quot;The reason we talked about that number is because 55% or roughly $350 billion is related to the breadth of our portfolio, the breadth of customers, across solutions, across Azure, across industries, across geographies,&quot; she said. &quot;That is a significant RPO balance, larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers. And frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it.&quot;

Left out of Hood&#39;s analyst commentary, but conspicuously noted in Microsoft&#39;s earnings slides, was the fair portion of that growth driven by OpenAI rival Anthropic.

As you may recall, back in November, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft with an additional commitment to support the deployment of up to a gigawatt of compute capacity. But the deal didn&#39;t come cheap. In exchange, Nvidia and Microsoft agreed to invest half that ($10 billion and $5 billion) respectively back into the AI model dev.

In other words, roughly half of Redmond&#39;s backlog is tied up in AI startups that haven&#39;t yet shown they can turn a profit.

To realize those revenues, Microsoft will have to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, and it won&#39;t all be its in-house silicon, like the Maia 200 revealed this week. That gigawatt of compute capacity we mentioned earlier is tied specifically to deployments of Nvidia Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.

Speaking with analysts on Wednesday, Hood attempted to dispel Wall Street&#39;s jitters over Microsoft&#39;s rampant capex spending, which topped $37.5 billion during the quarter. Of that, two-thirds is wrapped up in fast depreciating assets like GPUs and CPUs, which have just six years to generate a profit.

&quot;I think it&#39;s probably better to think about the Azure guidance that we give as an allocated capacity guide about what we can deliver in Azure revenue,&quot; she said.

&quot;The majority of the capital that we&#39;re spending today and a lot of the GPUs that we&#39;re buying are already contracted for most of their useful life.&quot; she added when pressed on Microsoft&#39;s ability to achieve a meaningful return on investment the chips aged out. &quot;Much of that risk that I think you&#39;re pointing to isn&#39;t there because they&#39;re already sold for the entirety of their useful life.&quot;

But as any landlord knows, just because someone signs a lease doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re good for the rent when the going gets tough.

Looking ahead to Q3, Microsoft expects to continue riding the AI wave. The company is forecasting revenues of $80.65 to $81.75 billion, up 15 to 17 percent year-over-year.

At the same time, Microsoft doesn&#39;t expect to spend quite so lavishly during the third quarter, with capex down compared to Q2, due to &quot;normal variability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases,&quot; Hood explained. ®

            <h2>Google to foist Gemini pane on Chrome users in automated browsing push</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has reworked its Chrome browser to include a new side panel for interacting with the company&#39;s Gemini model, in an effort to support AI-assisted interactions with websites.

Toward that end, Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers have gained the option of delegating browsing tasks to Gemini as a software agent.

Chrome – the world&#39;s most popular browser by far with more than 70 percent market share as per StatCounter – thus follows in the path of Microsoft Edge, Perplexity, OpenAI Atlas, and Opera, among others, in the belief that internet users want to sit back while AI does the browsing and (perhaps) buying.

The Gemini button, introduced last September on the top right-hand corner of Chrome, has been adjusted to shrink the display area of websites in order to accommodate a sidebar pane to chat with the Google AI bot.

&quot;This can help you save time and multitask without interruption,&quot; explained Parisa Tabriz, VP of Chrome, in a blog post. &quot;You can keep your primary work open on one tab while using the side panel to handle a different task.&quot;

Tabriz suggests this has organizational benefits by allowing users to compare options presented in different tabs or to summarize product reviews across different websites.

As shown in the blog post, if you had an image loaded in your browser from a website that depicted a photo booth, you could tell Gemini to &quot;Go to Etsy and find supplies to recreate the photo booth and add them to my cart. Don&#39;t spend more than $75 total.&quot; The AI agent would then attempt a series of steps that involve navigating to Etsy, finding objects depicted in the photo like fringe curtains, adding them to your shopping cart, all the way up to the point where you would have the option to purchase the materials.

The side panel has also been integrated with Google Nano Banana, for creating images directly or for altering images in the browser window.

Google has also deepened Chrome&#39;s integration with Connected Apps, which now include Google Workspace apps, various calendar and communications apps for Android, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Google Photos, Home, Maps, Shopping and Flights. These applications are potentially accessible to Gemini with the appropriate permissions.

The Chocolate Factory says it plans to bring Gemini&#39;s Personal Intelligence to Chrome in the coming months, so that its AI-browser mélange can retain past interactions with websites and applications to inform its present context, if you opt in.

With these various revisions, Tabriz claims Chrome can act as a software agent, capable of executing tasks that involve a series of steps, with a capability dubbed &quot;Chrome auto browse.&quot;

&quot;Auto browse can help you optimize your vacation planning by doing some of the mundane work, like researching hotel and flight costs across multiple date options, so you can find a budget-friendly time to travel,&quot; Tabriz explains.

She suggests the software can schedule appointments, fill out forms, assemble tax documents, solicit bids from tradespeople, and so on.

The tweaks apply to Chrome for macOS, Windows and Chromebook Plus in the US presently. As for auto browse, it is presently limited to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers.

But the utility of Chrome auto browse may yet be less than Google hopes, thanks to barriers some websites are putting in place to limit agentic interaction. Amazon recently sued Perplexity, alleging it initiated automated site access without proper authorization, and eBay has revised its user agreement to disallow orders placed without human review.

Websites aren&#39;t necessarily willing participants in the effort to exile human interaction. Whether they can detect automated visits is another matter. And the willingness of websites to keep bots at bay may waver if there&#39;s cash being left on the table: McKinsey projects that by 2030, agentic commerce for business-to-consumer retail operations could reach $1 trillion in the US.

Google for its part appears to be trying to resolve this tension. Its Chrome auto browse will ask for human confirmation when making purchases or posting to social media sites. And the company says Chrome will support Google&#39;s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), an open standard for bot-driven commerce developed with the help of Etsy, Shopify, Target, and Wayfair. ®

﻿Background audio was being exposed during missed calls ‘under very specific and rare circumstances.’

Google is disabling some Phone app features on older Pixel devices after acknowledging a bug that inadvertently leaked audio to callers. The issue has specifically been linked to the Take a Message feature released last year, which automatically answers and transcribes voicemails when you miss a call, with a handful of Pixel 4 and 5 owners reporting that their microphones were activating when callers were leaving messages.

“We’ve investigated this issue, which we’ve confirmed affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances,” said Google community manager Siri Tejaswini on a support page. “Out of an abundance of caution, we’re disabling Take a Message and next-gen Call Screen features from these devices.”

One Reddit user who experienced the bug said that callers did not hear their usual voicemail greeting, and that they “could hear me/room sounds while they were leaving a message.” The user describes how the microphone privacy indicator at the top-right corner of their phone display was triggered after missing a call and Take a Message activated. “It was as though I picked up the phone, except I had done nothing. It just passively started recording me and sending audio to the caller.”

We have asked Google if these features are being permanently removed from Pixel 4 and 5 handsets, or if they will be restored in the future. For now, Tejaswini says that impacted Pixel owners “will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening or their carrier voicemail instead.”

He’ll be working on his ‘favorite products’ at the company.

Sebastiaan de With, known for his work on apps like Halide, Kino, and Orion as the co-founder of Lux, is joining Apple’s design team, he announced today. “So excited to work with the very best team in the world on my favorite products,” de With says in his post.

de With is well-known for his deep dives on Apple’s iPhone cameras — I was a big fan of his post about the iPhone 16E’s camera (which he called a “vibe”), and on the other end of the spectrum, his iPhone 17 Pro camera review is a fascinating read, too. Lux’s apps also have strong points of view, like the Process Zero mode in the iPhone camera app Halide and the pro-level features available in the Kino video capture app.

Lux’s other co-founder, Ben Sandofsky, posted this statement on Reddit:

I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of Lux and Halide. Today we launched the public preview of Halide Mark III, and the reception is more positive than we possibly could have hoped.

As we mentioned in the announcement post today, we’ve been working with legendary team at The Iconfactory on Mark III. We’re also super excited to be collaborating with the renowned colorist Cullen Kelly on the new looks in Mark III.

Ten years ago I started Halide, and for ten years, I lead product, ran the business, and coded almost everything. Except for the paywall. I hate working on payment screens. But I built everything else, and design was always a collaborative experience.

So in short, Halide is going nowhere. This has been my full time job since 2019, and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.

de With and Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

de With has worked with Apple in the past; on his website, he says that he has done “design work for various companies like Apple, where I worked on iCloud / MobileMe and the Find My apps.”

Update, January 28th: Added statement from Sandofsky.

Who has time for the metaverse when you can try AI-generated inspo content instead?

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse dreams seem to have been replaced by a new vision: an AI-generated social feed. In an earnings call on Wednesday, Zuckerberg reiterated his belief that AI will become the next big media format, making feeds “more immersive and interactive:”

We started with text, and then moved to photos when we got phones with cameras, and then moved to video when mobile networks got fast enough. Soon, we’ll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive, and only possible because of advances in AI.

Zuckerberg added that apps currently “feel like algorithms that recommend content.” But that’s going to change, according to Zuckerberg, as Meta’s apps will eventually greet users with AI that “understands” them, can serve up content they like, and “generate great personalized content.”

Last year, Zuckerberg similarly brought up an AI-infused social media, saying that Meta would “add yet another huge corpus of content” to its recommendation system as AI makes content “easier to create and remix.” Meta has already realized part of this plan, as it launched a new “Vibes” feed in the Meta AI app that lets you scroll through a feed of short, AI-generated videos.

During the call, Zuckerberg also hinted at a new format that will allow users to create a world or game using a prompt and then share it with friends, adding that videos could become interactive as well. “There’s definitely a version of the future where any video that you see, you can tap on and jump into it and… experience it in a more meaningful way,” Zuckerberg said.

As the call progressed, Zuckerberg didn’t bring up goals for the metaverse, instead saying that the company’s investments in virtual reality (VR) and Horizon Worlds will “pair well with these AI advances,” helping to bring these experiences to people “through mobile.” Meta’s Reality Labs, which includes a metaverse division, reported a $6.02 billion operating loss during the last three months of 2025. Earlier this month, Meta laid off at least 1,000 employees in the division, while shutting down three of its VR studios.

Meta reported revenue of $59.9 billion during the final quarter of 2025 and a net income of $22.8 billion. It seems the company plans to open up more streams of revenue by monetizing its Meta AI chatbot, too, as Zuckerberg told investors that there will be opportunities for “subscriptions and advertising” with Meta AI, lining up with TechCrunch’s report that the company plans on putting premium AI features behind a paywall.

Windows 11 hit the milestone in the recent holiday quarter.

Windows 11 now has one billion users. Microsoft hit the milestone during the recent holiday quarter, meaning Windows 11 has managed to reach one billion users faster than Windows 10 did nearly six years ago.

“Windows reached a big milestone, 1 billion Windows 11 users,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the company’s fiscal Q2, 2026 earnings call. “Up over 45 percent year-over-year.” The growth of Windows 11 over the past quarter will be related to Microsoft’s end of support for Windows 10, which also helped increase Microsoft’s Windows OEM revenues.

Microsoft must have had a strong number of Windows 11 users throughout December, as Windows chief Pavan Davuluri revealed at Microsoft Ignite on November 19th that “nearly a billion people” were running Windows 11.

What’s interesting is that Windows 11 has managed to reach one billion users in 1,576 days, less than the 1,706 days it took Windows 10 to reach the same milestone. Microsoft had planned to get Windows 10 running on a billion devices within three years of its release, but the timeline got extended after the cancelation of Windows Phone.

Production of the two pioneering models will end in the second quarter of 2026, Elon Musk says.

Tesla will discontinue the Model S and Model X in the second quarter of 2026, Elon Musk said in an earnings call with investors today. No advance word was given about the cancellations, making it an abrupt ending for Tesla’s two original flagship EVs.

Musk said the reasons for cancelling the vehicle programs was to make room at Tesla’s Fremont factory for production of its Optimus humanoid robot. It was the starkest example yet of Musk’s quest to transform Tesla from an automaker into an AI and robotics leader.

“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we’re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,” he said. “So if you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.”

The Model S is Tesla’s luxury sedan, first released in 2012, while the Model X was its SUV with gull-wing doors, introduced in 2015. Sales of both vehicles has been declining steadily, as the company shifted focus to its mass-market Model 3 and Model Y.

In 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 “other models,” a category that includes Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. That represented a 40.2 percent decrease in sales, year over year.

Musk has been attempting to transform Tesla from an automotive company to one that makes self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The transition has been rocky, with Tesla reporting a 61 percent decrease in profits in the fourth quarter.

Whether you want a battery that lasts for days or just the best deal, we’ve got some recs for your next iPhone.

If you’ve been holding off on getting a new iPhone, now’s the perfect time to size up your options. Apple’s 2025 iPhone lineup is now widely available, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens. Apple Intelligence, however, remains a work in progress.

Alongside the new hardware, Apple also launched iOS 26 (yes, the numbering system has changed), which includes a new Liquid Glass user interface, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s biggest visual redesign since iOS 7, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it looks fine.

If your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage at 256GB. And that’s all for the same price as last year’s model, despite the ongoing tariff situation in the US.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for at least a full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model.

Battery performance can vary significantly across iPhone models, primarily due to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that.

One size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.

While the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been upgraded from a 12-megapixel to a 48-megapixel sensor, which delivers sharper, more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).

Apple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance. The biggest differences are that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.

Whereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is geared more toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.

Despite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the new “it” color.

Screen: 6.9-inch 2868 x 1320 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.

There are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display of any phone in Apple’s current iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media. If you want the most iPhone you can possibly get, including the longest battery life, then the 17 Pro Max is the way to go.

The iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, coming in at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s more durable than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small despite its 6.5-inch display, though you really have to see and feel it yourself to understand the appeal.

But the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to other models. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is bad. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.

At $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving regarding the shortcomings.

This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing.

There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it’s basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.

The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn out to be useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.

            <h2>How the grid can ride out winter storms</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <h2>Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year

Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.Although Google shuttered its high-profile internet balloon project Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <h2>Synthesia’s valuation jumps to $4B after $200M raise</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.
