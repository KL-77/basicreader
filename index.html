            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like most tools, generative AI models can be misused. And when the misuse gets bad enough that a major dictionary notices, you know it’s become a cultural phenomenon.

On Sunday, Merriam-Webster announced that “slop” is its 2025 Word of the Year, reflecting how the term has become shorthand for the flood of low-quality AI-generated content that has spread across social media, search results, and the web at large. The dictionary defines slop as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster president Greg Barlow told the Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”

To select its Word of the Year, Merriam-Webster’s editors review data on which words rose in search volume and usage, then reach consensus on which term best captures the year. Barlow told the AP that the spike in searches for “slop” reflects growing awareness among users that they are encountering fake or shoddy content online.

Dictionaries have been tracking AI’s impact on language for the past few years, with Cambridge having selected “hallucinate” as its 2023 word of the year due to the tendency of AI models to generate plausible-but-false information (long-time Ars readers will be happy to hear there’s another word term for that in the dictionary as well).

The trend extends to online culture in general, which is ripe with new coinages. This year, Oxford University Press chose “rage bait,” referring to content designed to provoke anger for engagement. Cambridge Dictionary selected “parasocial,” describing one-sided relationships between fans and celebrities or influencers.

As the AP points out, the word “slop” originally entered English in the 1700s to mean soft mud. By the 1800s, it had evolved to describe food waste fed to pigs, and eventually came to mean rubbish or products of little value. The new AI-related definition builds on that history of describing something unwanted and unpleasant.

Although he didn’t coin the term “AI slop,” independent AI researcher Simon Willison helped document its rise in May 2024 when he wrote on his blog comparing it to how “spam” had previously become the word for unwanted email. Quoting a tweet from an X user named @deepfates, Willison showed that the “AI slop” term began circulating in online communities shortly before he wrote his post advocating for its use.

The “slop” term carries a dismissive tone that sets it clearly apart from prominent corporate hype language about the promises and even existential perils of AI. “In 2025, amid all the talk about AI threats, slop set a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking,” Merriam-Webster wrote in a blog post. “The word sends a little message to AI: when it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes you don’t seem too superintelligent.”

In its blog post announcing the word of the year selection, Merriam-Webster noted that 2025 saw a flood of AI-generated videos, off-kilter advertising images, propaganda, fake news, AI-written books, and what it called “workslop,” referring to reports that waste coworkers’ time. Ars Technica has covered similar phenomena invading various fields, including using the term “hiring slop” to describe an overflow of AI-generated résumés in June.

While some AI critics relish dismissing all generated output as “slop,” there’s some subjective nuance about what earns the label. As former Evernote CEO Phil Libin told Axios in April, the distinction may come down to intention: “When AI is used to produce mediocre things with less effort than it would have taken without AI, it’s slop. When it’s used to make something better than it could have been made without AI, it’s a positive augmentation.”

Willison had his own nuanced take, since he’s a proponent of using AI responsibly as tools to help with tasks like programming, but not with spamming. “Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop,” he wrote in May 2024 when discussing the term. “But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask for it, slop is the perfect term for it.”</div>

            <h2>Stranger Things S5 trailer teases Vol. 2</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re 10 days away from the next installment of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, and Netflix has released a new trailer for what it’s calling Volume 2. This will cover episodes five through seven, with the final episode comprising Vol. 3.

Season 4 ended with Vecna—the Big Bad behind it all—opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We got a time jump for S5, Vol. 1, but in a way, we came full circle, since those events coincided with the third anniversary of Will’s original disappearance in S1.

In Vol. 1, we found Hawkins under military occupation and Vecna targeting a new group of young children in his human form under the pseudonym “Mr. Whatsit” (a nod to A Wrinkle in Time). He kidnapped Holly Wheeler and took her to the Upside Down, where she found an ally in Max, still in a coma, but her consciousness is hiding in one of Vecna’s old memories. Dustin was struggling to process his grief over losing Eddie Munson in S4, causing a rift with Steve. The rest of the gang was devoted to stockpiling supplies and helping Eleven and Hopper track down Vecna in the Upside Down. They found  Kali/Eight, Eleven’s psychic “sister” instead, being held captive in a military laboratory.

Things came to a head at the military base when Vecna’s demagorgons attacked to take 11 more children, wiping out most of the soldiers in record time. The big reveal was that, as a result of being kidnapped by Vecna in S1, Will has his own supernatural powers. He can tap into Vecna’s hive mind and manipulate those powers for his own purposes. He used his newfound powers to save his friends from the demagorgons.

This new trailer picks up right where Vol. 1 left off, with Will surveying the devastation and declaring, “We failed. We never stood a chance.” Joyce assures him all is not yet lost. But our intrepid crew clearly still has a fair amount of tribulation ahead. One tantalizing moment has Dustin declaring that they were all “dead wrong” about what the Upside Down actually is. The Duffer brothers have promised that the final season will answer that question once and for all. We see Kali helping Eleven and Hopper, but it’s unclear whether she will ultimately be friend or foe. Certainly, the team needs all the help they can get.

While we have lost wonderful supporting characters over the previous four seasons, thus far, the main cast has been largely protected. Now all bets are off. Perhaps that’s why fans have reacted so forcefully to a moment in the new trailer between Steve and Dustin, now reconciled, where they tell each other, “If you die, I die.” It’s a callback to S2 when Dustin refused to abandon Steve. But there are fan theories that Steve is on the chopping block as a potential casualty in the final showdown. That would be so cruel to Dustin, who already lost Eddie. Would the Duffers dare take out both characters? I think not, but we shall see.

Volume 2 of the fifth and final season of Stranger Things arrives to Netflix on December 25, 2025. The series finale will be available on December 31, 2025. Netflix is organizing numerous fan events at select theaters for the finale in case you’re keen to see it on a big screen.</div>

            <h2>Microsoft will finally kill obsolete cipher that has wreaked decades of havoc</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is killing off an obsolete and vulnerable encryption cipher that Windows has supported by default for 26 years following more than a decade of devastating hacks that exploited it and recently faced blistering criticism from a prominent US senator.

When the software maker rolled out Active Directory in 2000, it made RC4 a sole means of securing the Windows component, which administrators use to configure and provision fellow administrator and user accounts inside large organizations. RC4, short for Rivist Cipher 4, is a nod to mathematician and cryptographer Ron Rivest of RSA Security, who developed the stream cipher in 1987. Within days of the trade-secret-protected algorithm being leaked in 1994, a researcher demonstrated a cryptographic attack that significantly weakened the security it had been believed to provide. Despite the known susceptibility, RC4 remained a staple in encryption protocols, including SSL and its successor TLS, until about a decade ago.

One of the most visible holdouts in supporting RC4 has been Microsoft. Eventually, Microsoft upgraded Active Directory to support the much more secure AES encryption standard. But by default, Windows servers have continued to respond to RC4-based authentication requests and return an RC4-based response. The RC4 fallback has been a favorite weakness hackers have exploited to compromise enterprise networks. Use of RC4 played a key role in last year’s breach of health giant Ascension. The breach caused life-threatening disruptions at 140 hospitals and put the medical records of 5.6 million patients into the hands of the attackers. US Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in September called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for “gross cybersecurity negligence,” citing the continued default support for RC4.

Last week, Microsoft said it was finally deprecating RC4 and cited its susceptibility to Kerberoasting, the form of attack, known since 2014, that was the root cause of the initial intrusion into Ascension’s network.

“By mid-2026, we will be updating domain controller defaults for the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) on Windows Server 2008 and later to only allow AES-SHA1 encryption,” Matthew Palko, a Microsoft principal program manager, wrote. “RC4 will be disabled by default and only used if a domain administrator explicitly configures an account or the KDC to use it.”

AES-SHA1, an algorithm widely believed to be secure, has been available in all supported Windows versions since the roll out of Windows Server 2008. Since then, Windows clients by default authenticated using the much more secure standard, and servers responded using the same. But, Windows servers, also by default, respond to RC4-based authentication requests and returned an RC4-based response, leaving networks open to Kerberoasting.

Following next year’s change, RC4 authentication will no longer function unless administrators perform the extra work to allow it. In the meantime, Palko said, it’s crucial that admins identify any systems inside their networks that rely on the cipher. Despite the known vulnerabilities, RC4 remains the sole means of some third-party legacy systems for authenticating to Windows networks. These systems can often go overlooked in networks even though they are required for crucial functions.

To streamline the identification of such systems, Microsoft is making several tools available. One is an update to KDC logs that will track both requests and responses that systems make using RC4 when performing requests through Kerberos. Kerberos is an industry-wide authentication protocol for verifying the identities of users and services over a non-secure network. It’s the sole means for mutual authentication to Active Directory, which hackers attacking Windows networks widely consider a Holy Grail because of the control they gain once it has been compromised.

Microsoft is also introducing new PowerShell scripts to sift through security event logs to more easily pinpoint problematic RC4 usage.

Microsoft said it has steadily worked over the past decade to deprecate RC4, but that the task wasn’t easy.

“The problem though is that it’s hard to kill off a cryptographic algorithm that is present in every OS that’s shipped for the last 25 years and was the default algorithm for so long, Steve Syfuhs, who runs Microsoft’s Windows Authentication team, wrote on Bluesky. “See,” he continued, “the problem is not that the algorithm exists. The problem is how the algorithm is chosen, and the rules governing that spanned 20 years of code changes.”

Over those two decades, developers discovered a raft of critical RC4 vulnerabilities that required “surgical” fixes. Microsoft considered deprecating RC4 by this year, but ultimately “punted” after discovering vulnerabilities that required still more fixes. During that time Microsoft introduced some “minor improvements” that favored the use of AES, and as a result, usage dropped by “orders of magnitude.”

“Within a year we had observed RC4 usage drop to basically nil. This is not a bad thing and in fact gave us a lot more flexibility to kill it outright because we knew it genuinely wasn’t going to break folks, because folks weren’t using it.”

Syfuhs went on to document additional challenges Microsoft encountered and the approach it took to solving them.

While RC4 has known cipher weaknesses that make it insecure, Kerberoasting exploits a separate weakness. As implemented in Active Directory authentication, it uses no cryptographic salt and a single round of the MD4 hashing function. Salt is a technique that adds random input to each password before it is hashed. That requires hackers to invest considerable time and resources into cracking the hash. MD4, meanwhile, is a fast algorithm that requires modest resources. Microsoft’s implementation of AES-SHA1 is much slower and iterates the hash to further slow down cracking efforts. Taken together, AES-Sha1-hashed passwords require about 1,000 times the time and resources to be cracked.

Windows admins would do well to audit their networks for any usage of RC4. Given its wide adoption and continued use industry-wide, it may still be active, much to the surprise and chagrin of those charged with defending against hackers.</div>

            <h2>Amazon Deletes AI-Generated Recap of “Fallout” Season 1 After It’s Called Out for Being Full of Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Amazon revealed a new feature that aims to use AI to recap its Prime Video shows.

The tool, now deployed in beta form, generates everything from narration, dialogue, and music to summarize key plot points, allowing fans to quickly catch up on their favorite shows.

At least, that was the idea. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the AI tool has already made an enormous mess by bungling up the details of a hit show, suffering from the common shortcomings of the tech we’ve become all too familiar with.

As GamesRadar reports, the recap of Season 1 for the company’s popular series “Fallout” show was riddled with errors before being taken down by Amazon last week. For instance, the recap assumed that flashbacks from the perspective of the character Cooper Howard — also known as the Ghoul, played by actor Walton Goggins — were set in the 1950s, even though the show and the flashbacks are set in 2077 and the 2060s, respectively.

The AI also claimed that the Ghoul offered actor Ella Purnell’s Lucy MacLean a “die or leave with him” offer in an attempt to hunt down her father, even though they share the same motives and intentionally joined forces to pursue him, as Gizmodo points out.

Put simply, the AI bungled up the absolute basics by completely misrepresenting the motivations of the show’s core ensemble.

The incident once again highlights how AI slop is infiltrating almost every aspect of our daily lives. Even the task of recapping “Fallout” — which is returning for its second season this week and was painstakingly crafted by a passionate crew in honor of the eponymous video game series that it’s based on — isn’t safe.

The news comes after Amazon quietly pulled AI-generated English dubs for several anime shows, including “Banana Fish,” and “No Game, No Life” earlier this month. Fans were furious after finding the soulless dubs to be “hilariously bad.”

Not only were the dubs severely lacking, but many netizens also accused Amazon of cutting corners by blindly replacing human voice actors with dubious AI.

“Amazon’s choice to use AI to dub Banana Fish is a massive insult to us as performers,” famed anime voice actor Daman Mills tweeted at the time. “AI continues to threaten the livelihoods of performers in EVERY language (yes even Japanese performers who are also incredibly vocal on this topic).”

The company’s latest attempts to lazily recap its own shows haven’t fared much better. As The Verge reported last week, Amazon has since taken down a number of different recaps, including the ones for “Fallout” and other Amazon Prime series such as “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and “Upload.”

The feature, dubbed Video Recaps, launched last month as part of an early beta. It purportedly “analyzes a season’s key plot points and character arcs to deeply understand the most pivotal moments that will resonate with viewers,” according to an official press release.

“Then, the AI finds the most compelling video clips and pairs them with audio effects, dialogue snippets, and music,” the company claims. “These are all stitched together with an overarching AI-generated voiceover narration to deliver a theatrical-quality visual recap.”

But given the resulting mess, Amazon still has a lot to prove to justify the existence of its sloppy recapping tool.

“All it would have taken is one person to watch it from start to finish to realize it wasn’t correct,” one Reddit user argued. “Just one person who knows the story of the first season. They didn’t even need to know the lore of the games.”

“Just the first season,” they added. “But they can’t even do that.”

            <div id="article-text">SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket ushered in a new era, offering a fully reusable launch platform that brought outer space closer than ever by dramatically lowering the costs of sending payloads — and eventually astronauts — into orbit.

Now Elon Musk’s space corporation has even more to prove when it comes to its Starship, a gargantuan super heavy lift rocket and booster duo that’s still deep in the development phase. Following over a dozen major explosions, the rocket has yet to safely launch and return to the ground in one piece.

That hasn’t dissuaded a growing number of Chinese companies from unabashedly ripping off the concept, as Ars Technica reports. Most recently, state-operated news outlet China.com detailed acompany called “Beijing Leading Rocket Technology” that named its latest vehicle concept Xingzhou-1 — which translates to “Starship-1” or “Starvessel-1.” A render of the rocket closely resembles SpaceX’s design as well, from the overall proportions down to the grid fins designed to guide the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft back down to the ground.

“Very early stage, only conceptual claims, very ambitiously aiming for 2027 debut fight,” journalist Andrew Jones tweeted. “Wild.”

Several other Chinese startups have similarly proposed rocket designs that rip off SpaceX’s Starship, from Cosmoleap, which painstakingly recreated the concept down to a render of a Super Heavy booster-like rocket being caught by a launch tower by two extremely familiar-looking “chopstick” arms. A separate firm, called Astronstone, also said it was looking to recreate the concept, “fully aligning its technical approach with Elon Musk’s SpaceX,” albeit at a smaller scale.

Even a heavy lift rocket China’s national space officials showed off a year ago bore a striking resemblance to Starship, from a “two-stage, fully reusable configuration” right down to the aerodynamic flaps.

But when it comes to turning flashy renders into reality, China still has plenty of catching up to do when it comes to reusable rocketry on the whole. Case in point, earlier this month, private Chinese space company LandScape attempted to launch and land its reusable and Falcon 9-like Zhuque-3 rocket booster, only for it to explode during its first orbital test.

Even SpaceX itself is struggling to turn its mammoth Starship into a reliable platform that can send up to 150 metric tons to space in a single launch — which isn’t exactly surprising, given the project’s unprecedented scale.

Where that leaves far smaller Chinese companies vying for investor attention to cash in on Musk’s Moonshot idea remains unclear at best.

For one, even SpaceX has plenty to prove before it can assist NASA during its upcoming planned attempt to land the first astronauts on the lunar surface in over 50 years. The space agency is getting antsy, with NASA’s interim administrator Sean Duffy telling Fox News earlier this year that it’s looking for alternatives, arguing that SpaceX is “behind schedule” for the mission, which is tentatively scheduled for 2027.

In the meantime, users on the SpaceXLounge subreddit are less than convinced China will beat SpaceX to the punch when it comes to Starship.

“Until they make a reliable and working full-flow engine, all these copy efforts won’t be worth diddly squat,” one Reddit user wrote. “But will look neat and sometimes explode with a lot of fireworks!”

“I wish they would mimic our free speech like they mimic our technology,” another user added facetiously.

            <h2>3I/ATLAS Still Showing Strange Protrusion as It Approaches Earth</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth mere days from now, coming within just 167 million miles — a significant gulf, but a mere stone’s throw on the cosmic scale.

It’s an exciting moment that’ll give astronomers an unprecedented chance to point both ground- and space-based telescopes at the unusual visitor. They’ve been following the object, which is broadly believed to be a comet, for months now as it screams through the solar system.

Ever since NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope first gazed upon the object on July 21, scientists noticed a strange protrusion jutting out of the object, a second tail that counterintuitively points directly at the Sun, not away from it like the characteristic tails of familiar solar system comets.

This “anti-tail” could be the result of “enhanced mass loss in the Sun-facing side,” as Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb told Futurism earlier this year, which causes larger fragments to be broken off. These larger fragments are less susceptible to being affected by the Sun’s radiation pressure, causing them to move more slowly and accumulate on the Sun-facing side.

Over a month after its perihelion, or closest pass of the Sun, observations still clearly show 3I/ATLAS’ anti-tail, as Loeb noted in a new update on his blog. A December 13 image taken by the Teerasak Thaluang telescope in Rayong, Thailand “shows a prominent anti-tail, uncommon for comets, pointing in the direction of the Sun,” he wrote.

Judging by the “thousands of images” taken since Hubble’s July observations, which show 3I/ATLAS’ anti-tail, Loeb argued that it’s “not a perspective effect,” but a “real physical jet.”

“Its nature is a mystery because gas and micrometer-dust particles are expected to be pushed away from the Sun by solar radiation pressure and the solar wind, creating the appearance of a tail — as routinely seen in solar-system comets,” Loeb wrote.

As he tends to do, Loeb argued that there’s still a chance we could be looking at an alien spacecraft instead of a natural comet. He posited that the anti-tail could be a “swarm of objects that lag behind 3I/ATLAS because of its non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun,” as he detailed in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper.

However, others aren’t convinced of such a possibility, arguing the object’s two tails are nothing out of the ordinary, even despite 3I/ATLAS’ interstellar origins.

“It’s ejecting dust particles towards the Sun, because the day side of the nucleus is the hot side,” UCLA astronomy professor and comet expert David Jewitt told Sky and Telescope last month.

“All these things are consistent with a comet nucleus of typical size or smaller, sublimating in sunlight and blowing out dust particles,” he added. “Nothing really shocking there.”

In a September 29 blog post, Pennsylvania State University astronomer Jason Wright also criticized Loeb’s unusual conclusion that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft, pointing out several previous observations of “similar sunward enhancement” caused by large, ejected dust grains that “don’t get swept up by the solar wind on the Sun-facing side of a comet.”

European Space Agency scientists have also suggested the secondary, observed tail could be a “dust tail” made up of tiny solid particles, which are typical for solar system comets.

Even Loeb himself is leaving every possibility open, authoring two other papers suggesting the anti-tail is the result of the “scattering of sunlight by fragments of ice shed from the sun-facing side of 3I/ATLAS.”

“These tiny ice particles evaporate before they get pushed back significantly by the solar radiation pressure and so they never appear as a conventional cometary tail,” he wrote in his latest blog.

Nonetheless, Loeb argued that we should be ready to expect the unexpected.

“By recognizing anomalies, we can learn something new,” he concluded. “By ignoring them, we remain ignorant.”

            <h2>Nuclear startup Last Energy raises $100M for its steel-encased micro reactor</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After years in the wilderness, it’s a good time to be a nuclear startup.

“For the first half a decade that I was telling people I was doing nuclear, I had to convince them, ‘Hey, here’s why nuclear is important,’” Bret Kugelmass, founder and CEO of Last Energy, told TechCrunch. “Now everyone just comes to us saying, ‘Oh yeah, of course nuclear is a key part of the solution.’ I’m like, okay, great, I’m glad everyone’s caught up now.”

Last Energy is building small modular reactors — compact nuclear power plants that can be mass-manufactured to reduce costs. The company’s reactors are designed to produce 20 megawatts of electricity, enough to power roughly 15,000 homes.

It has momentum. Last Energy just closed a $100 million Series C led by the Astera Institute with participation from AE Ventures, Galaxy Fund, Gigafund, JAM Fund, The Haskell Company, Ultranative, Woori Technology, and others.

The company joins a slew of nuclear startups that have raised funding in recent months, buoyed by data centers’ insatiable power demands. Google-backed X-Energy raised $700 million last month, while Antares raised $96 million two weeks ago. And in August, Aalo Atomics raised $100 million to build its prototype reactor.

What sets Last Energy apart from competitors is its approach: the company is using an old reactor design developed by the government decades ago. The initial design for the pressurized water reactor was built for the NS Savannah, the world’s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. That ship’s power plant was about one-tenth the size of Last Energy’s planned commercial reactor. Kugelmass said the company’s updated design should produce 20 megawatts of electricity.

The company is starting smaller, though. First, Last Energy is building a 5-megawatt pilot reactor at a site it’s leasing from Texas A&M. The new funding will fully fund the pilot project and help the company start delivering its first commercial products, Kugelmass said. Last Energy hopes to turn on the pilot reactor next year, with its 20-megawatt commercial-scale unit entering production in 2028.

Last Energy’s startup’s reactor isn’t designed to be serviced during its lifetime. Instead, Last Energy is permanently encasing each core in 1,000 tons of steel. Kugelmass estimates the metal will cost around $1 million. “Most people think concrete is cheaper,” he said. “But not when it’s nuclear-grade concrete.”

The reactors will arrive on site fueled with six years’ worth of uranium. Apart from electrical and control connections, there are no other penetrations that break the steel wall. Heat from the fission reactions warms the steel, and water flowing through pipes on the outside harvests that heat to spin a steam turbine.

When the reactor’s time is up, Last Energy will leave it on site, with the steel chamber serving as the waste cask, eliminating the need for separate disposal.

The hope is that this approach, coupled with manufacturing advances, will drive down the price of nuclear power. Kugelmass wouldn’t commit to a price, instead pointing to other industries that have halved prices for every tenfold increase in production.

“I don’t think it’s going to be that good in nuclear because there are always some extra fixed costs that you have in nuclear regarding some of the special regulations, but that’s the type of trend you can see,” he said. “We don’t think in ones and twos, we think in tens of thousands.”

            <h2>Everbloom built an AI to turn chicken feathers into cashmere</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: if you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.

Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market.

“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.”

Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.

To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.

At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: they’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process.

The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”

To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.

The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement.

“All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.

Plus, it should be cheaper, too. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”

            <h2>Solo VC and Lovable investor Neil Murray raises third Nordic-focused fund</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Nordic red-hot startup movement continues. On Tuesday, Neil Murray, founder and general partner at Copenhagen-based firm The Nordic Web Ventures, announced the close of a $6 million Fund III to continue investing in early-stage founders in the region.

The fund will focus on writing the first institutional checks to companies focused on robotics, AI-native companies, and deep tech founders.

Murray, a solo GP, told TechCrunch that his first two funds were “test vehicles” to prove his ability to spot and invest in top talent in the region. Now, seven years later, he has written the first check into more than 50 companies, with a portfolio including the unicorn Lovable and the remote worker insurance company SafetyWing, and exits like the UI design company Uizard.

As TechCrunch previously reported, the Nordic ecosystem (which includes Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is now valued at more than half a trillion dollars and received more than $8 billion in venture funding in 2024, making the region one of the hottest emerging markets in Europe. Murray said Fund III had more than $20 million in investor interest, but he decided to cap it at $6 million because he cares “more about alignment than AUM.”

Staying small, he said, means he can better tie incentives to performance rather than management fees. He also said staying small, especially as a solo GP, gives him more flexibility while “everyone else is still debating.”

“Capping the fund wasn’t a constraint,” he said. “It was the strategy.”

The check sizes for the fund will be around $200,000, and he hopes to back between 30 and 35 companies. “I believe it is more important to be investing in Tier 1 founders than to back Tier 2 founders and over-optimizing for ownership,” he said.

Murray’s limited partner base includes institutional backers such as Allocater One, founder Christoph Janz, and Pacenotes. Founders from Kahoot! And Pleo, in addition to operators from Meta and Google, is also LPs in Fund III.

“Many founders from my first two funds have invested in my new fund, which is also an incredibly important metric to me,” he said, adding that he’s already returned more than half the capital he raised across Fund I and Fund II.

His Fund III focuses on AI, robotics, and consumer, he said, because those are some of the top sectors in the Nordic region. Consumer has always been a top category in the sector, as TechCrunch previously spoke about on a podcast about the region.

The region is also known for its computer science, engineering culture, and manufacturing, which, paired with a “calm methodical build style,” positions the Nordics well for “AI-powered robotics in industrial, healthcare, logistics, and increasingly consumer context.”

Though he has a keen interest in the Nordics, Murray actually hails from the UK and moved to Denmark in 2013 without knowing a single person, he recalled.

“I was very interested in tech startups, having worked in digital products in London,” he continued. When he moved to Copenhagen, he realized the ecosystem has had a big contribution to the tech world, though people hardly spoke up about it. That led him to start the website “The Nordic Web,” where he broke down what was happening behind the curtains of the bugeoning tech scene there.

That website saw him tracking investments and exits and soon, VCs were asking him which founders were looking for capital. Soon, Murray wanted in on the action, and in 2017, launched a $500,000 Fund I. He stopped writing The Nordic Web shortly after to focus more on investing. And all of that has led him here.

“Overall, the Nordics aren’t experiencing a ‘moment,’” he said. “They’re experiencing a compounding. The depth of talent, the ambition level, and the maturity of the ecosystem mean this wave isn’t a spike; it’s the foundation of the next decade of Nordic breakout companies.”

            <h2>The Problem With Comparing Big Food to Big Tobacco</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without fail, any corporation accused of conspiring against public health will be compared to Big Tobacco. When oil companies downplayed the threat of climate change, they were allegedly following in the footsteps of cigarette manufacturers. The NFL’s strategy for disputing the link between football and concussions has similarly been likened to the tobacco industry’s actions. The online-gambling industry has supposedly acted like Big Tobacco, as have the tech industry and the plastic industry.

Earlier this month, one such comparison ended up in a lawsuit. In the first such case of its kind, San Francisco sued several of the nation’s largest food companies—including Kraft Heinz, Nestle USA, and PepsiCo—alleging that they had copied the tobacco industry’s playbook by deliberately engineering processed food to be irresistible and then concealing the risks. “They used Big Tobacco tactics to research, design, and sell addictive products,” David Chiu, the city attorney, said at a press conference.

What is this comparison really saying? An executive focused on selling more Oreos or cans of Mountain Dew might have an interest in encouraging unhealthy dietary habits, but that is not self-evidently the same as the misdeeds of the tobacco industry, which for decades covered up the evidence that cigarettes cause cancer while continuing to sell what’s been called the most dangerous consumer product ever.

I ran the analogy by several nutrition experts. “Of course, food is more complicated than tobacco,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor at New York University, told me. The risks of cigarettes are well established, but researchers still struggle to define what even counts as an ultra-processed food, let alone pinpoint the exact reason these foods prompt people to overeat. However, there are notable similarities between the two industries and the products they sell, she said. Researchers do know that ultra-processed foods such as Coca-Cola and Pringles are among the biggest contributors to obesity and other diet-related diseases, which are linked to an estimated 1 million deaths in the United States each year.

Read: Coke, Twinkies, Skittles, and … whole-grain bread?

The two industries also use similar strategies to cast doubt on the dangers of their products. Junk-food companies “know the harm they’re doing, and they do it anyway,” Robert Lustig, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at UC San Francisco, told me. Consider Coca-Cola: Roughly a decade ago, the food giant funded a think tank that reportedly attempted to shift the focus of obesity away from poor diets and instead highlight the role that exercise can play in weight management. Like Big Tobacco, food companies have also attempted to convince consumers that some of their unhealthy products might actually be good for them. In 2016, Coca-Cola settled a lawsuit filed by consumer advocates alleging that the company falsely advertised Vitaminwater as containing just vitamins and water; as part of the settlement, the company agreed to change its marketing and note on its bottles that the drink contains sweeteners.

For decades, Big Tobacco and Big Food were in many cases one and the same. In 1985, the tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds bought Nabisco; three years later, Philip Morris, the company responsible for the Marlboro Man, acquired Kraft Foods. Philip Morris later purchased Nabisco and absorbed it into Kraft, before relinquishing control of the company in 2007. It was during this time period that junk food became so irresistible. A recent study found that from 1988 to 2001, foods developed by tobacco-owned companies versus other companies were far more likely to be “hyperpalatable,” meaning they contained large quantities of carbs, fat, and salt.

Food companies deny comparisons to Big Tobacco. A spokesperson for the Consumer Brands Association, a lobbying group that represents packaged-food companies, told me that “attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.” I reached out to the 11 food companies named in the San Francisco lawsuit and heard back from only Coca-Cola. A company spokesperson told me in an email that comparisons between Big Food and Big Tobacco are flawed, and pointed out that Coca-Cola also sells a variety of “low‑ and no‑sugar options.” In response to the claims that Coca-Cola has downplayed the effects of its products on obesity, the spokesperson said that the company has since strengthened its “transparency standards” and allows the researchers it funds to “control the design, data and publication to ensure objectivity.”

Comparing Big Food and Big Tobacco is certainly an evocative rhetorical device. It underscores the severity of America’s obesity problem, and it points out that the way food is manufactured can itself be part of the problem. Villainizing food companies has become a popular message—one that has galvanized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Food giants “are literally poisoning our children systematically for profit,” Kennedy said last year. As HHS secretary, Kennedy has cracked down on ultra-processed food, pushing states to ban the purchase of soda with food stamps and pressuring companies to phase out synthetic food dyes.

And yet, Americans still love Big Food. Hershey’s, Heinz Ketchup, and M&M’s are among America’s most trusted brands, according to a recent Morning Consult report. As a result, drastic measures that would improve diet-related disease in this country—the kinds that were used against the tobacco industry—are still quite unpopular. Cigarette taxes have proved to reduce smoking rates, but attempts to levy even a small tax on soda have failed in cities across the country. Other ideas, such as creating a minimum age to buy junk food, aren’t even discussed by lawmakers. I asked Chiu, the San Francisco city attorney, if he would support such a policy, and he punted. “My office is employing our tools as we can to address this crisis in front of us,” he told me, “but we welcome other actors and stakeholders to be involved.”

In some ways, comparing Big Food to Big Tobacco undersells just how difficult it will be to remedy the problems with the American diet. To push Americans away from cigarettes, public-health advocates had a simple message: Don’t smoke. There is no equivalent slogan for food. Although roughly 40 percent of American adults smoked in the 1960s, when cigarettes were at their most popular, ultra-processed foods are everywhere in 2025. They make up more than 50 percent of what adults eat at home. They’re not just Kit Kat bars and Twinkies but also Campbell’s soup, Wonder Bread, and Hot Pockets. The world can live without cigarettes, but the same cannot be said of food.</div>

            <h2>The Entry-Level Hiring Process Is Breaking Down</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even in the best of times, searching for a first job after college is an exercise in patience, resilience, and coping with rejection. And these are not the best of times. Companies have no idea whom to hire, applicants have no idea how to stand out, and everyone is miserable.

Historically, new college graduates were more likely to have a job than the average worker. Now, however, the recent-grad unemployment rate is slightly higher than that of the overall workforce. That’s in part because there are fewer positions to go around. Job postings on Handshake, a career-services platform for college students and recent graduates, have fallen by more than 16 percent in the past year, and companies are warning that this year’s entry-level job market could be even worse. (To be clear, the unemployment rate for recent graduates is still far lower than the rate for young people who didn’t go to college, and workers with a college degree continue to outearn those without.)

Another factor is making job hunting even grimmer: The hiring process is starting to break down. In the past, companies looking for fresh entry-level talent could rely on a college graduate’s GPA as a mark of their intelligence and work ethic. Hiring managers could assess a candidate’s cover letter and interview performance to get a sense of their writing and communication skills. Now those signals have lost much of their value. Rampant grade inflation has rendered GPAs almost meaningless. The widespread use of AI to write cover letters—and even to assist with job-interview performance—has robbed those assessments of their predictive power.

Two decades ago, fewer than a quarter of Harvard undergraduate grades were A’s. Today, 60 percent are. The trend holds across universities. A recent analysis of first-year courses at eight large public universities found that grades have been rising for more than a decade. (At the same time, standardized-test scores have fallen, suggesting that students aren’t simply getting smarter.) As the gap between grades and achievement has grown, companies are finding that transcripts are no longer a strong measure of student achievement. Blair Ciesil, a co-leader of talent attraction at McKinsey, told me that the consulting firm now looks at whether students studied one of the most challenging majors or earned a dual degree. Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard’s dean of undergraduate education, says that employers tell her that they struggle to tell different Harvard students apart. Seven years ago, 70 percent of new graduates’ résumés were screened by GPA, according to surveys by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Now that number is 40 percent.

Rose Horowitch: The perverse consequences of the easy A

At the same time, cover letters and writing samples have become less reliable evidence of applicants’ abilities. (As anyone who has ever written or read a cover letter knows, they were never a perfect measure of ability. But they at least helped recruiters distinguish between candidates.) Two recent working papers found that for applicants on Freelancer.com, a job site connecting freelancers with employers, cover-letter quality used to strongly predict who would get a job and how well they would perform. Then ChatGPT became available. “We basically find the collapse of this entire signaling mechanism,” Jesse Silbert, one of the researchers, told me. Julie Bedard, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, told me that her clients report receiving more and more applications that reach a baseline level of quality, but they all sound the same. At least half of the companies she works with say that cover letters are no longer helpful in hiring. Many are eliminating them.

In addition to turning job applications into mush, AI also makes them far easier to produce. Submitting an application used to require at least some investment of time and effort, automatically screening out people who weren’t committed enough to go through the process. Now AI can complete one in seconds. The result is that companies are inundated with applications (some of which are surely submitted by AI bots). Handshake data show that the average number of applications per open job has increased by 26 percent in the past year. Some companies are taking down job postings after only a few days to limit the number of applicants. And because more people are competing for each job, recent graduates are forced to submit far more applications than they once did. Louise Jackson, director of the University of Michigan career center, told me that it used to be extreme for students to submit 100 applications. “We’re definitely past that number now,” she said. Students at UC Berkeley are applying to 150 internships just to get one or two interviews, Sue Harbour, the head of career engagement at the school, told me. The easier AI makes it to apply for a job, the harder it becomes to actually get one.

To handle the AI-driven influx of applications, employers have turned to—what else?—AI. LinkedIn recently launched a tool that allows recruiters to search profiles for specific skills and cull the irrelevant ones. Hari Srinivasan, a vice president of product management at LinkedIn, told me that this cuts the number of applications recruiters have to look at by 70 percent. “It’s a really weird wild west,” Kyle M. K., a senior talent-strategy adviser at Indeed, told me. Job seekers are trying to create an application that will make it through the screening process, and recruiters are trying to limit the number of applications that make it through. “You’ve got two human beings trying to fight off the robot on the other side,” M. K. said. This has created something of an AI arms race as each party searches for any advantage.

Read: People are using AI to cheat on job interviews

Some companies are trying to sidestep that race by focusing more on measurable skills. Hirers at tech and consulting companies are adding more rounds of tests and trial projects (often in locked-down browsers to try to prevent applicants from using AI), focusing on prior internships, and looking at student extracurriculars. “I think most people who graduate from school feel the degree is their output,” Srinivasan, at LinkedIn, told me. “I would encourage them to think about the degree plus the work product.”

The rise of AI in the hiring process might be worth the costs if it were democratizing the hiring process, expanding opportunity to less privileged graduates. It is not. Shawn VanDerziel, the head of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, told me that in the absence of useful achievement metrics, many companies are ramping up recruitment efforts at their “target schools”—selective universities with alumni who have previously worked for the company. And personal referrals have come to matter more than ever, Zack Mabel, director of research at Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce, told me. This approach might help companies find qualified candidates, but it further helps the applicants who are already the most privileged.

To any individual college graduate, having a high GPA and access to a magic application-writing machine makes finding a job dramatically easier. But the collective effect of grade inflation and chatbots has been precisely the opposite. That’s the thing about advantages: Sometimes, when everyone has them, they stop being advantageous.</div>

            <h2>The Longest Suicide Note in American History</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, a team of American diplomats from the State Department’s Global Engagement Center traveled to two dozen countries and signed a series of memoranda. Along with their counterparts in places as varied as Italy, Australia, and Ivory Coast, they agreed to jointly expose malicious and deceptive online campaigns originating in Russia, China, or Iran.

This past September, the Trump administration terminated these agreements. The center’s former head, James Rubin, called this decision “a unilateral act of disarmament,” and no wonder: In effect, the United States was declaring that it would no longer oppose Russian influence campaigns, Chinese manipulation of local politics, or Iranian extremist recruitment drives. Nor would the American government use any resources to help anyone else do so either.

The recent publication of the Trump administration’s new National Security Strategy showed that this decision was no accident. Unilateral disarmament is now official policy. Because—despite its name—this National Security Strategy is not really a strategy document. It is a suicide note. If the ideas within it are really used to shape policy, then U.S. influence in the world will rapidly disappear, and America’s ability to defend itself and its allies will diminish. The consequences will be economic as well as political, and they will be felt by all Americans.

Before explaining, I should acknowledge the curious features of this document, which seems, like the Bible, to have several different authors. Some of them use boastful, aggressive language—America must remain “the world’s strongest, richest, most powerful country for decades to come”—and some of them prefer euphemism and allusion. Sometimes these different authors contradict one another, proposing to work with allies on one page and to undermine allies on the next. The views expressed in the document do not represent those of the entire U.S. government, the entire Republican Party, or even the entire Trump administration. The most noteworthy elements seem to come from a particular ideological faction, one that now dominates foreign-policy thinking in this administration and may well dominate others in the future.

The one genuinely new, truly radical element in this faction’s thinking is its absolute refusal to acknowledge the existence of enemies or to name any countries that might wish America ill. This is a major departure from the first Trump administration. The 2017 National Security Strategy spoke of creating an alliance against North Korea; noted that Russia is “using subversive measures to weaken the credibility of America’s commitment to Europe, undermine transatlantic unity, and weaken European institutions and governments”; and observed that China is “using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats” to bully others. The 2017 Trump policy team also observed a “geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order.”

The second Trump administration can no longer identify any specific countries that might wish harm to the United States, or any specific actions they might be taking to do harm. A decade’s worth of Russian cyberwarfare, political intervention, and information war inside the United States goes unmentioned. Russian acts of sabotage across Europe, Russian support for brutal regimes across the Sahel region of Africa, and, of course, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine aren’t important either. None of these Russian acts of aggression gets a mention except for the war in Ukraine, which is described solely as a concern for Europeans.

Phillips Payson O’Brien: A wider war has already started in Europe

Even more strangely, China appears not as a geopolitical competitor but largely as a trading rival. It’s as if Chinese hacking and cyberwar did not exist, as if China were not seeking to collect data or infiltrate the software that controls U.S. infrastructure. China’s propaganda campaigns and business deals in Africa and Latin America, which could squeeze out American rivals, don’t seem to matter much either. The new document makes only a vague allusion to a Chinese economic presence in Latin America and to a Chinese threat to Taiwan. When discussing this latter possibility, the authors drop their swaggering language about American power and slip into bureaucratese: “The United States does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.”

Other rivals and other potential sources of conflict get no mention at all. North Korea has disappeared. Iran is described as “greatly weakened.” Islamist terrorism is no longer worth mentioning. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still “thorny,” but thanks to President Donald Trump, “progress toward a more permanent peace has been made.” Hamas will soon fade away. The American troops who are still fighting in Somalia and Syria—and in some cases dying—are ignored, as if they didn’t exist at all.

But if America has no rivals and expects no conflicts, then neither the military nor the State Department nor the CIA nor the counterintelligence division of the FBI needs to make any special preparations to defend Americans from them. The document reflects that assumption and instead directs the U.S. national-security apparatus to think about “control over our borders,” “natural disasters,” “unfair trading practices,” “job destruction and deindustrialization,” and other threats to trade. Fentanyl gets a mention. So, rather strangely, do “propaganda, influence operations, and other forms of cultural subversion”—although there is no indication of who might be using propaganda and cultural subversion against us or how it might be countered, especially because the Trump administration has completely dismantled all of the institutions designed to do so.

But what if this document was not written for the people and institutions that think about national security at all? Maybe it was instead written for a highly ideological domestic audience, including the audience in the Oval Office. The authors have included ludicrous but now-familiar language about Trump having ended many wars, a set of claims as absurd and fanciful as his FIFA Peace Prize. The authors also go out of their way to dismiss all past American foreign-policy strategies, presumably including those pursued by the first Trump administration, as if only this administration, under this near-octogenarian president, can see the world clearly.

Finally, although they do not name any states that might threaten America, the authors do focus on one enemy ideology. It is not Chinese communism, Russian autocracy, or Islamic extremism but rather European liberal democracy. This is what this radical faction really fears: people who talk about transparency, accountability, civil rights, and the rule of law. Not coincidentally, these are the same people whom the MAGA ideologues hate and dislike at home, the same people who are fighting to prevent MAGA from redefining the United States as a white ethnostate, who oppose the corruption of America’s democratic institutions, and who object when Trump’s friends, family, and tech allies redirect U.S. foreign policy to benefit their private interests.

European and American liberal democracy is so dangerous to their project, in fact, that the MAGA ideologues seem to be planning to undermine it. They don’t want to meddle in anyone’s internal politics anywhere else on the planet: “We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change.” The glaring exception to this rule is in Europe. Here, it is now American policy to “help Europe correct its current trajectory,” language that implies that the U.S. will intervene to do so.

Eliot A. Cohen: Trump’s security strategy is incoherent babble

According to reporting by Defense One, an earlier version of the National Security Strategy said that U.S. foreign policy should even seek to support illiberal forces in at least four countries—Hungary, Poland, Italy, and Austria—to persuade them to leave the European Union. For all four, this would be an economic catastrophe; for the rest of the continent, this would be a security catastrophe, because a damaged EU would struggle to counter Russian hybrid warfare and Chinese economic pressure. If the union breaks up, there would also no longer be a European Commission capable of regulating American tech companies, and perhaps that is the point.

At the same time, the document’s authors seem to derive their hatred of Europe from a series of false perceptions—or, perhaps, from a form of projection. The authors fear, for example, that “certain NATO members will become majority non-European” very soon. Because they are presumably not talking about non-European Turkey and Canada, the clear implication is that countries such as France and Germany have so much immigration from outside Europe that they will be majority nonwhite. And yet, it is the United States, not Europe, that is far more likely to become “majority minority” in the coming years.

The security strategy also talks, bizarrely, about Europe being on the verge of “civilizational erasure,” which is not language used by many European politicians, even those in far-right parties. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, has called this sentiment “to the right of the extreme right.” In multiple indices, after all—health, happiness, standard of living—European countries regularly rank higher than the United States. Compared with Americans, Europeans live longer, are less likely to be living on the streets, and are less likely to die in mass shootings.

The only possible conclusion: The authors of this document don’t know much about Europe, or don’t care to find out. Living in a fantasy world, they are blind to real dangers. They invent fictional threats. Their information comes from conspiracist websites and random accounts on X, and if they use these fictions to run policy, then all kinds of disasters could await us. Will our military really stop working with allies with whom we have cooperated for decades? Will the FBI stop looking for Russian and Chinese spies? Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced that it was taking action against two Russian state-sponsored cybercriminal groups that, among other things, targeted American industrial infrastructure. But if our real enemy is “civilizational erasure” in Europe, then surely we should redirect resources away from this kind of secondary problem and focus them on the threat posed by the British Labour Party or the German Christian Democrats.

One is tempted to laugh at these kinds of ideas, to express incredulity or turn away. But similar conspiracist thinking has already done real damage to real institutions. Elon Musk believed distorted or completely false stories about USAID that he read on his own X platform. As a result, he destroyed the entire organization so rapidly and so thoughtlessly that tens or even hundreds of thousands of people may die as a result. At the State Department, Darren Beattie, the undersecretary for public diplomacy, has repeatedly and falsely stated that the Global Engagement Center was censoring Americans, a fantasy that he encountered on the internet and that he continues to repeat without proof. As a result, he destroyed that organization and ended its international negotiations. He is now conducting an internal departmental witch hunt, trying to find or perhaps invent post hoc evidence for his conspiracist ideas.

Charlie Warzel: Everything is the ‘Twitter Files’ now

Some elements of this story are familiar. Americans have overestimated, underestimated, or misunderstood their rivals before. And when they do, they make terrible mistakes. In 2003, many American analysts sincerely thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. During the Cold War, many analysts believed that the Soviet Union was stronger and less fragile than it proved to be. But I am not sure whether there has ever been a moment like this one, when the American government’s most prominent foreign-policy theorists have transferred their domestic obsessions to the outside world, projecting their own fears onto others. As a result, they are likely to misunderstand who could challenge, threaten, or even damage the United States in the near future. Their fantasy world endangers us all.</div>

They operate on the same wavelength of evil as banks do, so I guess why not?

Makes sense in a world that Goldman Sachs is the biggest &quot;industrial&quot; in the Dow Jones Industrial Average..

I used PayPal for a while 10 or 15 years ago, back then they were a bank - at least in the EU.

Didn&#39;t Paypal buy or merge with X.com (Elon Musk), who looks like they acquired a bank many years ago?

X.com Corporation has entered into an agreement with Community Bankshares, Inc., to purchase its subsidiary, First Western National Bank (FWNB), subject to regulatory approvals. Until such approvals are obtained, FWNB is providing the banking services available through X.com on a contractual basis.  https://web.archive.org/web/20... [archive.org]

That&#39;s the joke. The EU has rules about handling people&#39;s money, PayPal is a registered bank in Luxembourg which is why www.paypalsucks.com had stories almost exclusively American based, because things like arbitrarily freezing customer&#39;s financial accounts is likely to get the regulator to shove their foot up your arse in Europe.

Ok, so if PayPal becomes a US bank, will it offer free Zelle inbound and outbound money transfers?If they don&#39;t, will people still be stupid and lazy enough to have their money eaten away by digital transfer fees?If they do, will people still be stupid and lazy enough to have their money eaten away by digital transfer fees?&quot;PayPal&quot;, is not the reason.

When the climate gives you meetings, why not make electricity from it? Just surround the Alps with dams and it could generate a few trillion megawatts of free electricity to the world.

This has been going on for decades due to man made climate change. That the alpine glaciers will be gone within a decade has just about been common knowledge too. The true story is that time is quickly running out on getting an eco-turnaround happening that will prevent the worst.

IIRC, it was Egypt that said they would go to war if any of the other countries attempted to dam or restrict the Nile. That was in the 80s.

Basically holding the other countries in the Nile basin at the end of a gun.

But yes, the wars of water will make the petro-wars seem tame in comparison.

(Imagine the images of Luke on Tatooine, tending to a water harvester, .... but now on earth, that&#39;s the future).

When they haven&#39;t done thiis, what do we do then?

For Gregg Phillips, Monday marked his first day as the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery. For the agency, it marked the beginning of a new era: one in which a genuine conspiracy theorist holds its second-most-powerful position.

Phillips, to be clear, is no mere hobbyist when it comes to dangerous conspiracy theories. He was a major figure behind the organization True the Vote, one of the most influential sources of election-fraud misinformation during the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Phillips and True the Vote claimed to have evidence of millions of fraudulent votes, as well as of Chinese efforts to steal the election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but Phillips was reckless in his campaign, in terms of both his methods and his friends. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, Phillips developed numerous ties to the QAnon world as he sought allies in his efforts.

On Truth Social, he repeatedly shared posts from accounts with Q-related logos or names and screen grabs from Q drops, the messages left behind by the purported “Q” figure. He also posted directly to praise known QAnon influencers as friends and clever investigators. He appeared as a guest on several QAnon podcasts and even participated in QAnon’s “Flannel Fridays,” a symbol of solidarity with the movement. He made at least a dozen appearances on the Matrixxx Grooove Show, a livestream hosted by two QAnon supporters. He and the founder of True the Vote put on an event in Arizona that courted QAnon influencers, allowing over a dozen such influencers to network in person. He praised them all as patriots ready to expose the ways in which the “enemy” had stolen millions of votes from Donald Trump. Phillips, in other words, peddles in MAGA fantasies.

This appointment would have been a worrying one for any governmental department—the position, which oversee’s the agency’s largest division, does not require congressional approval—but it’s especially concerning when paired with FEMA. That’s because FEMA, more than just about any other agency, is a central entity in some of the oldest right-wing conspiracy theories about ambitiously menacing government schemes, which include everything from secret prison camps to human-caused hurricanes.

Beyond being ridiculous, experts say, having a conspiracy theorist leading the core work of a conspiracy theory–targeted entity could be dangerous. There are real reasons to worry that a person dismissive of mainstream expertise could derail the work of nonpartisan bureaucrats trying to protect the public. He could sideline technical experts, delay action during time-sensitive emergencies, and undermine important communication from the agency. And he could find innovative new ways to disrupt the agency’s work.

We have seen this play out already, in other personnel decisions from the Trump administration. Kash Patel runs the FBI, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the Health and Human Services Department. Both were chosen because they were convinced that evil had taken root in their respective agencies. During this second Trump administration, Kennedy’s pursuit of his convictions has been catastrophic: The administration has already rolled back vaccine mandates and helped cause deadly epidemics. Patel has inflicted less direct harm on the public, but he purged the bureau’s ranks and replaced them with loyalists, seriously compromising the trustworthiness of federal law enforcement.

So the question is what a similarly minded person could do in a place of such power in the country’s disaster-response agency. This will depend in part on what the administration decides to do with FEMA, as it is considering a major reorganization. But if FEMA remains the nation’s primary emergency-response infrastructure, and if it remains the central source of intel and coordination as climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, the presence of a conspiracy theorist in its top ranks could do very real harm. If a crusader with a paranoid mindset manages to remake FEMA’s disaster recovery into an arena for his grievances, it will mark the end of one of the most urgently nonpartisan roles of the federal government, a historic place of bipartisan agreement on the need to help suffering Americans, no matter who they are.

It makes some intuitive sense that FEMA would attract conspiracy theories, given that it’s the entity that’s most activated in times of crisis and confusion.

Ever since the 1980s and ’90s, people have theorized that FEMA was building secret prison camps to hold U.S. citizens upon the imposition of martial law; that it was planning to create major natural disasters in order to sow chaos nationwide and seize power; that it was setting up a surveillance state by inserting chips or other devices at agency “processing centers”; that it was testing out mind-control technologies or other sinister efforts when running emergency-alert-system tests; or that it would, in some other way, act as the supervillainy arm of whatever dark forces run the government or are plotting to take it over.

But these particular conspiracy theories, long fodder for the paranoid Alex Jones types, have moved toward the mainstream in recent years. They were boosted by QAnon during the general growth of American paranoia during the pandemic. Social media created incentives for content creators to spout engagement-baiting nonsense. And A.I. has obliterated our ability, as a general public, to distinguish reality from computer-generated fiction. As a result, the fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters that are becoming more frequent and more severe have reliably been followed by a flood of theories of FEMA’s malfeasance. Sometimes the old theories are regurgitated, with grainy videos of purported FEMA prison camps; other times, new pieces of information become the kernels at the core of new panicked rumors.

This is obviously not ideal. If people don’t trust the agency, they may not seek out its aid. They may heed warnings related to certain hazards in their environment. They may not listen when they are told to evacuate. In some cases, they may become desperate and turn to violence: One armed man was arrested last year for threatening agency employees in North Carolina, having been convinced by social media misinformation that FEMA was withholding supplies from storm victims.

“When you have this anti-science sentiment, which is intertwined with conspiracy theories, it worsens disaster outcomes across the board,” said Njoki Mwarumba, a professor of emergency management at Empire State University.

Having an anti-science figure in charge of disaster response will almost certainly make this situation worse, experts say. But this is not because Phillips will necessarily spread such conspiracy theories himself: Although it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Phillips would do so, there’s no evidence he believes in FEMA conspiracy theories. He has in the past expressed his opposition to FEMA’s existence, arguing that disaster response should instead be handled by local and state governments, but nothing has surfaced indicating he believes that the agency is pursuing a new world order. And because FEMA theories are so out there, they are presumably impossible to maintain once you’re inside the institution. A plot to take over the federal government or depopulate the country with a supervirus should be easy to sniff out from the top.

Instead, Phillips’ danger is in eroding public trust in the agency, leaving more room for conspiracy theories to flourish. Phillips has no experience in federal emergency management. He has also been accused of ethical misconduct multiple times in his professional career, including in his handling of government contracts in Mississippi and Texas; his financial management of True the Vote’s funds; and fundraising for a mobile hospital in Ukraine that never materialized. And given his pattern of acting purely on partisan motivation, it seems very possible that he will run his office on political priorities rather than data-driven analysis. That could mean that his version of FEMA’s response and recovery efforts will be inherently less trustworthy.

Putting a skeptic in charge of the agency, in other words, will make it less effective—and therefore legitimately more worthy of skepticism.

“When you can’t rely on the government or don’t trust the government, it further fuels conspiracy theories,” said Alice Marwick, the director of research at the nonprofit Data & Society. “It’s this horrible ouroboros.”

It’s reasonable to wonder if there’s a silver lining here. If a QAnon guy is tasked with overseeing a QAnon-suspected agency, wouldn’t that be reassuring to his fellow truthers?

This was a question that came up when Patel was placed in charge of the FBI. It seemed reasonable to assume that once Patel realized that there was no cabal running the bureau, he would be able to calm everyone down.

Instead, Patel, bumping up against the reality of bureaucracy, was forced into some awkward contortions, trying to convince people he was doing their work by firing Trump critics inside the agency, but ultimately unable to make good on any promises to dig up proof of treachery within the agency or release the promised Epstein files. Instead of deflating the conspiracy theories, this caused people to turn on Patel.

This reality is the same with the FEMA theories, Marwick said. “Where conspiracies don’t match the daily reality, you can have an immediate breakdown,” she said. “Conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied until someone shows them it’s controlled by the illuminati or a cabal or the Freemasons. So there’s no satisfactory resolution to this situation.”

And once the leader is unable to expose the corruption and reform the agency in the way the theorists want, that failure further proves the deep corruption of the system, she said. It reinforces public cynicism more than anything else.

Having an extremely partisan person in the position might instead encourage conspiracy theories from residents of blue states. Already, the Trump administration has weaponized grant funding for its own means. It is threatening to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from Democratic-led states over their refusal to share recipients’ immigration status. It slashed $8 billion in funding for green projects in Democratic states. And a judge blocked the administration’s effort to reallocate $233 million in FEMA disaster-relief funds away from a dozen blue states without explanation. The states accused the administration of targeting them for not backing Trump in the election.

And if draft proposals for “Fema 2.0” are any indication, the administration hopes to shift some of its funding toward block grants, in which pots of money are distributed by some to-be-determined metrics to individual states. Under that scenario, says Jeffrey Pellegrino, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at the University of Akron, the size of those pots could certainly be politically driven. That would inherently give blue-state residents reason to raise questions.

It’s unlikely these residents would jump from being suspicious of Trump’s FEMA to believing that the agency is about to round them all up in prison camps, turning into some kind of liberal version of Alex Jones. But this kind of politicization does shorten the distance between reality and conspiracy theory. It’s something we’ve never seen before, Pellegrino says. FEMA has historically fluctuated in efficacy depending on the president’s own sense of its urgency, he says, but it has never been all that tainted by partisan politics—as past administrators have always believed that natural disasters are not a partisan issue.

“But that seems to have gone by the wayside with the current administration,” he said.

Phillips will likely not be the RFK Jr. of FEMA. The far-out FEMA conspiracy theories, unlike “Vaccines Cause Autism,” are not particularly actionable. You can ban vaccines, but you cannot halt the building of prison camps that don’t actually exist or dismantle fictional offices that run mind-control programs. Nor will he be its Kash Patel, as he won’t be able to find as many exciting ways to weaponize the agency or root out politically charged projects; disaster management is simply more bureaucratic and less controversial.

The most important questions about FEMA currently concern its scope and, frankly, its survival while under assault from the administration. But having a committed conspiracy theorist in one of the most important positions in an organization long plagued by conspiracy-theory accusations only proves how little the administration cares about public trust. As climate change continues to make natural disasters worse, as the administration refuses to grapple with the dangers of A.I., and as severe cuts to nonpartisan agencies debilitate their relief and prevention work, conspiracy theories about FEMA will continue to proliferate. Disasters are frightening and destabilizing. They’re the kinds of events that naturally breed misinformation and confusion. In that scenario, you need an agency led by people who respond to crises with reason and levelheadedness in order to mitigate conspiratorial thinking. A responsible administrator might be counted on to stem that paranoia, to—at a critical moment—pull people back from their worst impulses. But Phillips has spent years preying on those impulses, and there’s little reason to hope he’ll stop now.

            <h2>Mozilla Corporation installs Firefox driver in CEO reboot</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mozilla Corporation on Tuesday said it has appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Laura Chambers, who served as interim CEO for the past two years.

Enzor-DeMeo has been the general manager of Firefox since August 2025. He joined Mozilla in December 2024 from Roofstock, a platform for real estate investors focused on the single-family rental market.

His appointment came with a commitment to expand Mozilla&#39;s involvement with AI services. According to the public benefit company, Enzor-DeMeo&#39;s browser stewardship has accelerated improvements in Firefox and has shown how Mozilla can responsibly integrate AI with the browsing experience. Firefox, the company claims, has enjoyed double-digit growth on mobile devices each of the past two years, and its market share has stabilized on the desktop.

We absolutely hear that some people want AI and some people don&#39;t

Mozilla cites AI-based features like Shake to Summarize on iOS, and AI Window as examples of Mozilla&#39;s approach to building AI in a way that&#39;s helpful and transparent.

&quot;The browser is AI&#39;s next battleground,&quot; said Enzor-DeMeo in a statement provided to The Register. &quot;It&#39;s where people live their online lives and where the next era&#39;s questions of trust, data use, and transparency will be decided.&quot;

The management transition also includes a new chief marketing officer, John Solomon, and the elevation of Ajit Varma from VP of Firefox Product to head of Firefox.

Mozilla signaled its interest in AI in early 2024, after a round of layoffs and close to the time when Chambers took over from Mitchell Baker.

Mozilla Foundation, which oversees subsidiaries Mozilla Corporation (Firefox), MZLA Technologies Corporation (Thunderbird), Mozilla AI, and Mozilla Ventures, also laid off staff in November 2024.

In January 2025, Mozilla Foundation president Mark Surman published a post alongside the release of the Foundation&#39;s 2022-2023 Annual Report in which he outlined Mozilla&#39;s effort to reinvent itself and remain relevant.

Since then, companies like Perplexity and OpenAI have integrated AI automation tools into their browsers, and leading browser makers like Google have taken similar steps.

And it has become clear that there&#39;s growing competition among browser makers and AI companies to redefine how people engage with the web and to promote automated interaction as an acceptable alternative to human-guided browsing.

With the appointment of a new CEO, Surman told The Register in an interview on Monday, &quot;You&#39;re gonna see, I think, an even deeper investment in reviving the browser as a really vibrant space.&quot;

Surman said we&#39;re in what some people describe as the third browser war, &quot;a period where, because of AI, people are launching new browsers and looking at what the technology can do,&quot; he said. &quot;In general, you&#39;ll see more fundamental innovation happening around the browser to give developers more capabilities.&quot;

The renewed focus on Firefox within Mozilla Corporation, Surman said, has internal and external explanations. &quot;Internally, I think we haven&#39;t had the leadership for the last few years to really drive us technically on what&#39;s possible with the tech stack we have,&quot; he said.

&quot;The external reason is really that the market for browsers and the space for innovation over browsers is really in motion again. And people have written browsers off as a commodity. Other people are innovating, and it creates a really good context for us to do the same again and to reinvest there.&quot;

It&#39;s not just Mozilla Corporation and Firefox that are scrambling to reinvent themselves. Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries are trying to do that too. Surman explained that this is happening in two different ways.

&quot;One is sort of broadening the focus, and the other is diversifying revenue,&quot; said Surman.

Mozilla&#39;s reputation in part rests upon its commitment to privacy, and that hasn&#39;t changed, Surman insists.

&quot;Our promise forever has been &#39;We don&#39;t touch data,&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;And so a lot of the changes in the last few years are figuring out how do we continue to stand for the manifesto and get into shaping the direction of AI in a way that is more human, still respects privacy, and all those kind of things.&quot;

What that means on a practical level, he said, can be seen in the formation of Mozilla Ventures and of Mozilla AI. The recruitment of talent to improve Firefox and Thunderbird, is another example of Mozilla’s changes, as are efforts to build AI in a way that gives people control and choice.

&quot;The big change in the business is at this point fairly internal and structural, to set us up to tackle AI in a way that reflects Mozilla&#39;s values,&quot; said Surman.

As to diversifying revenue, Surman said one of the ways Mozilla is doing so is through privacy-respecting ads in Firefox.

&quot;And so over the course of the last couple of years, you started to see a bigger chunk of our revenue come from that,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we&#39;re now probably down to 85-ish percent search revenue.&quot;

Previously, he said payments from Google accounted for around 95 percent of revenue.

Asked whether the shift toward AI-driven search as an alternative to traditional search has affected Firefox&#39;s search revenue, Surman insisted it hasn&#39;t had a meaningful impact.

Surman said that it&#39;s too early to say whether integrating AI into Firefox has impacted browser usage, because the AI Window feature hasn&#39;t yet launched. But he emphasized that Mozilla remains committed to user choice.

&quot;We absolutely hear that some people want AI and some people don&#39;t,&quot; he said. &quot;And so one of the things we&#39;re doing is looking at how we provide AI in the browser in a way that reflects Mozilla&#39;s values to those people who want it, and leave it completely optional so that it&#39;s not there for people who don&#39;t.&quot;

Beyond AI controls in Firefox, Surman said the reason Mozilla AI was spun out into a separate company was to push for open source to become the industry standard in AI. &quot;That&#39;s a big piece of being in control,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re not tied into an API. You&#39;re not just renting from a cloud AI provider. You can put it on your own machine or your own AWS instance. And I think a huge part of what you&#39;ll see us doing more of over the next year or two is really working with developers on open source AI because it&#39;s about that kind of choice.&quot; ®

            <h2>Intel hires ex-Trump fixer as Washington whisperer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel has hired a veteran Republican operator as its head of government affairs, just months after Uncle Sam became the struggling chip vendor&#39;s biggest shareholder.

In a shakeup of senior roles at the firm, Robin Colwell becomes senior vice president of government affairs, leading the company&#39;s &quot;global&quot; engagement with policymakers, regulators, and industry leaders.

&quot;She will focus on building trust, advancing Intel&#39;s strategic priorities, and positioning the company at the intersection of public policy, technology, and manufacturing,&quot; the company said in a statement.

&quot;Her leadership will be critical as Intel navigates policy, trade, national security, and opportunities with governments around the world,&quot; it added.

Though given its performance in recent years, does Intel really need someone else being critical?

Colwell certainly has broad experience in DC economic and technology policymaking.

Most recently, she was deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and deputy director of the National Economic Council. She spent the Biden administration at a DC lobbying firm, but before that was a special assistant to the president on economic policy from 2019 to 2021, and chief counsel for communications and technology for the House Energy and Commerce Committee from 2017 to 2019.

Colwell spent three years as chief of staff to FCC commissioner Mike O&#39;Rielly following a series of &quot;legislative counsel&quot; gigs for various Republican senators and house members.

Her former boss at the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, is currently one of the favorites to take over as chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Intel also appointed James Chew as VP of Intel Government Technologies, which looks after business with the US government. Chew was previously at Intel boss Lip-Bu Tan&#39;s former employer, Cadence Design Systems.

Meanwhile, Annie Shea Wessecker joins Intel from Samba Nova as SVP and chief marketing and communications officer.

The influx of outside talent doesn&#39;t leave Intel veterans completely in the cold. The firm has appointed Tan&#39;s chief of staff, Pushkar Ranade, as interim CTO. Ranade has spent most of his career at the company so he presumably knows his way around, which is just as well, as he&#39;ll be juggling two jobs.

This latest round of musical chairs changes the face of the company, with Colwell deepening its links with the America First mood in Washington.

But then companies always have to pay attention to the zeitgeist. After all, it&#39;s almost exactly 15 years since Intel appointed Black Eye Peas front man will.i.am as director of creative innovation. The brief was a &quot;multi-year, hands-on creative and technology collaboration with Intel Corporation.&quot;

Sadly, it seems that has faded out after a couple of years with Mr am becoming chief creative officer at 3D Systems in 2014.

Nevertheless, a look over Intel&#39;s stock chart shows the company&#39;s share price was on a rising trend following his appointment – a rise that only stumbled around the time Pat Gelsinger rejoined the company.

In fairness, Intel&#39;s share price has recovered strongly following Tan&#39;s appointment as CEO. But if Tan really wants to revive Intel, surely he will draft will.i.am back into the fold alongside Colwell and Chew. ®

            <h2>From pr0n to playlists and paperclips, trio of breaches spills data of millions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three very different companies have now confirmed data breaches affecting millions of users – each insisting the damage stopped well short of passwords and payment details.

Pornhub has told Premium subscribers that some user data was exposed after a breach at Mixpanel, a third-party analytics provider it once used, rather than through any compromise of Pornhub&#39;s own systems.

In a notice to users, the adult site said the incident affected &quot;only select Premium users&quot; and involved a limited set of analytics events inside Mixpanel&#39;s environment. Pornhub stressed that passwords, credentials, payment details, and government IDs were not exposed, and noted it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021 but was informed of the breach by the vendor.

The disclosure follows a similar incident last week affecting OpenAI, which traced a leak of internal data to compromised Mixpanel analytics credentials.

SoundCloud has also confirmed it was breached after a week of user complaints about outages and broken access, which the company now says were linked to a cybersecurity incident. The streaming platform said it detected unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard and brought in third-party security experts to investigate, eventually determining that the exposure affected roughly 20 percent of users.

According to public data, SoundCloud has approximately 140 million users, suggesting that some 28 million people have likely been affected by the breach.

According to SoundCloud, the data accessed was limited to email addresses and information already visible on public profiles, and did not include passwords or financial details. But the measures taken to contain the breach had side effects. Configuration changes introduced during the response caused &quot;temporary connectivity issues&quot; for some users, particularly those accessing the service via VPNs, effectively turning a behind-the-scenes security incident into a very public service disruption.

Over in Japan, retail giant Askul is still picking through the wreckage of an October ransomware attack that knocked systems offline and exposed customer data. In a new report [PDF], the office supplies and e-commerce giant said the incident caused &quot;large-scale service stoppage&quot; and confirmed that information it held &quot;flowed outside the company&quot; after its network was compromised.

In the report, translated by The Register, Akira Yoshioka, president and CEO of Askul, confirmed &quot;the recent ransomware attack resulted in the leak of customer information, as well as the information of some of our business partners, and we apologize for the significant inconvenience and concern this has caused.&quot;

Askul now says roughly 740,000 records linked to individual customers and corporate clients were affected, with some affected data published by the RansomHouse cybercrime crew, but says no financial details were accessed during the attack.

The lengthy report confirms that threat actors accessed Askul&#39;s internal systems using the login details of a subcontractor &quot;who exceptionally did not apply multi-factor authentication.&quot; The firm also admits that the datacenter where the breach occurred &quot;did not have EDR installed on its servers, nor was 24-hour monitoring performed, so unauthorized access and intrusion could not be detected immediately.&quot;

Ransomware infection was confirmed in logistics and internal systems, and some data (including backups) was encrypted and rendered unusable. In addition, some of that data was stolen and leaked by the attacker.

Different sectors, different attackers, and very different root causes – but the same end result: user data escaping through analytics tools, ancillary systems, and ransomware-ridden networks, even as companies rush to reassure customers that the most sensitive details stayed put. ®

            <div id="article-text">Old data centers physically cannot support rows and rows of GPUs, which is one reason for the massive AI data center buildout.

Old data centers physically cannot support rows and rows of GPUs, which is one reason for the massive AI data center buildout.

In the span of a decade and a half, from 2010 to the end of 2024, the number of data centers in the US quadrupled. The trend is similar worldwide: more data centers, bigger, now or soon. The number of the construction projects of centers over 100 megawatts announced over the last four years total 377, according to data center certification and research agency Uptime Institute.

But before we allow Big Tech’s feverish race toward more compute, which environmentalists would not like us to allow, let us pause and consider another option: making do with what we have. Can we retrofit our current data centers to match the needs of our newest technology? Perhaps the building frenzy is not merited; perhaps we have all the facilities we need. A few upgrades here, some fresh servers over there, a new lick of paint, and voilà — an AI data center built from the shell of a legacy one.

“Most of the time what it’s going to mean is bulldozing the building and starting over from scratch.”

I took this idea to data center experts, who told me, in so many words, that no, our current data centers cannot readily be retrofitted to become AI superhouses. The problem is as physical as the ground you’re standing on: Legacy data centers cannot bear the weight of the latest AI technology. The racks that house computer chips or AI chips are simply too damn heavy for the floors, and they would crack under the weight.

Chris Brown, chief technical officer at Uptime Institute, summarized the situation: “We can retrofit the old ones to an extent, but not to the extent that a lot of these AI factories need.” Small sections of small data centers can accommodate small AI-focused workloads for a single Fortune 500 company, for example, he said. “But most of the time what it’s going to mean is bulldozing the building and starting over from scratch,” Brown said.

AI racks, the metal cabinets that house stacks of metal boxes called servers, which house the chips that do the computer or generative AI processing, have a weight problem. Thirty years ago, at the start of Brown’s career in data centers, racks averaged around 400 to 600 pounds. Think of the weight of a home refrigerator up to a baby grand piano. Now, it’s normal for racks to weigh 1,250 pounds to up to 2,500 pounds, falling in the range of a grizzly bear up to a Toyota Prius. But racks specialized with AI equipment fall to the upper end of the spectrum and beyond — Brown said the projected milestone weight of an AI rack is 5,000 pounds.

The extra weight, Brown said, is due to the amount of electronics crammed into the metal racks. Gaps between GPUs slow data transmission, which slows AI model training, which wastes precious compute power and, ultimately, money. The latest high-density racks come packed with memory chips (leading to the decline of the global supply of RAM) and hundreds up to 1,000 GPUs. Whereas traditional computer chip workloads of a decade ago averaged around 10 kilowatts per rack, AI workloads are now 35 times that, up to 350 kilowatts per rack. “They’re packing as much as they can into each rack and putting racks as close together as humanly possible to maximize that capability,” he said.

More power generates more heat that needs to dissipate before a fire breaks out or the chips melt. Air blown over chips has been replaced or supplemented with cooling plates full of liquid, often a watery mixture of toxic coolants. Water weighs a little over 8 pounds per gallon. And don’t forget about the cables. There are often 10 to 35 racks lined up to form a single row in the bowels of a data center. In order to deliver enough power, the diameter of the cables, or a cable-like copper plate called a busway, needs to increase. (Imagine putting out a house fire with a kitchen sink faucet; better to spray water from a fire hose with its wide diameter.) Brown said that a modern busway weighs 37 pounds per linear foot.

“It’s all those things — it’s the weight of all the processors, all the memory, all of the chips that you need to be able to run the IT devices, all of the cooling hardware that you need inside of there,” he said. The structure of legacy data centers is not up to the task, Brown said. Many have raised floors, which top out at around 1,250 pounds per square foot for a static load, he noted. Dynamic loads, he said, such as a rack pushed across the floor, require higher weight bearing.

Even if you did reinforce the floor of an old center, other geometric problems persist, Chris McLean, president of data center construction firm Critical Facility Group, told The Verge. He has been designing data centers for nearly two decades, and the height of racks has grown by 3 feet during that time, from 6 feet to 9 feet. (The footprint has only increased from 2 by 2 feet to 2 by 3 feet.) The new height stands taller than industrial doorframes from a few years ago. Freight elevators, too, cannot withstand the weight of the gigantic racks, the apparatus on which they rest during moving, and the weight of the humans pushing the thing: “All of a sudden, you’re getting into a pretty beefy elevator for a multi-story,” McLean said.

“What’s caused the huge growth in the last two years is just the fact that artificial intelligence is gobbling up everything.”

Big Tech companies are obviously building new data centers to accommodate their increasing push for AI dominance. And when OpenAI, Microsoft, or others run out of space in their own AI-built data center complexes, they rent space at colocation facilities owned by companies like CoreWeave or Digital Realty or Compass, which are, in turn, building new AI-focused data centers. “What’s caused the huge growth in the last two years is just the fact that artificial intelligence is gobbling up everything,” Brown at Uptime said.

Despite the hype, generative AI is not the only type of computation, lest we forget that typical computer workloads still exist. Actually, non-AI data workloads are actually increasing, Brown said. Traditional data centers, therefore, are as important as ever before. Universities, hospitals, midsize companies, and municipalities will all need to continue to store their non-AI data files, just as you still have your blurry photos housed on some cloud provider’s server, McLean said. “All those people still need that legacy data center environment,” he said. “It’s never going to go away.”

            <div id="article-text">Anthony Enzor-DeMeo says he thinks there’s room for another browser, even an AI browser — as long as you can trust it.

Anthony Enzor-DeMeo says he thinks there’s room for another browser, even an AI browser — as long as you can trust it.

Mozilla is in a tricky position. It contains both a nonprofit organization dedicated to making the internet a better place for everyone, and a for-profit arm dedicated to, you know, making money. In the best of times, these things feed each other: The company makes great products that advance its goals for the web, and the nonprofit gets to both advocate for a better web and show people what it looks like. But these are not the best of times. Mozilla has spent the last couple of years implementing layoffs and restructuring, attempting to explain how it can fight for privacy and openness when Google pays most of its bills, while trying to find its place in an increasingly frothy AI landscape.

Fun times to be the new Mozilla CEO, right? But when I put all that to Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, the company’s just-announced chief executive, he swears he sees opportunity in all the upheaval. “I think what’s actually needed now is a technology company that people can trust,” Enzor-DeMeo says. “What I’ve seen with AI is an erosion of trust.”

Mozilla is not going to train its own giant LLM anytime soon. But there’s still an AI Mode coming to Firefox next year, which Enzor-DeMeo says will offer users their choice of model and product, all in a browser they can understand and from a company they can trust. “We’re not incentivized to push one model or the other,” he says. “So we’re going to try to go to market with multiple models.” Some will be open-source models available to anyone. Others will be private, “Mozilla-hosted cloud options,” he says. And, yes, some will be from the big companies in the space — Enzor-DeMeo didn’t name Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT, but it’s not hard to guess.

Enzor-DeMeo has been at Mozilla for almost exactly a year. Until now, he’s been leading the team building Mozilla’s Firefox browser, which, in so many ways, is the thing that makes Mozilla go. Firefox is the company’s most visible product; it’s the biggest moneymaker, thanks mostly to a deal that gives Google default search placement; and it’s the place where Mozilla gets to actually put its values to work. Enzor-DeMeo spent 2025 racing to make Firefox a more compelling product, adding things like tab groups, while also trying to figure out how the browser should integrate with AI.

As he takes over the top job, Enzor-DeMeo knows that AI is the question at hand. The rise of ChatGPT and its ilk has shaken up product markets everywhere, and the tech industry is betting that as AI takes over, people will be unusually willing to try new products. A lot of companies are even betting that the browser wars are back, after nearly two decades of everybody just using Google Chrome. Enzor-DeMeo buys the theory, and says Firefox’s numbers reflect it — 200 million people use the product every month, he says, and it’s actually growing at a decent clip on mobile in particular. That’s a far cry from the 4 billion or so that use Chrome, but it still gives Firefox meaningful scale.

“Priority one is still building the best browser”

It’s no accident that the Firefox guy is taking over, by the way. “Priority one [for Mozilla] is still building the best browser,” he says. “I am very pragmatic that that is our core business, and it would take a lot to prove otherwise.” Going forward, when Mozilla launches new products, they’re likely to be tied to Firefox – Enzor-DeMeo mentions that Mozilla VPN is coming to Firefox next year, just to name one, and says there are other features in the works.

In our conversation, Enzor-DeMeo returns often to two things: that Mozilla cares about and wants to preserve the open web, and that the open web needs new business models. Mozilla’s ad business is important and growing, he says, and he worries “about things going behind paywalls, becoming more closed off.” He says the internet’s content business isn’t exactly his fight, but that Mozilla believes in the value of an open and free (and thus ad-supported) web.

At some point, though, Enzor-DeMeo will have to tend to Mozilla’s own business. “I do think we need revenue diversification away from Google,” he says, “but I don’t necessarily believe we need revenue diversification away from the browser.” It seems he thinks a combination of subscription revenue, advertising, and maybe a few search and AI placement deals can get that done. He’s also bullish that things like built-in VPN and a privacy service called Monitor can get more people to pay for their browser. He says he could begin to block ad blockers in Firefox and estimates that’d bring in another $150 million, but he doesn’t want to do that. It feels off-mission.

One way to solve many of these problems is to get a lot more people using Firefox. And Enzor-DeMeo is convinced Mozilla can get there, that people want what the company is selling. “There is something to be said about, when I have a Mozilla product, I always know my data is in my control. I can turn the thing off, and they’re not going to do anything sketchy. I think that is needed in the market, and that’s what I hope to do.”

﻿The solar industry is pivoting to survive Donald Trump’s attacks on clean energy.

Ed Murray has been in the solar business long enough to remember the bloodbath of 1985. That’s when President Ronald Reagan ended Jimmy Carter-era solar tax credits meant to decrease US reliance on fossil fuels following the 1970s oil crisis.

“It was a sad time,” says Murray, who is president of the trade group California Solar & Storage Association. Membership to the organization (which hadn’t yet added “storage” to its name) fell from 670 companies to just 37 “almost overnight,” Murray says, as hundreds of businesses went under without the tax credit. “I hope that that doesn’t happen to us again.” (Then-California Gov. George Deukmejian also cut a state tax credit for solar around the same time.)

The industry has managed to make a remarkable comeback since then, thanks in no small part to Congress reinstating a federal solar tax credit in 2005. Speeding the adoption of renewables like solar was meant to limit Americans’ dependence on foreign energy sources. “By developing these innovative technologies, we can keep the lights running while protecting the environment and using energy produced right here at home,” President George W. Bush, a Republican, said upon signing the measure into law.

“I hope that that doesn’t happen to us again.”

Now, as a result of Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax credit is set to expire at the end of 2025, and home solar companies face another cliff. Installers are racing to complete projects for customers wanting to take advantage of the tax credit while they still can, even as they face some major headwinds in the process. After that, the industry will have to figure out how to adapt to a very different solar landscape in the coming year.

“It’s a mad rush and it’s crazy,” Murray says.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this; solar companies and their customers thought they’d have the credit for much longer. The 2005 Energy Policy Act reestablished a solar federal tax credit in the US, which the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) expanded and extended until 2035. That gave a residential solar customer an income tax credit equal to 30 percent of the cost of installation.

This year, the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the IRA, which was the Biden administration’s signature climate and clean energy bill, as part of President Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda. The Republican-controlled Congress voted in July to wind down the home solar tax credit by the end of the year.

Initially, that led to a spike in customers rushing to install home solar systems before the tax credit goes away. EnergySage, a nationwide solar marketplace in the US, says it saw a 205 percent year-over-year increase in homeowners communicating with installers on their platform after the Republican spending bill passed in July. That trend was echoed by Murray, who is also president of the Northern California-based company Aztec Solar, and other installers The Verge contacted. “It increased sales immensely, and so we have a rush to the end,” Murray says.

The surge in demand, however, has also come with bigger headaches for solar companies who say they now have to work with local permitting offices and utilities similarly scrambling to keep up with the sudden onslaught of installation applications. The lead time to secure a permit has doubled since August to about four to eight weeks for Northern California company Vital Energy Solutions, according to its director of sales and marketing, Kevin McGuire.

“It’s no secret that these permitting offices are just totally overwhelmed because of the flood of customers that are just clamoring to get their systems installed before December 31st,” says McGuire, describing a packed city office in Napa that’s otherwise typically pretty quick to process permits.

California is the biggest solar market in the US, but it’s not the only state where there are delays. Slow permitting processes across the nation have been the “biggest barrier” to reaching an industry-wide goal of driving costs down to about $2 a watt, according to EnergySage director of insights Emily Walker. Long wait times increase overhead costs for companies, turn off customers, and now even jeopardize their ability to qualify for the federal tax credit this year.

Vital Energy Solutions sent out a press release in December saying that 120 of its customers in a single congressional district are at risk of losing the tax credit “through no fault of their own” as installers face delays, and calling on policymakers to grant an extension on the end-of-year deadline. Home project costs can range from $15,000 to $50,000 depending on whether they include batteries, according to Murray, and average about $37,000 according to McGuire — so customers stand to lose thousands of dollars by missing out on the 30 percent tax credit.

“Every step of the process is overextended,” Vital Energy Solutions CEO Jason Jackson, whose father started the company in 1971, says in the release. That includes longer wait times with utilities and supply chain snafus, the company adds.

Southern California Edison has had “significant delays” installing meter socket adapters needed to connect utility meters to solar and battery components between September and November as a result of the recent uptick in applications, Bloomberg reports.

Rising costs and holdups in procuring key equipment including solar panels themselves — exacerbated this year by Trump’s tariff regime — have been another hindrance according to some installers. Vital Energy Solutions has had to resort to scouring local hardware stores for basic electrical fittings as its distributors face shortages, only to find store shelves empty.

Two major solar panel suppliers have also had a tumultuous year. In November, manufacturer QCells furloughed 1,000 workers in Georgia after months of shipments detained by US Customs. Solar components have been under increased scrutiny at ports due to policies barring components suspected of being linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang province in China. And a fire at manufacturer REC’s Singapore factory in June backed up deliveries to the US.

Virginia-based Ipsun Solar had to redesign and re-permit projects for customers unable to get the REC components they originally planned to use, according to Leon Keshishian, CEO of Ipsun’s parent company, Civic Renewables. The timing couldn’t have been worse. Ipsun saw a fourfold increase in customers since June as news began to spread that Republicans would soon end the home solar tax credit. “We had to kind of turn off new sales at a point because we just didn’t think we’d get them all billed,” Keshishian says. The company is offering to cover the loss of the tax credit for qualifying customers whose projects it couldn’t install before the end of the year due to unforeseen delays, according to Keshishian.

To survive the loss of the tax credit, installers are figuring out how to diversify or lean into other parts of their business. Some are considering offering roofing and HVAC services, or installing heat pumps and EV chargers. Murray and McGuire’s companies both do commercial installations, which they can lean into since those projects are eligible for a commercial tax credit available until 2028. They expect smaller installers, mom-and-pop shops, to face a harder road ahead.

“There’s going to be a lot of people that, when the music stops, they’re not going to have a place to sit,” McGuire says. “Those companies will either get absorbed into other companies, or they’ll go out of business.”

Even so, no one The Verge spoke to is sounding a death knell for the residential solar industry. They expect that rising electricity rates, particularly in communities near new data centers, will still drive demand for home solar systems that can cut down utility bills in the long run. More frequent power outages during extreme weather and explosive wildfire seasons are also increasing demand for residential systems with batteries that can keep a home’s lights on during a larger blackout.

Industry leaders have also come to expect wild swings from shifting regulatory landscapes and have seen the industry pivot in response. This time around, they even see some solar companies benefitting from the loss of tax credits — those that offer “third-party ownership” (TPO) in industry speak. That could be through leasing, or power purchase agreements (PPA) that allow customers to pay per kilowatt hour for solar power from a system the third party owns.

Over the years, the pendulum has swung between customers preferring to purchase solar panels or lease them. “Now it’s going to swing very strongly in the lease direction,” says Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association. That’s because the Republican spending bill preserved the solar tax credit for commercial projects for longer and allows third-party ownership to qualify.

Sunrun, a solar company that offers power purchase agreements through subscription plans, managed to successfully lobby for those protections in the bill — arguing that their fleet of solar and battery systems served as a distributed power plant that would help stabilize the power grids as they try to meet the nation’s rising electricity demands. (Republicans also faced flak for slashing tax credits that benefited developers in red states.) Sunrun’s stock is now up about 75 percent year over year.

“Having these as an option is a silver lining.”

“While we do think the industry as a whole will shrink a little bit next year, we foresee Sunrun picking up more market share,” Sunrun president and chief revenue officer Paul Dickson tells The Verge.

Keshishian also expects Ipsun — which installs panels for customers who either purchase or lease their systems — “will absolutely sell more TPOs next year.” Prior to his current venture, he was a vice president at SolarCity, which focused on leasing and PPAs before being acquired by Tesla in 2016.

One of the arguments in favor of third-party ownership is that it can potentially allow customers who might not be able to afford to purchase their own home setup to go solar. But PPAs have also gotten a bad rap for escalating rates that could wind up costing customers more each year — in some cases outpacing inflation for electricity.

The loss of the federal tax credit, however, is driving the creation of new third-party ownership options with lower rate escalators, as well as some lease-to-own models. “Having these as an option is a silver lining,” says EnergySage’s Emily Walker — even though the bill that cut clean energy tax credits “is pretty negative by and large for the solar industry.”

Ed Murray’s advice to other installers after surviving the loss of the tax credit in 1985? “Save your money,” he tells The Verge. “And hopefully we have a regime change with the midterm and we get some kind of tax credit back. It’s a tough business.”</div>

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country’s defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.

The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.

US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data.

But another approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment.

Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it’s difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK’s Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation & Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour.

“If you’re guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you’re in an airliner, that’s definitely not good enough.”

A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.

Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle’s bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it’s traveled. Infleqtion&#39;s sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they’re measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret.

Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.

Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine.

“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips.

Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle.

Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond’s location, making it possible to infer where it’s situated on the globe.

Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location.

The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.”

Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors’ functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there’s 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.”

After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane’s location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring.

In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its &quot;software-ruggedized&quot; mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer.

“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”

Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year.

Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade.

US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.

Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX’s internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,” says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”

Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says.

The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it’s an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it’s stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2025-12-11</strong></p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
