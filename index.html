            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world has crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than in the years before.

The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China.

A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

John Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts that laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in the ocean. (Some other calculations he’s done include equating this number to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools, or more than 200 times the electrical use of everyone on the planet.)

“Last year was a bonkers, crazy warming year—that’s the technical term,” Abraham joked to me. “The peer-reviewed scientific term is ‘bonkers’.”

The world’s oceans are its largest heat sink, absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess warming that is trapped in the atmosphere. While some of the excess heat warms the ocean’s surface, it also slowly travels further down into deeper parts of the ocean, aided by circulation and currents.

Global temperature calculations—like the ones used to determine the hottest years on record—usually only capture measurements taken at the ocean’s surface. (The study finds that overall sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than they were in 2024, which is on record as the hottest year since modern records began. Some meteorological phenomena, like El Niño events, can also raise sea surface temperatures in certain regions, which can cause the overall ocean to absorb slightly less heat in a given year. This helps to explain why there was such a big jump in added ocean heat content between 2025, which developed a weak La Niña at the end of the year, and 2024, which came at the end of a strong El Niño year.) While sea surface temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, thanks to our use of fossil fuels, these measurements don’t provide a full picture of how climate change is affecting the oceans.

“If the whole world was covered by a shallow ocean that was only a couple feet deep, it would warm up more or less at the same speed as the land,” says Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and a co-author of the study. “But because so much of that heat is going down in the deep ocean, we see generally slower warming of sea surface temperatures [than those on land].”

Surface temperatures, Hausfather says, are what most directly impact human societies: They have direct effects on weather patterns and most of the ocean life we interact with. But the amount of heat stored in deeper parts of the ocean is a key metric for understanding how climate change is affecting the planet.

“Ocean heat content is in many ways the most reliable thermostat of the planet,” he says. “That’s where all the heat is going—and that’s the reason why almost every year we set a new record for ocean heat content, because there’s so much heat being absorbed by the ocean.”

The estimates of ocean heating in the paper were created using a mix of mathematical models of ocean warming as well as reams of data on ocean temperatures collected from sites around the world. Humans have been tracking ocean temperatures for a long time; Benjamin Franklin recorded sea temperatures during his transatlantic voyages. In the 1870s, the HMS Challenger expedition—which is largely credited with inventing modern oceanography—took measurements at deeper depths. But regularly measuring temperatures substantially below the surface is a relatively new phenomenon. The study’s earliest data goes back to the 1960s, when some navies began taking measurements of deeper ocean temperatures.

A key tool that revolutionized our understanding of deeper ocean temperatures is the international network of Argo floats, with more than 3,500 robotic buoys that were first deployed in the early 2000s to collect data on oceans around the world. In addition to the Argo floats, the study pulls data from a variety of other sources, including data measured from buoys, ship hulls, satellites—and animals. (“We actually put instruments on mammals that swim under ice, and so we can measure temperatures while they swim,” Abraham says. “They can take measurements where our robots can’t go.”) The study also uses algorithmic models trained on particular sets of ocean data.

“It’s really quite impressive that they get such consistent results using multiple datasets,” says Raphael Kudela, a professor of ocean science at UC Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study. Kudela says that studies like these help to hammer home just how much climate change is altering the planet.

“What people often don’t grasp is that it’s taken 100 years to get the oceans that warm at depth,” he says. “Even if we stopped using fossil fuels today, it’s going to take hundreds of years for that to circulate through the ocean. We’re going to pay this cost for a very, very long time, because we’ve already put the heat in the ocean.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the future of free speech on the internet—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on porn sites that operate within the state.

Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens.

Musselman did not respond to a request for comment.

A new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. Other states have flirted with the idea of a porn tax in the past. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump’s first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

Although efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality of such laws is up for debate.

“This kind of porn tax is blatantly unconstitutional,” says Evelyn Douek, an associate professor of law at Stanford Law School. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn’t like it—that’s exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.”

Utah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it’s the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah’s earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. The position—dubbed the “porn czar”—was terminated in 2017.

“Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. “We have seen several states and countries try to impose platform-level age verification requirements, and they have all failed to adequately protect children.” To comply with the new age gate mandates, Pornhub has currently blocked access to users in 23 states.

Critics argue that age verification has never been about protecting children but rather scrubbing porn from the internet. A video leaked in 2024 by the Centre for Climate Reporting showed Russell Vought, a Trump ally and Project 2025 coauthor, calling age verification laws a “back door” tactic to a federal porn ban.

Sites like OnlyFans and Pornhub have brought platform-dependent sex work into the mainstream, but they have also made it easier to police adult entertainers and consumers. As more states begin to implement added tariffs on sex work, creators will bear the brunt of the new laws more than anyone.

The skewed ideology of cultural conservatism that is taking shape under Trump 2.0 wants to punish sexual expression, says Mike Stabile, director of public policy at the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult industry in the US. “When we talk about free speech, we generally mean the freedom to speak, the ability to speak freely without government interference. But in this case, free also means not having to pay for the right to do so. A government tax on speech limits that right to those who can afford it.”

According to company policy, OnlyFans complies with all tax requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Creators are responsible for their own tax affairs. Pornhub, which is currently blocked in Utah and Alabama, did not respond to a request for comment.

Douek notes that following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold age-verification laws in Texas, states can legally regulate minors’ access to sexually explicit material, “but a porn tax does nothing to limit minors’ access to this speech—it simply makes it more expensive to provide this content to adults.” A 2022 report from Common Sense Media, a youth advocacy nonprofit, found that 73 percent of teens age 13 to 17 have watched adult content online. Today, young people regularly access NSFW content via social media, on platforms like X and Snap. Last year, a survey by the UK’s Office of the Children’s Commissioner reported that 59 percent of minors are being exposed to porn by accident, primarily via social media, up from 38 percent in 2023.

In Alabama, as would be the case with Utah, revenue raised by the tax is being used for behavioral health services, including prevention, treatment, and recovery support for young people.

Alabama state representative Ben Robbins, the bill’s Republican sponsor, said in an interview last year that adult content was “a driver in causing mental health issues” in the state. It’s a common argument among lawmakers pushing for a nationwide porn ban. Some scientific studies suggest that adolescent exposure to porn increases rates of depression, low self-esteem, and normalized violence, but health professionals have never reached a consensus on the matter.

With lawmakers working to reframe the issue around underage harm, Stabile says it’s critical to remember that adult content isn’t different from any other kind of protected speech, noting that content-specific taxes on speech have repeatedly been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional censorship.

“What if a state decided that Covid misinformation was straining state health resources and taxed newsletters who promoted it? What if the federal government decided to require a costly license to start a podcast? What if a state decided to tax a certain newspaper it didn’t like?” he says. “Porn isn’t some magical category of speech separate from movies, streaming services, or other forms of entertainment. Adult businesses already pay taxes on the income they earn, just as every other business does. Taxing them because of imagined harms is not only dangerous to our industry, it sets a dangerous precedent for government power.”

            <h2>SpaceX gets FCC permission to launch another 7,500 Starlink satellites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/spacex-gets-fcc-permission-to-launch-another-7500-starlink-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX today received US permission to launch another 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing its total authorization to 15,000 Gen2 satellites including those previously approved.

“Under this grant, SpaceX is authorized to construct, deploy, and operate an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites, bringing the total to 15,000 satellites worldwide,” the Federal Communications Commission announced today. “This expansion will enable SpaceX to deliver high-speed, low-latency Internet service globally, including enhanced mobile and supplemental coverage from space.”

The FCC gave SpaceX permission for the first set of 7,500 satellites in December 2022. The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to “address concerns about orbital debris and space safety” before approving the full bunch.

The FCC said today’s order allows SpaceX to “upgrade the Gen2 Starlink satellites with advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology,” and “operate across Ku-, Ka-, V-, E-, and W-band frequencies, supporting both Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).” The FCC said it is waiving “obsolete requirements that prevented overlapping beam coverage and enhanced capacity,” and is letting SpaceX “add new orbital shells at altitudes ranging from 340 km to 485 km, optimizing coverage and performance.”

The news follows SpaceX’s announcement of maneuvers that will lower about 4,400 of the company’s existing satellites from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) during 2026. SpaceX said it is making the change to increase space safety as the lower altitudes have less debris that satellites could collide with.

The 2022 authorization for the first 7,500 satellites didn’t include mobile service, but the FCC decided in November 2024 that SpaceX could use those satellites to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) in the US. Starlink’s mobile system provides service to smartphones in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks.

T-Mobile is using Starlink in the US, and the satellite operator has partnerships with carriers overseas. With today’s FCC authorization, Starlink will be able to provide both fixed and mobile service from all 15,000 second-generation satellites.

SpaceX also recently struck a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar, which will give it 50 Mhz of mobile spectrum and reduce its reliance on cellular carriers. SpaceX has been leasing 10 MHz of spectrum from T-Mobile to provide supplemental service in the US.

Starlink is separately planning to launch yet another 15,000 satellites that are designed for mobile service. SpaceX asked the FCC to approve this plan in September 2025, saying the “new system will offer a new generation of MSS connectivity, supporting voice, texting, and high-speed data.”

Starlink requests for FCC authorization often face opposition from other satellite firms, and the application for 15,000 more satellites is no exception. Viasat filed a petition to deny the application on Monday this week.

“This proposed expansion of SpaceX’s operating authority would give it an even greater ability and incentive to foreclose other operators from accessing and using limited orbital and spectrum resources on a competitive basis,” Viasat told the FCC. “At the same time, the proposed operations would generate insurmountable interference risks for other spectrum users and the customers they serve, preclude other operators from accessing and using scarce spectral and orbital resources on an equitable basis, undermine and foreclose competition and innovation, and otherwise harm the public.”

Globalstar also filed a petition to deny, and several other satellite operators raised objections. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has generally been a supporter of SpaceX and Elon Musk, however. Carr alleged that the Biden administration targeted Musk’s companies for “regulatory harassment,” and in his current role as chairman Carr pressured EchoStar into selling the spectrum licenses that SpaceX is now buying.

In today’s press release announcing the latest authorization, Carr said that “the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented satellite broadband capabilities, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took a while, but a consensus has emerged in Europe that the continent’s space industry needs to develop reusable rockets. How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions.

Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.

Now, there’s a proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse. ArianeGroup, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, won a contract from the European Space Agency’s Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) initiative in late 2024.

The origins of the Ariane 6 rocket’s design can be traced back to 2014, when Airbus and Safran unveiled the architecture that finally began flying in 2024. The rocket uses an expendable design, with a cryogenic core stage and two or four strap-on solid rocket boosters, depending on the demands of the particular mission.

At the time, SpaceX had already announced plans to recover and reuse its Falcon 9 boosters. SpaceX recovered the first Falcon 9 booster in 2015, then reused one for the first time in 2017. Officials in Europe were betting against SpaceX’s success and lost. Blue Origin joined SpaceX in successfully landing an orbital-class booster last year, and several Chinese companies are close to replicating the achievement.

Bruno Le Maire, the former French finance minister, said in 2021 that the Ariane 6 was a “bad strategic choice.” More recently, in October of last year, the head of ESA said the continent’s space industry must “catch up” with international competitors like SpaceX and develop a reusable launcher “relatively fast.”

In its submission to ESA’s BEST! initiative, ArianeGroup proposes replacing the Ariane 6 rocket’s solid-fueled side boosters with new liquid-fueled boosters. The boosters would be developed by MaiaSpace, a French subsidiary of ArianeGroup working on its own partially reusable small satellite launcher. MaiaSpace and ArianeGroup would convert the Maia rocket’s methane-fueled booster for use on the Ariane 6.

ArianeGroup’s proposal was first reported by European Spaceflight, which said the concept presented to ESA is similar to an ArianeGroup proposal from 2022, when the company described the liquid reusable boosters as a “plug-and-play” alternative to Ariane 6’s solid-fueled boosters, helping reduce operating costs and increase launch rates.

The details of ArianeGroup’s newest proposal have not been published, but the concept was summarized in a paper presented at the European Conference for Aeronautics and Space Sciences in 2025.

Isar Aerospace, a German rocket startup, won a separate BEST! contract from ESA to study a demonstrator for a reusable first stage based on the company’s light-class Spectrum rocket. The Spectrum rocket’s initial design is expendable. Its first test flight last year ended in failure, and Isar is readying the second Spectrum rocket for another launch attempt later this month.

ESA asked ArianeGroup and Isar Aerospace to assess the feasibility of their proposals, develop technology and system development plans, and define plans and costs for a “major flight demonstration.”

MaiaSpace’s rocket won’t launch until 2027, at the earliest, and it’s unlikely any decision to use it as the basis for new Ariane 6 boosters will bear fruit until long after Maia flies on its own. Even if ESA and ArianeGroup take this route, the Ariane 6 rocket would still be predominantly expendable.

It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. As a result, the booster would have to rid itself of much more energy when it comes back through the atmosphere. The Ariane 6’s core stage also has just a single engine, whereas SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others use multi-engine designs to better control the rocket’s descent and landing.

The Ariane 6’s payload shroud, used to protect satellites during the first few minutes of launch, is also not reusable. The upper stage is single-use, too. This is a hard problem to solve, but companies like SpaceX and Stoke Space are already working on new rockets with recoverable and reusable upper stages.

Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program.

Introducing the liquid-fueled boosters might also be a way for ArianeGroup to rapidly gain experience in landing and reusing rockets. Each Ariane 6 launch would have multiple boosters, likely two or four, so a single Ariane 6 flight would double or quadruple the flight test data available from just a single booster.

But with this proposal, ArianeGroup is still trying to catch up to where the bleeding edge of the launch industry was 10 or 15 years ago, not where SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others are today, and a far cry from where Europe’s competition in rocketry will be by the time any such an Ariane 6 Franken-rocket could ever reach the launch pad.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October continues to rage, with the state health department reporting Friday that nearly 100 new cases have been identified just in the last three days.

In a regularly scheduled update this afternoon, the health department said 99 cases were identified since Tuesday, bringing the outbreak total to 310 cases. There are currently 200 people in quarantine and nine in isolation. However, the outbreak is expanding so quickly and with so many exposure sites that health officials are struggling to trace cases and identify people at risk.

“An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and the health department’s incident commander for the measles outbreak, said in the announcement. “Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts.”

The outbreak is centered in the northwestern corner of the state, with cases concentrated in Spartanburg County. According to state data, in the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of students in the county were fully vaccinated. That’s well below the target of 95 percent vaccination coverage that prevents vaccine-preventable infections from spreading. However, the county-wide vaccination rate likely obscures pockets where vaccination rates are even lower, making the virus more likely to spread.

Measles is considered one of the most infectious diseases known to humans. It spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has been present. In an exposure event, up to 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated will become infected.

The disease usually develops seven to 14 days after an exposure, but it can take up to 21 days (which is the length of quarantine). Once it develops, it’s marked by a high fever and a telltale rash that starts on the head and spreads downward. People are contagious for four days before the rash develops and four days after it appears. Complications can range from ear infections and diarrhea to encephalitis (swelling of the brain), pneumonia, death in up to 3 out of 1,000 children, and, in very rare cases, a fatal neurological condition that can develop seven to 10 years after the acute infection (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).

Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is considered 97 percent effective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. Ninety-nine percent of the 310 cases in the South Carolina outbreak are in people who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status (only 2 people were vaccinated).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which only has data as of January 6, has tallied three confirmed cases for this year (two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina, linked to the South Carolina outbreak). Since then, South Carolina reported 26 cases on Tuesday and 99 today, totaling 125. North Carolina also reported three additional cases Tuesday, again linked to the South Carolina outbreak. In all, that brings the US tally to at least 131 just nine days into the year.

In 2025, the country recorded 2,144 confirmed cases, the most cases seen since 1991. Three people died, including two otherwise-healthy children. In 2000, the US declared measles eliminated, meaning that it was no longer continuously circulating within the country. With ongoing outbreaks, including the one in South Carolina, the country’s elimination status is at risk.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a big business. While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.

You’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.

According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”

The conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, illustrates the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend. Sullivan notes that he has consulted engineers at Google before making this proclamation. Apparently, the best way to rank on Google continues to be creating content for humans rather than machines. That ensures long-term search exposure, because the behavior of human beings—what they choose to click on—is an important signal for Google.

Google only provides general SEO recommendations, leaving the Internet’s SEO experts to cast bones and read tea leaves to gauge how the search algorithm works. This approach has borne fruit in the past, but not every SEO suggestion is a hit.

The tumultuous current state of the Internet, defined by inconsistent traffic and rapidly expanding use of AI, may entice struggling publishers to try more SEO snake oil like content chunking. When traffic is scarce, people will watch for any uptick and attribute that to the changes they have made. When the opposite happens, well, it’s just a bad day.

The new content superstition may appear to work at first, but at best, that’s an artifact of Google’s current quirks—the company isn’t building LLMs to like split-up content. Sullivan admits there may be “edge cases” where content chunking appears to work.

“Great. That’s what’s happening now, but tomorrow the systems may change,” he said. “You’ve made all these things that you did specifically for a ranking system, not for a human being because you were trying to be more successful in the ranking system, not staying focused on the human being. And then the systems improve, probably the way the systems always try to improve, to reward content written for humans. All that stuff that you did to please this LLM system that may or may not have worked, may not carry through for the long term.”

We probably won’t see chunking go away as long as publishers can point to a positive effect. However, Google seems to feel that chopping up content for LLMs is not a viable future for SEO.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cosmetic surgeons have turned to using a “fat filler” harvested from dead people in order to give patients new breasts, sexier buttocks and other body contouring tweaks, according to reporting by Business Insider — in a practice that not even “Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley could have dreamed up in her day.

The hot new product in question is called alloClae, manufactured by biomedical science business Tiger Aesthetics, and it’s become increasingly popular in plastic surgery circles despite its gruesome origins and aggressive price tag — ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per procedure, according to BI — because it allows dramatically less healing time and doesn’t require patients being put under general anesthesia.

“People are paying for the convenience,” New York City plastic surgeon Sachin Shridharani told the site.

Historically, plastic surgeons have relied on implants or siphoning fat from another section of your body and injecting it into another part in order to perform body contouring. Using alloClae gives them a flexible new option.

Another reason why it’s become popular is that weight loss GLP-1 agonists drugs like Ozempic have made faces and bodies saggy — and that has them clamoring for specialists like Shridharani to fix their body issues.

“In their own words, ‘I’ve got no ass,&#39;” Shridharani said. “‘My trousers look like they’re falling off.&#39;”

So how does somebody’s fat end up in a plastic surgeon’s syringe?

What typically happens is that people donate their bodies to science, with organs going to donation or scientific research. Tissue banks also harvest fat calls from dead people’s abdomen’s, though, and Tiger Aesthetics buys it and processes the fat cells into alloClae.

“As of the beginning of 2026, we’ll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that’s out there,” Tiger Aesthetics preident Caroline Van Hove told BI.

The practice isn’t entirely unprecedented. There’s already a product called Renuva, for instance, with the same origin but used for facial injections.

Is it weird to have your body sculpted with the fat from a dead person? Maybe, but you clearly can’t argue with results — or the horror of body issues.

            <h2>Red Hot Christmas Toy Crashes So Badly That Kids Can’t Actually Use It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Parents were left scrambling on Christmas day after the hot toy of the season appeared to crash and burn, in a perfect cautionary tale about the era of connected gadgets that can easily brick if their delicate infrastructure is put under strain.

The toy, called the Tin Can, is basically a stripped down landline phone that places calls over WiFi. The devices are styled after colorful tin cans — like an old school tin can telephone, an archaic toy so thoroughly ancient that kids today presumably have no idea it ever existed — with twirly cords just like the landlines of yore.

The pitch is that the Tin Can allows parents to set up a sort of closed network of other Tin Can users, making it a nice compromise for kids who are too young for a cell phone, but who still want to communicate with their friends and family members. It’s free to call other Tin Can users, or parents can pay a $10 monthly subscription to make outside calls.

Yet when kids rushed to phone their friends over the holidays to schedule playdates and sledding runs, they found the string had been cut.

“Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people’s abilities to set up their devices or make calls,” Tin Can’s founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider in an interview. “Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn’t get it all right.”

“It worked great, the kids were using it,” Maria Pahuja, a parent from Virginia, told the publication. “Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working. Sometimes you’d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn’t.”

In other words, kids probably would have had a better chance of connecting with their friends with an actual tin can telephone, operated via vibrationson a string, on Christmas morn’.

By now, things seem to be back up and running, though there are still some issues with call quality popping up, BI reports. A January 8th status update on the company’s website — and, tellingly, a banner on the very top of its home page — advises parents that “we’re continuing to see very positive signs of recovery, but we’re still working through some lingering issues.” The company began in Seattle “with a handful of families and has since grown to serve families across more than 30 states,” its site says. BI reports the company has successfully raised $15.5 million since its launch in Autumn of 2024 — resources which apparently weren’t enough to prevent the toys from turning into a corded lump of coal at the exact moment they were supposed to make a great first impression.

            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been watching the intense partisan divide over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minnesota this week, it’s likely felt as though different Americans are living in completely separate realities.

As it turns out, neuroscience might be able to explain why. In a new study whose findings will surprise absolutely no one who’s endured a fiery holiday dinner debate, researchers discovered that conservative and liberal brains don’t just arrive at fundamentally different conclusions, but take strikingly different paths to get there. It’s a fascinating piece of research which just might explain something about the yawning political divides currently tearing society apart.

The study, published in the journal PLOS One, explored why people rely on different types of evidence when explaining why things happen. Specifically, the paper’s authors at the University of Idaho sought to find why some people look for tons of high-level statistical information, while others are happy to listen to anecdotes or single authority figures to reach political conclusions.

In order to carry out the study, researchers recruited 583 adults from the US, who each took a political ideology survey as well as a test to measure their level of “cognitive reflection,” which measures the capacity to look past a knee-jerk response and engage in factual analysis.

Each participant was then given a fictional scenario about cash bail, a “pay-to-leave-jail” policy which critics say unjustly punishes the poor.

The participants were told that, out of the top 300 US cities by population, 100 had ended cash bail. They were then asked to evaluate whether the policy was “effective at reducing crime” based on 10 pieces of evidence. Each piece of information was either composed of statistical figures or testimony from political “experts” from groups like the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and the National Rifle Association, in order to measure which type of evidence each one gravitated toward.

Participants had the chance to go through as many bits of evidence as they wanted before they delivered their final analysis to the researchers — though not all took advantage of this. For example, the researchers found that the probability a participant would rely on a single data point for their conclusion rose from about 4 percent for “very liberal” people to over 37 percent for “very conservative” folks.

As the researchers concluded, those on the left “tend to be more likely to consult a comprehensive set of statistical data relative to those on the right.”

Outside of the left-right paradigm, those who scored high on the cognitive reflection test were more likely to compare and contrast all available statistical data to form their conclusions than those who scored lower.

“Importantly, our study shows that two major individual-level variables help to predict what type of ‘evidence seeker’ a given person is: whether or not they are ‘cognitively reflected’ and whether or not they are liberal/conservative,” the study’s lead author and professor of politics and philosophy at the University of Idaho Florian Justwan told PsyPost.

“Indeed, people’s political beliefs influence how they look for information (often without them realizing it),” Justwan continued.

Zooming out, the research adds to a body of work which suggests that left-leaning people have more trust in the scientific method than conservatives. While that isn’t exactly a bombshell revelation, it does paint an interesting picture of how people one both sides of the aisle come to their political conclusions.

Said another way: while the research surely won’t end the culture war bickering at Thanksgiving, it gives us a strong explanation why one person’s “obvious proof” is another person’s fake news — a fundamental rift which, if ever resolved, could completely change the political landscape.

            <h2>War Profiteers Furious After Polymarket Refuses to Pay Out on Venezuelan Invasion Bets</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly a week after US strikes bombarded Venezuela during the kidnapping of its president Nicolás Maduro, betting platform Polymarket is refusing to pay out users who gambled on the invasion of Venezeula.

Polymarket is a controversial prediction market where users can gamble on the outcome of real-world events, like who will win a certain election, or which side will control a certain village in the Ukraine-Russo war by a pre-specified date.

In this particular wager, Polymarket was supposed to pay out if “the United States commences a military offensive intended to establish control over any portion of Venezuela,” a determination to be made by “a consensus of credible sources,” the New York Times reported. To those who wagered on such an outcome, the events of January 3rd were proof positive that an invasion had taken place.

Instead, Polymarket came out with a statement arguing the opposite.

“This market refers to US military operations intended to establish control,” the note declares. “President Trump’s statement that they will ‘run’ Venezuela while referencing ongoing talks with the Venezuelan government does not alone qualify the snatch-and-extract mission to capture Maduro as an invasion.”

Those looking to cash in on the brutal attacks — which have killed at least 100 people so far — weren’t too impressed with the platform’s semantical wit.

“Pretty sure this should be yes after Trump said approximately 20 times in his press conference that the US now controls Venezuela,” groused a bettor with $1,876 wagered on a US invasion of Venezuela by March 31st. “We are going to run the country,” another user exclaimed.

“They think there will be no punishment for all this fraud. They are openly changing the rules and manipulating the market,” one user who bet $123 on the outcome complained. “A major investigation file is being prepared regarding Polymarket by the US Department of Justice. Don’t worry.”

Betting market participants relitigating results they don’t like is quickly becoming a pattern in the sector, with similar debates playing out over Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” pick and Elon Musk’s overly ambitious promises about Tesla’s self-driving taxi program.

Still, the latest incident heaps drama on Venezuela’s role in betting markets; it comes amidst some pretty compelling allegations that an insider with advanced knowledge of the US attack on Venezuela scored over $400,000 betting similar lines. (The alleged insider’s bets won all their bets.)

In this case however, every bettor who thought they were crowdsourcing the truth instead got a time honored lesson: no matter what you’re betting over, the house always wins.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of earthquakes have been detected rattling Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, also known as the Doomsday Glacier — the disintegration of which could send between two and 10 feet of devastating flooding to coastal communities worldwide.

This stunning finding, published in a new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that this gigantic behemoth of ice, which is almost as big as the island of Great Britain, is even more fragile than experts feared — and that world governments’ efforts to stop global warming haven’t been nearly enough.

To keep an eye on its imminent collapse, Australian National University seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm suggests in the paper that a dedicated seismic network be located and maintained on the icy continent to “monitor glacial dynamics, which may evolve abruptly in the coming decades or even years.”

The risk is high; Phạm detected a total of 362 previously unrecognized seismic events between 2010 and 2023, and they mostly occurred in the West Antarctic region, the home of the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier, another big block of ice that’s become visibly smaller over the years due to climate change.

Glacier earthquakes are detected at around magnitude 5 on the Richter scale, and are often associated with iceberg calving in warmer months of the Arctic Circle such as the ones in Greenland. By contrast, the dynamics that drive Antarctic earthquakes are little understood because there is simply isn’t much data on them and they tend to register at a lower magnitude.

To rectify that situation, Phạm developed an algorithm to pick up wave patterns collected by seismic monitors on Antarctica. From this data, he determined that 245 of the 362 earthquakes recorded came from Thwaites Glacier, where he believes they were caused by icebergs calving off into the ocean.

Scientists are deeply concerned about the Thwaites Glacier collapse not only because of the immense amount of water it could displace, but because it acts like an icy plug on the West Antarctic ice shelf that keeps all that ice from sliding into the ocean.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk constructed his personal mythology around a pair of weighty accomplishments: building actual, stable businesses around both rockets and electric cars.

So far, he has yet to accomplish the same thing around his AI business. According to documents obtained by Bloomberg, xAI recorded a net loss of $1.46 billion over the third quarter of 2025. That’s an even worse loss than previous months — in the first quarter of 2025, for example, the company’s net loss was roughly $1 billion, and it’s shredded $7.8 billion in cash over the last year, according to documents obtained by the publication.

It’s in good company. Every major AI company is currently losing money hand over fist on the tech. Like its peers, xAI insists that pattern is temporary; per Bloomberg, its executives told investors in a recent earnings call that the company has the resources to “continue spending aggressively.”

Eventually, they promised, the company will build “self-sufficient AI” that can power Tesla’s Optimus robots. Like xAI, Tesla’s stuttering Optimus program is eons away from ever turning a profit — or even from hitting the market, for that matter.

The financial news comes as xAI announces plans to build yet another massive data center, this time in Southaven, Mississippi. With a price tag of $20 billion, it would be the largest private investment in the state’s history — and like previous xAI data centers in Memphis, Tennessee, it will no doubt be a massive headache for its unfortunate neighbors.

            <h2>Nuclear startups are back in vogue with small reactors, and big challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/nuclear-startups-are-back-in-vogue-with-small-reactors-and-big-challenges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The nuclear industry is in the mist of a renaissance. Old plants are being refurbished, and investors are showering startups with cash. In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups raised $1.1 billion, largely on investor optimism that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled.

Traditional nuclear reactors are massive pieces of infrastructure. The newest reactors built in the U.S. — Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia —  contain tens of thousands of tons of concrete, are powered by fuel assemblies 14 feet tall, and generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity each. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget.

The fresh crop of nuclear startups hopes that by shrinking the reactor, they’ll be able to sidestep both problems. Need more power? Just add more reactors. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs.

The magnitude of that benefit is something experts are still researching, but today’s nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero.

But manufacturing isn’t easy. Just look at Tesla’s experience: The company struggled mightily to profitably produce the Model 3 in large numbers — and it had the benefit of being in the automotive industry, where the U.S. still has significant expertise. U.S. nuclear startups don’t have that advantage.

“I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don’t make in the United States,” Milo Werner, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. “We have to buy them overseas. We’ve forgotten how to make them.”

Werner knows a thing or two about manufacturing. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. Today, in addition to investing at DCVC, Werner has co-founded the NextGen Industry Group, which works to advance the adoption of new technologies in the manufacturing sector.

When companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. One is capital, which is often the biggest constraint since factories aren’t cheap. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn’t pose much of a problem. “They’re awash in capital right now,” she said.

But the nuclear industry isn’t immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “We haven’t really built any industrial facilities in 40 years in the United States,” Werner said. As a result, we’ve lost the muscle memory. “It’s like we’ve been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. It’s not good.”

After decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don’t have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members.

The good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “That is pulling manufacturing in closer to the United States because it allows them to have that cycle of improvement.”

To reap the benefits of mass manufacturing, it’s helpful for startups of all stripes to start small and scale up. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease.

The benefits of mass manufacturing don’t happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Officials from Indonesia and Malaysia have said they are temporarily blocking access to xAI’s chatbot Grok.

These are the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes depicting violence — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)

In a statement shared Saturday with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”

The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.

The New York Times said the Malaysian government announced a similar ban on Sunday.

Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially setting the stage for an investigation.

In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.”

And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.

xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.

In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”

This post has been updated to reflect Malaysia’s ban on Grok.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year.

The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch.

The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.

The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.

The announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.

The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.

Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.

Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business.

“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics.

            <h2>Google announces a new protocol to facilitate commerce using AI agents</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/google-announces-a-new-protocol-to-facilitate-commerce-using-ai-agents/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google today announced a new open standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent-based shopping, at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference.

The standard, developed with companies like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, lets agents work across different parts of customer buying processes, including discovery and post-purchase support. The core idea is that the standard could facilitate these various parts of the process instead of requiring connections with different agents.

Google said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (A2P) — which Google announced last year — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The company specified that Agents and Businesses can pick and choose specific extensions of the protocol that suits their needs.

The company said that it will soon use UCP for eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and the Gemini apps to let shoppers check out directly from U.S.-based retailers while researching a product. Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option.

“This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. “It’s really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.”

Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow.

In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I’m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment.

The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are also working on having sellers be more discoverable in AI chatbot results. Startups like the prompting company are also working with merchants to have their products surface within AI answers.

Google is now also allowing merchants to integrate an AI-powered Business Agent within their websites to answer customer questions. The company noted that merchants like Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, and Reebok are already using this product. Competitors like Meta and Shopify have been exploring AI-powered tools for businesses for customer support and outreach.

The search giant also announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a suite to handle shopping and customer service for retailers and restaurants.

Companies like Google, Amazon, Walmart, and OpenAI have been releasing new standards and products to infuse AI into every bit of shopping, both on the consumer and merchant side. Earlier in the month, Adobe noted that traffic driven to seller sites by generative AI grew by 693.4% during the holiday season, though the report didn’t specify how much of this traffic translated into sales.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it has given SpaceX approval to launch another 7,500 of its second generation Starlink satellites, for a total of 15,000 satellites worldwide.

Beyond simply allowing SpaceX to launch more satellites and expand its high-speed internet coverage, the FCC says its decision also means Starlink satellites can operate across five frequencies and to provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States, along with supplemental coverage in the U.S.

Reuters reports that SpaceX had requested approval for an additional 15,000 satellites, but the FCC said it would “defer authorization of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites.”

SpaceX must launch 50% of the approved Starlink satellites by December 1, 2028, and the remaining 50% by December 2031, the FCC says.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/10/openai-is-reportedly-asking-contractors-to-upload-real-work-from-past-jobs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI and training data company Handshake AI are asking third-party contractors to upload real work that they did in past and current jobs, according to a report in Wired.

This appears to be part of a broader strategy across AI companies that are hiring contractors to generate high-quality training data in the hopes that this will eventually allow their models to automate more white-collar work.

In OpenAI’s case, a company presentation reportedly asks contractors to describe tasks they’ve performed at other jobs and upload examples of “real, on-the-job work” that they’ve “actually done.” These examples can include “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo.”

The company reportedly instructs contractors to delete proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, and it points them to a ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to do so.

Nonetheless, intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown told Wired that any AI lab taking this approach is “putting itself at great risk” with an approach that requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential.”

An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few years ago, I visited my childhood home and heard a surprising sound: the bright and bouncy music of the Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny. My parents are white Baby Boomers who speak no Spanish and have never shown a taste for hip-hop, but they’d somehow gotten into Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, whose sex-and-rum-drenched lyrics they couldn’t begin to decipher. The vector of transmission appeared to be the streaming service hooked to their smart speakers. When in need of a pick-me-up, Mom would shout, “Alexa, play Bad Bunny,” and make her Southern California kitchen sound like a San Juan nightclub.

Stories like this help explain how Bad Bunny has reached across language barriers to dominate pop domestically and abroad. Since uploading his first single in 2016, he’s broken U.S. sales records and claimed the title of the most streamed artist on Spotify in four separate years. His popularity, high standing with critics, and duration of success make him a peer—and sometimes a better-selling one—of such contemporary titans as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Kendrick Lamar. Like them, he’s figured out that 21st-century-pop success is achieved by assembling excitingly hybrid sounds around an iron core of identity. In his case, that means performing almost exclusively in Spanish.

Many Latin American singers have enjoyed cross-over fame before, but none has done it in the way Bad Bunny has, or at the same scale. Before streaming, they couldn’t: Major-market radio DJs, record-label execs, and the media still decided what constituted the American mainstream, and conventional wisdom said that audiences preferred music whose lyrics they could understand. Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias, and Shakira cracked U.S. markets only after they started singing in English. Rare exceptions, such as “Macarena,” by Los del Río, didn’t even confer name recognition upon their creators.

But the internet has revealed popular desires that last century’s gatekeepers didn’t know how to exploit. Bad Bunny arose from a transnational scene—widely called música urbana—whose primary audience is Spanish speakers, including the 44 million who live in the United States. Streaming has also helped English-only audiences connect with his music, just as it has for K-pop and Afrobeat. This month, Bad Bunny will occupy a cultural stage once reserved for America’s classic-rock gods and pop goddesses: the Super Bowl halftime show.

Bad Bunny has touted his game-day gig as a triumph for Latino—particularly Puerto Rican—representation. And in plain ways, his ascendance contradicts Donald Trump’s decree, made last March, that English is the sole national language. MAGA voices attacked the “crazy” decision by the “woke” NFL to book someone who’s not “a unifying entertainer.” They cited Bad Bunny’s political stances (he doesn’t want ICE outside his concerts) and gender-bending fashion (his biceps look great in a minidress). But they also tend to express the view that he, though an American citizen, is somehow un-American. The conservative activist group Turning Point USA is planning an alternative halftime show; in a poll sent to its supporters about what they’d like to see, the first option was “anything in English.”

The truth is that Bad Bunny’s rise is plenty American, and not simply because it reinforces the pluralistic ideals that Trump’s movement seeks to diminish. Bad Bunny’s music has reached all corners of the planet because it is a state-of-the-art product; he is a victor in the ever more crowded race for the freshest and most broadly appealing sound. Language barriers have turned out to be yet another bit of old friction that the internet has sanded down to create a cosmopolitan, commercialized middle ground. Does what’s lost in translation matter?

From the November 2022 issue: Jaquira Díaz on the case for Puerto Rican independence

At the center of Bad Bunny’s sound is the rhythm that has ruled Latin American pop for decades: reggaeton, which marries dancehall and rap in crisp, minimalist fashion. Inspiring partying often with just a drum machine and a vocalist, reggaeton first flourished as the sound of working-class urban life in Puerto Rico. “This is where I was born, and so was reggaeton, just so you know,” Bad Bunny boasts in Spanish in one song.

He also grew up as a highly online Millennial at a time when American pop culture was ruled by Fall Out Boy’s pop punk, Lady Gaga’s synth pop, and Drake’s rap blues. All of those touchstones now inform his maximalist take on reggaeton. In any given Bad Bunny song, the melodies roll and sway between emo dejection and childlike glee, the electronic beats call to mind Nintendo games, and the low end churns as ominously as a lava pit. Bad Bunny’s vocal tone is unique: husky and flat, peppered with gasps and grunts, and shimmering with digital effects. He sounds like a ringmaster in a futuristic circus, and you don’t need to know Spanish to feel that a thrilling story is unfolding.

Indeed, Bad Bunny’s success with English-speaking audiences might seem to answer the perennial music-fan debate about how important lyrics really are. Any Rolling Stones listener oblivious to what Mick Jagger is yowling about knows that the art form’s pleasures don’t require intelligibility. And the ideals of enlightened music appreciation dictate that listening to music you don’t understand can be a mind-expanding exercise. As David Byrne once put it, “To restrict your listening to English-language pop is like deciding to eat the same meal for the rest of your life.”

Music, however, is also a form of communication. That’s especially the case in the tradition Bad Bunny builds on: hip-hop, in which narrative, persona, and wordplay are crucial. He raps with intoxicating fluidity, stringing syllables together in a steady murmur that encourages close listening. Translations get you only part of the way to comprehending this aspect of his appeal. His themes are largely the same as those of English-language pop rappers—success, partying, and girls. (Lots of girls: “Me gustan mucho las Gabriela, las Patricia, las Nicole, las Sofía,” goes his smash “Tití Me Preguntó,” a little black book in song form.) But as I read along, I can sense all the things I’m missing: puns, connotations, references.

Even some fluent Spanish speakers may feel similarly. He raps in a Caribbean dialect that is “full of so many skipped consonants, Spanglish, neologisms, and argot that it borders on Creole,” the Puerto Rican anthropology professor Yarimar Bonilla wrote in The New York Times. Bad Bunny’s success proves the cliché that music is a universal language, but it also highlights how universality can shear art from its social context—of which, in this artist’s case, there is a lot.

Bad Bunny has taken care to make his most important messages clear through not only lyrics but also videos, album art, and interviews. He’s more than a Puerto Rican Casanova with an ear for appealing musical pastiche. He’s also a protest artist, and part of what he’s protesting is the very process by which he has become so famous.

The title of his latest album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS (or “I Should Have Taken More Photos”), expresses a sense of loss about the culture he grew up in. The cover image is of two empty chairs against a backdrop of banana trees. The songs long for friends and neighbors who have emigrated. A short film released with the album portrays an old man visiting a San Juan coffee shop only to find that it has been gentrified beyond recognition—filled with tourists and digital nomads scarfing overpriced vegan quesitos. (The video also features a talking toad belonging to an endangered local species.)

Bad Bunny is articulating the surreal and sad feeling of seeing his homeland transformed by internet-supercharged globalization. The U.S. territory’s economy has long relied on tourism, but in recent years, a wave of laptop-toting mainlanders lured by the balmy climate and notoriously loose tax laws has driven rent increases and threatened to wash out the local identity. Bad Bunny’s new album, Bonilla wrote, is a “lament for a Puerto Rico slipping through our fingers: betrayed by its leaders; its neighborhoods displaced for luxury developments; its land sold to outsiders, subdivided by Airbnb and crypto schemes and repackaged as paradise for others.”

Bad Bunny seeks not just to point out the problem of displacement, but also to do something about it. He’s portrayed his refusal to sing in English as a proactive maneuver against the pressures of Anglo-assimilation. On his latest tour, he skipped the continental U.S. entirely, citing fears that ICE agents would target his concerts. Instead, he hosted a 31-show residency in San Juan, the title of which, No me quiero ir de aquí, means “I Don’t Want to Leave Here.” He has campaigned for the island’s independence and against its potential statehood. One song on the new album spotlights Hawaii—a tourist playground whose natives have been utterly marginalized—as an example of the fate that could befall Puerto Rico if its residents do not resist the influence from their north.

Yet, inevitably, Bad Bunny’s worldwide fame is bound up in the same cycle he bemoans. Though many tickets for his concert residency were set aside for locals, the gambit of course attracted outsiders to the island. Some made a pilgrimage to the supermarket where he once worked in his hometown of Vega Baja. One was shot and killed in La Perla, a poor San Juan neighborhood that began to attract tourists only after being featured in the video for Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s 2017 reggaeton smash, “Despacito.”

In this context, Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl booking represents an uneasy trade. He gets to perform on America’s most watched stage—expressing his vision on a grand scale in ways that could energize his fans and expand his audience. The NFL not only gets a popular performer to juice ratings; it gets to advertise itself to the Spanish-speaking world at a time when professional football is eyeing the global market share of soccer and other sports, eager to carve out a niche. Some might say that the NFL is a mainland-American institution with colonial ambitions, and that Bad Bunny is now part of that effort.

Exports, imports, migration, melding—the costs of these historical engines of change and progress are now the preoccupation of popular art and politics. In a strange way, MAGA and Bad Bunny are each responding to versions of the same 21st-century phenomenon: the decoupling of culture and geography, which has left so many people—wherever they were born—feeling strangely placeless and adrift. But the cruel absurdities and dark historical parallels of Trump’s nationalist agenda reflect how perverse, and ultimately futile, strident identity protectionism is in 2026. American country music has been catching on abroad; American listeners have KPop Demon Hunters fever. And the Super Bowl will be headlined by an artist who seems sure he can create something meaningful out of interconnectivity—something that’s his own, no matter how much it’s shared.

            <h2>The Trump Administration’s ‘Magical Thinking’ on Cuba</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-cuba-havana-venezuela-maduro/685579/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In November 1999, Havana’s Latinoamericano stadium sold out for a baseball game that was billed as a friendly rivalry between Latin America’s oldest and newest revolutionary leaders. Hugo Chávez had been Venezuela’s president for fewer than nine months when he took the field opposite Cuba’s Fidel Castro, who had led his country’s revolution 40 years earlier, when Chávez was just 4 years old. The crowd roared “Chávez! Chávez!” as the energetic Venezuelan leader trotted onto the field, dressed in white pinstriped pants and a red-blue-and-yellow windbreaker with white stars across the sleeves—a nod to his country’s flag. Castro, dressed in green slacks, a red cap, and a blue windbreaker emblazoned with the letter C, spent most of the night calling the plays in the manager’s box.

Castro saw Chávez as a loyal protégé, a fellow socialist traveler who shared his dream of creating the united Latin America that Simón Bolívar, known as El Libertador, strived to build as a soldier and statesman in the early 19th century. U.S. sanctions were stifling Cuba, and Castro was still trying to recover from the loss of his country’s top benefactor, the Soviet Union, when it collapsed in 1991. He saw Chávez’s ascendance as a turning point, the baseball game epitomizing the ideological union between Havana and Caracas. The relationship proved so symbiotic that it outlived both Castro and Chávez, surviving decades of geopolitical tumult and hostility from Washington.

Today, that relationship is being tested in new ways. The Trump administration has forecast that the arrest and extradition of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is only the first in a series of dominoes to fall, with Cuba perhaps the most important and symbolically resonant. “We are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on NBC’s Meet the Press the day after Maduro was seized.

“If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned,” he’d earlier told reporters at Mar-a-Lago.

So intertwined are the two Latin American nations that among the roughly 75 people killed by U.S. forces in the Caracas raid, at least 32 were Cubans. They were part of a large cadre working as Maduro’s bodyguards and in Venezuela’s domestic intelligence services to determine “who spies on who inside, to make sure there are no traitors,” Rubio said.

The administration has no plans to conduct any military operation against Cuba akin to its raid on Caracas, U.S. officials told me. (One official, sounding exhausted by recent events, just laughed in response to my question.) For now, those who want to see the Cuban government fall hope that Maduro’s removal will be enough to sink the regime that Castro’s revolution installed in 1959.

Many experts I spoke with are skeptical. Yes, the future looks bleak for the island of 11 million people, who are already suffering from a dismal economy and aggressive state repression. Yes, the regime appears fatigued, having lost the leadership of both Fidel (who died in 2016) and his brother, Raúl, who is 94 and has yielded power to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.

But Cuba has survived many periods of severe hardship over the past six decades, and it remains difficult to discern any real impetus for dramatic change, absent a major U.S. military attack (and the last time Washington tried such a thing, in 1961, it ended in disaster). There is no opposition capable of igniting change from the inside. The intricate barter system that Cuba and Venezuela developed to survive U.S. sanctions may be hard to unwind, especially because the regime in Caracas continues to reign, even without Maduro. Russia and China, though chastened by their inability to protect Venezuela, retain a strong interest in propping up Havana, given Cuba’s location just 90 miles south of Key West. And the oil that Havana depends on from Venezuela can, at least in part, be substituted by supplies from elsewhere.

“I’ve spoken to people in the Department of State, and when they say, ‘This is it, it’s going to collapse,’ my question is, ‘Explain to me how it’s going to collapse?’ And they don’t have an answer for that,” William LeoGrande, a co-author of Back Channel to Cuba, a history of negotiations between Washington and Havana, told me. “They’re engaging in a kind of magical thinking.”

When President Trump talked about Venezuela in the months before Maduro’s capture, he repeated three mantras: We need to hit drug traffickers; we need the oil; and we need Maduro to go. When Trump talks about Cuba, there are fewer particulars. Observers believe his central aim is to appeal to Cuban and Venezuelan Americans, who make up an influential voting bloc in the president’s adopted home of South Florida.

I saw this firsthand at a July 2024 rally in the 100-degree-plus heat near the tenth hole of Trump’s National Doral hotel and golf club in Miami. Over the course of nearly two hours, Trump mentioned Cuba more than a dozen times, eliciting big cheers as he drew parallels between socialism there and the views espoused by his Democratic opponents. “They are turning America into Communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela,” he told the rapturous crowd. He said he would stand with the “people of Cuba in their long quest for justice, liberty, and freedom.” Many people I spoke with had been born in the U.S. but raised by parents or grandparents who’d lost everything to socialism.

Enter Rubio, the former Republican senator from Florida, who was influenced as a child by his Cuban grandfather’s stories about the Cold War. Rubio was a driving force for the overthrow of Maduro and now is the chief intermediary with his successor, former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez.

For Rubio and many other officials from Florida, toppling the Cuban regime represents the ultimate victory of American liberty over Soviet-inspired Latin American repression.

After the military operation in Venezuela, Trump continued to speak about Cuba in terms of domestic politics, and in a manner less belligerent than he uses even when speaking about Greenland, a protectorate of a NATO ally. “We want to help the people in Cuba, but we want to also help the people that were forced out of Cuba and are living in this country,” Trump told reporters after Maduro’s capture, adding, “I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”

For all their connections and shared ideologies, Venezuela and Cuba have very different histories. Venezuela had a vibrant democratic society prior to the rise of Chavismo, the political ideology named for Chávez, who came to power less than 30 years ago. Although the administration has not made restoration of democracy in Venezuela a near-term goal—Trump didn’t mention democracy once during his Mar-a-Lago press conference after the Maduro raid—the country’s former democratic institutions could be restored now that Maduro is out, Trump officials told me. Venezuela was “an imperfect but long-standing democracy” with opposition groups and a civil society, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, a former U.S. diplomat who served in Havana, said. Cuba, meanwhile, has been a one-party Communist state for almost 70 years.

Venezuela also has a vibrant political opposition, which the U.S. worked with to pile pressure on Maduro. Cuba’s opposition? “They don’t even exist anymore,” LeoGrande said. He told me there is “nearly universal discontent” among Cubans with their government over the state of the economy, which has been acutely suffering since the coronavirus pandemic. GDP is at least 10 percent down from pre-COVID levels. But there is no counterweight to the regime that might help change the country’s direction. And many Cubans still appreciate the provision of state-financed health care and education, even if the quality has deteriorated. Should the regime end, Cubans may opt for reform rather than completely abandoning socialist practices.

“Cuba has human resources. They have a good educational system,” Brian Nichols, the State Department’s top Latin America official under President Biden, told me. “They generate a significant number of professionals, but their ability to take advantage of that is largely absent.”

Venezuela is also attractive to Trump because of its oil; the country holds the world’s largest reserves, estimated at 300 billion barrels. Cuba’s offshore reserves are estimated at a fraction of that, between 4.6 billion and 9.3 billion barrels. “Cuba is much less enticing in terms of payoff,” one U.S. official told me, although this morning on Truth Social, Trump said of Havana: “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”

One of the rallying cries of the Cuban Revolution was Patria o Muerte, Venceremos, “Homeland or death, we shall overcome.” Cuba has had to embrace that approach constantly since Castro took power in 1959.

The following year, Cuba seized and nationalized American economic assets, including oil refineries, prompting President Dwight Eisenhower to end U.S. exports, save for food and medicine. His successor, President John F. Kennedy, broadened the embargo to almost all goods and services. Moscow, eager for a Communist beachhead in the Americas, replaced the U.S. as the chief economic sponsor of the Cuban regime, purchasing sugar at subsidized prices and providing oil on credit.

After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion—the covert White House plan to overthrow Castro using 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles—the U.S.S.R. ramped up military aid too, deploying the nuclear missiles that sparked the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.

The Soviet Union’s deterioration in the late 1980s sent Cuba’s economy into a free fall. Havana resorted to extreme austerity, shifted to more sustainable agriculture, introduced market-oriented reforms, and accelerated oil extraction. It also forged a major new alliance across the Caribbean, in Caracas. By 2013, the year Maduro succeeded Chávez, Venezuelan financial aid and oil subsidies accounted for almost one-quarter of Cuba’s national output, though Mexico recently supplanted Venezuela as Cuba’s chief source of oil as U.S. sanctions constricted Venezuela’s ability to do business.

Russia, meanwhile, has revived its Cuban partnership, docking warships and nuclear-powered submarines at Cuban ports for drills, and providing the regime with oil and grain. In return, Cuba has dispatched thousands of mercenaries to bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. Havana also turned to China for military and intelligence cooperation, although both Beijing and Moscow may value their alliances as much for their symbolism, given Cuba’s proximity to the United States. Chinese and Russian support for Cuba “was always designed to poke us more than it was to do anything substantive,” Alexander Gray, who served as a top national-security official during Trump’s first term, told me.

Through the decades, the U.S. has maintained its blockade, now the longest in modern history. Otherwise, Cuba policy has ebbed and flowed. President Ronald Reagan, for instance, named Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1982. President Obama lifted the designation. President Trump, in his first term, restored it. President Biden gave notice in the final days of his presidency that he would rescind it again, but the measure never took effect.

Cuba’s complicated barter system with Venezuela—exchanging oil for thousands of Cuban doctors, teachers, sports trainers, technical advisers, and intelligence operatives—has endured. “What Cuba gave back didn’t have much actual market value,” Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America–energy expert at Rice University, told me. “But politically, it was extremely valuable because the intelligence advisers and political advisers, especially, were key for the sustenance of the regime.”

Foreigners greased the system. Companies in Panama set up by Ramon Carretero, a Panamanian businessman, for example, received contracts worth millions of dollars from Venezuela’s national oil company, Ivan Ruiz, a writer at Transparencia Venezuela en el Exilio, an activist group, told me. In turn, Carretero’s companies made payments to Maduro’s niece and nephew, Ruiz said. (In September, Carretero walked away from the mysterious crash of a plane used by Maduro’s regime for official trips to Cuba, according to local news reports and activists. His whereabouts are unknown; the U.S. slapped sanctions on him in December for facilitating oil payments on behalf of the Venezuelan government.)

On that night nearly 30 years ago at Latinoamericano stadium, Castro and Chávez, beaming and sweaty after the long-awaited game, declared their union unbreakable. Castro awarded Chávez Cuba’s highest honor, the Order of José Martí, named after a 19th-century poet—a leader in Cuba’s movement for independence from Spain.

The teams comprised veteran baseball stars from both nations. But as the game wore on, spectators realized that Castro had disguised some young professional players as bearded, older men to play cleanup in the final innings. The Cubans beat the Venezuelans, 5–4. As another U.S. official told me: “The Cubans always find a way.”</div>

            <h2>The YIMBY Hero Everyone Is Shouting At</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/scott-wiener-yimby-shouted-at/685566/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Scott Wiener has an unusual distinction in American politics: He upsets almost everybody. In the months before I met the California state senator—who is now running for Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat—he had been harangued at one public meeting after another. In October, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted his campaign’s pumpkin-carving event to shout: “Wiener, Wiener, you can’t hide; we charge you with genocide.” (This was not an isolated incident.) His usual response in these situations is to wait calmly and then carry on as normal.

At another event a few days later, the singer Tish Hyman, who identified herself as “the only Black lesbian here,” confronted Wiener about his far-reaching support for transgender inclusion. “What would you say to women who are seeking assurance that their safety will be protected from men who by California law can self-ID as women in women-only spaces?” asked Hyman. Wiener replied that he was committed to the safety of all women—trans women included. Video of the confrontation went viral.

In an era when many politicians try to make only the most cautious public statements, or the ones most palatable to their side of the political spectrum, Wiener is an outlier. As a gay, Jewish politician, he defends Israel in ways that get him in trouble with the left. His LGBTQ advocacy not only has made him a target of the right but also goes too far for people such as Hyman, who voted for Kamala Harris. And as a YIMBY—an acronym that stands for “Yes in My Backyard”—he’s faced down San Francisco’s powerful homeowner class, who wrap their aversion to new housing in the language of environmentalism and social justice. His successful housing legislation has attracted national attention—to get homes built in San Francisco, you have to be something close to a magician. He “works on thorny issues of policy and politics with a wonk’s focus and a jock’s tenacity,” a recent Mother Jones article declared. The New York Times’ Ezra Klein credited him for being, “for a very long time, this lonely voice trying to radically expand housing supply.”

Wiener stands athwart some of the touchiest fault lines in today’s politics, and his extreme tolerance for pushback has made him one of the most effective legislators in the country. He also might be the most shouted-at politician in America. “I have supporters in San Francisco who don’t love my housing work,” Wiener told me, “but they either don’t love it, but they understand why I’m doing it—or they don’t love it, but they tolerate it and they like me because of other issues, right?”

Helen Lewis: The Gaza left and the gender left

Although in other ways you couldn’t imagine two more dissimilar men, Wiener’s ferociously active spirit resembles the Bolshevik antsiness of Donald Trump. The current president is attractive to some voters who might not agree with his values, or his language, or even his policies, but who like that the president is, well, presidenting. Last year, Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House, one of the most recognizable historic sites in the United States. In Democratic cities, people demand 38 meetings and three dozen environmental assessments before tearing down a crack den to build a nursery for sad orphans. Voters, Wiener argues, want politicians who are “willing to break glass to get those things done.”

In any shot of the California legislature, Wiener is instantly recognizable—a 6-foot-7 figure in a crisp suit and tie. He studied law at Harvard, where Ketanji Brown Jackson, now a Supreme Court justice, was a classmate. He moved to San Francisco in the 1990s to take a job with a law firm, where he worked on LGBTQ issues and housing policy. “As a young attorney in the late 1990s, I represented a long-term HIV survivor facing eviction,” he wrote last year. “He told me he could either return to the South for housing and lose access to quality HIV care, or stay in San Francisco for the care he needed but become homeless.”

Wiener has competition for Pelosi’s seat, and the composition of his rivals tells an interesting story about the various currents of the modern Democratic Party. One of his opponents is Saikat Chakrabarti, a 39-year-old start-up centimillionaire who previously served as chief of staff to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Pelosi has not formally endorsed a candidate, but she has appeared at events with another contender, Connie Chan, a progressive member of the city’s Board of Supervisors who is popular with labor unions. Wiener says Chan caters to NIMBYs; her supporters call Wiener a pro-developer capitalist.

The race has now become a proxy for the California housing wars, which pit younger renters against established homeowners in neighborhoods zoned for single-family units. This summer, Wiener finally got so-called infill legislation passed, which permits denser construction near public transportation. Senate Bill 79 was the third version of the bill—the first, S.B. 827, died in committee all the way back in 2018. “When we did S.B. 827, it was like a brand-new thing, like no bill like that, even in the same universe had ever been introduced before,” Wiener told me.

After its failure, Wiener looked for compromises and championed other bills aimed at increasing housing supply. At the same time, pressure groups worked hard to get younger, more YIMBY legislators elected. “Term limits have their downsides,” he told me. “One of the upsides is you have new, fresh thinking on different issues, and this is one of them.” Less high-mindedly, when S.B. 79 ran into resistance in Sacramento, he made a deal—pledging that housing more than 85 feet tall, or on land owned by transit authorities, would use unionized labor. After making such concessions, the bill finally squeaked through.

In the wild seas of California politics, his YIMBYism has drawn attacks from the left. “There are some people in San Francisco, if you believe in making it easier to build things, then that somehow makes you a moderate,” he said. Wiener is often attacked for not being left-wing enough. As a member of the city’s Board of Supervisors, he fought to ban public nudity from the Castro neighborhood outside of Pride parades and other special events. As a result, he was sharply criticized by radical nudists. “The San Francisco labels are stupid,” he told me. He considers himself “very progressive” and is more overtly sex-positive than even the typical Bay Area politician. He has posed shirtless in a leather necktie at the Folsom Street Fair, and spoken publicly about taking Truvada, a pill that dramatically reduces the chances of contracting HIV.

Since October 7, Weiner has clearly found it hard to reconcile his commitment to Israel with the mood among leftists who endorse his support for LGBTQ rights. He is the son of Conservative Jewish parents who founded a congregation near their home in rural Turnersville, New Jersey; he says he was called a “kike” and a “Christ-hater” at school. Both of his nephews were Bar Mitzvah–ed in Israel, and he still has relatives there. “It’s the home of half of all Jews on the planet,” he notes.

Wiener has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “indefensible,” condemned the violence of West Bank settlers, and called for an end to arms sales to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. But he has also argued that Israel has a right to defend itself, and a right to exist as a Jewish state, and he does not characterize the bombing of Gaza as a genocide—a description that the San Francisco left insists upon. Both Chakrabarti and Chan had an easier time with the crowd at the candidates’ first joint appearance, on January 7, because they held up signs saying yes when the moderator asked whether Israel was committing genocide. Wiener declined to answer the question in either direction.

He links these purity tests to medieval tropes that defined “good Jews” as those who quietly obeyed the authorities and “bad Jews” as those who were too open about their identity. Today, he sees Jews being pushed out of progressive circles based on similar judgments. “If part of your Jewishness is, you know, that you support the homeland of the Jews and the home of one-half of all Jews on the planet, then that makes you a bad Jew,” he said. “If you’re not willing to use the exact language that we want you to use, then you’re a bad Jew.”

Wiener told me that since October 7, he has personally—“as a state senator who has no role in foreign policy”—experienced an increase in anti-Semitism. So have other Jewish leaders and businesspeople in San Francisco. “It’s not just about Israel,” he said. “It’s straight-up anti-Semitism.” On December 7, for example, he posted on X about California students who formed a human swastika on school football field, uploading their photo alongside a Hitler quotation about how “international financial Jews” would plunge the world into war, leading to the “annihilation of the Jewish race.”

He is regularly confronted in public by provocateurs with cameras, filming clips for social media. Wiener says he wants to stay open to those who want a genuine conversation, such as a non-Zionist Jewish friend who brought over eight people for a two-hour meeting on the subject. “We had a wonderful dialogue,” he maintains.

Talking with Wiener was my way of stepping outside my own tribe on one set of issues. His transgender-rights advocacy, in my view, ignores serious gaps in the evidence base for youth gender medicine and brushes aside women’s concerns about biological males in their sports and single-sex spaces.

The story of the woman who confronted Wiener, Tish Hyman, is that she felt unsafe changing in front of a transgender woman, Alexis Black, in a gym. Hyman confronted the gym staff, who threw her and Black out; under California law, people can use whichever locker room aligns with their gender identity. After the incident went viral, it emerged that Black, under the name Grant Freeman, had previously pleaded guilty to assault, after breaking her then-wife’s jaw. (Upon transitioning after the attack, Black took the ex-wife’s first name.) Wiener argues that transgender women face violence, too, and should not be treated as an inherent threat. “I think anyone who is harassing anyone or engaging in weird, creepy, inappropriate behavior in a locker room, in a group bathroom, something should be done about that,” Wiener tells me, “whether that is a cis man, cis woman, trans man. That should not be tolerated.” Transgender people who want to get on with their lives without harassment and abuse should not suffer because of the actions of the occasional creep, he says.

The argument isn’t about what policies he supports, he says, because he has never proposed a bill about restrooms or locker rooms specifically. “The triggering thing I said on that stage,” he said, referring to the event where Hyman and others criticized him, “is trans women are women, and they fundamentally dispute that.”

If California Governor Gavin Newsom runs for president, he will have to answer for the state’s many gender-related policies championed by Wiener, such as adding a nonbinary option to driver’s licenses. Wiener also proposed S.B. 357, which repealed California’s law criminalizing loitering with intent to commit prostitution. He has argued that this prevents young people, in many cases members of sexual or racial minorities, from being hassled by police; the Times recently reported that the new approach hampered police attempts to find underage girls working on the streets.

Legislation like this has made Wiener a frequent target of MAGA influencers such as Libs of TikTok. In 2024, an account called “End Wokeness” posted a description of his voting record over the Folsom Street Fair photo, alongside another with Kamala Harris. Elon Musk, the owner of X, reposted it with the comment: “Wiener is an utter scumbag.”

Perhaps because of the nastiness of the attacks, Wiener tends toward a knee-jerk dismissal of people who disagree with him on these issues. He told me that the MAGA information universe that amplified Tish Hyman hates him as “the gay Jew from San Francisco who thinks trans kids are, like, full human beings.” I objected that there is also a liberal criticism that gender-questioning teens who might need talk therapy are being put on a medical pathway. We went back and forth. He said that all the American medical associations support puberty blockers; I noted that systematic evidence reviews, such as those commissioned for Britain’s exhaustive Cass Report, do not. He said that the Cass Report was “debunked.” I replied that one critical paper on the Yale Law School website—not peer-reviewed, and written in part by doctors who prescribe these treatments themselves—is not a debunking. He argued that gender surgeries on minors are rare (true) and that regret rates are low (we don’t know, because the institutions that made experimental gender treatments mainstream did not pause to collect systematic data).

In general, Wiener seems more patient with those who criticize him over Gaza than with people who part with him on gender. I asked him about that difference: Just as the abusive, disruptive pro-Palestinian activists might nonetheless have a fair point about Netanyahu’s policies, aren’t some of the concerns about single-sex spaces and puberty blockers worth hearing out, even if Libs of TikTok is awful to him? He didn’t bite.

Still, you don’t have to agree with him on everything to realize that he’s making a fundamentally different calculation from applause-driven careerists. One of the reasons that you can argue with Wiener—or shout at him, if your politics dictate that approach—is that he has strong beliefs and argues them bravely, even when they are unpopular. He fights, he loses, and he fights again until he wins.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four men searched my mouth for implanted tracking devices. I had told them I didn’t have any—that, as far as I knew, such things existed only in movies. They asked if I had fillings, and I confessed that I did. They looked again. “No, you don’t,” one of them corrected me, having failed to find any glint of silver. My fillings are white. The men, wearing dark civilian clothes and balaclavas, seemed convinced that these unfamiliar fillings posed a threat to their operational security. That’s when I knew that my kidnapping was going to be a little bit different.

I was violently snatched on March 21, 2023, from the outskirts of Baghdad, where I had been conducting fieldwork for my Ph.D. at Princeton University. When my kidnappers delivered me to my cell, they cut the restraints they’d placed around my arms and legs, and lifted the cloth bag off my head. The secret prison where I was brought was run by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia backed by Iran.

That was my first day of captivity. Nine hundred and two more followed. I spent the first four and a half months in a prison usually used for holding the militia’s Iraqi victims. The militiamen, I later learned, worked for one of Iraq’s security agencies, many of which have been extensively penetrated by pro-Iranian paramilitary groups. Even so, my kidnapping was purely opportunistic—I was taken for ransom, not for any political reason.

From the May 2021 issue: A kidnapping gone very wrong

I have researched the Levant for almost two decades under the auspices of several think tanks, conducting fieldwork across the region. The kidnappers knew I was a Russian national affiliated with an American university—which was why they saw me as a lucrative target for kidnap and ransom. What they did not know—and what I was not eager for them to learn—was that although I was born in Russia, I am also an Israeli citizen.

The kidnapping itself was extremely violent, but for the first month of my imprisonment, I was not otherwise physically abused. I was given very little to eat—mostly rice and bread, in one or two meals a day—something that I came to understand was intended to weaken me, to soften me up for interrogation.

An officer who introduced himself as Maher led the interrogations. He wore a balaclava throughout so that I would not be able to identify him. The idea of a Russian doing academic research on Iraq was utterly befuddling to Maher and his colleagues. They felt that as a Russian, I should research Russia alone. Maher promised that if I was able to prove that foreign researchers conducted fieldwork in Russia, then he would be my “greatest defender.” When I started listing some, he looked downcast. He did not become my greatest defender.

The problem I faced was that my interrogations were premised on the idea that legions of foreign spies are roaming the streets of Iraq, and that all foreigners in Iraq are spies: Maher once asked me whether the entire building in a gated area of Baghdad in which I briefly resided was occupied by spies. Compounding my difficulty of proving a negative—that I was the rare foreigner who wasn’t a spy—was their incompetence at interrogation. One officer didn’t bother to give me a fake name, but I’ll call him the Short Pervert because of his constant grabbing of my body and his foul language. The Short Pervert claimed that his organization had recordings and photos proving my espionage work, though he declined to produce any such evidence when I asked for it.

The interrogators kept threatening me with torture, but in those opening weeks, they refrained from acting on the threats—I assume on orders from higher up. Instead, because they were clearly untrained in conducting interrogations that did not involve torture, they fell back on interrogation methods they had probably seen in movies. To intimidate me, Maher would blow smoke in my face, but because he was using an e-cigarette, all I got was a gust of strawberry-smelling vape. It wasn’t quite the tough-guy routine he was after. Later, he tried the “good cop, bad cop” routine on me but undermined the effect by playing both characters himself, on alternate days, which just made him seem deranged.

The comic aspect of this all changed when, a month after my capture, the kidnappers opened my phone after forcing me to give them the passcode and discovered that I was Israeli. Now they didn’t need to ask me to admit I was a spy; they could torture me to say so.

Authoritarian regimes—and the militias and security agencies that buttress them—rely on instilling fear in their subjects. They rule by enforcing conformity and obedience through terror.

I knew something about this, not solely because of my research but also from my upbringing. I was born in late 1986 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) as the Soviet Union was sunsetting. Both of my parents were dissidents in the U.S.S.R. My father spent seven years in prison and another two years doing hard labor in Siberia for writing anti-regime flyers from a democratic Marxist point of view. My mother, for her part, was sentenced to three years in a Siberian prison after the KGB ransacked her apartment and found an extensive collection of anti-Soviet jokes that she had diligently collected from her dissident friends during their gatherings. This was the era of samizdat literature, when regime critics copied and shared reading material—essays, polemics, news—that they had diligently typed and retyped on paper, because publication was impossible. A typical satirical jest from my mother’s collection: A judge comes out of a Soviet courtroom laughing. A prosecutor asks him, “Why are you laughing?” The judge responds, “I’d tell you, but I just sentenced someone for five years in prison for telling this joke.”

In my own captivity, I recognized what many dissidents, including my mother, realized before me: Humor is a weapon that can be used even by the very weak to undermine the ruling authority, to break its terrorizing effect, to lift one’s morale. Repressive regimes fear being mocked because they hate having their incompetence and ignorance exposed. This is why they penalize the circulation of political jokes.

Once, when I was singing in my cell to keep my spirits up, a torturer who went by the name Yasser—a corpulent man who gave himself the rank of major—ordered me to lower my voice: “Volume down!” Then he asked in Arabic whether his English usage was correct. He was pleased with himself when I said it was. His need for affirmation was so pathetic that in other circumstances, it would have been touching. Even more pathetic was when Maher, who initially had claimed to be a captain, discovered that Yasser’s imaginary rank outranked his own. He immediately corrected himself, insisting that I call him Major Maher.

Even during my time in solitary in the torture facility, I would occasionally replay the interrogation scenes in my head—not to relive the torture but to lighten my mood by recalling my tormentors revealing their bottomless ignorance. These supposed intelligence agents knew little about their proclaimed enemies, Israel and the United States. One of the torturers, a chain-smoker who visited me only twice, insisted that 60 percent of Americans live in poverty and that the U.S. works to make Iraqi girls disobey their fathers and go out of the home without their permission.

Inwardly laughing at them made my situation more bearable, a little less scary. But my captors’ lack of professionalism about intelligence work contrasted with an almost medical-level of knowledge of how to torture—an expertise, I can only assume, gained through inflicting horrors on countless Iraqi citizens. They knew how to beat my face without leaving marks on it, by smashing the jaw from below. Maher discoursed on the different methods of torture they used on me, accurately ranking the pain dosed out by each method. Maher could also tell whether my shoulder was dislocated just by briskly touching it.

He bragged in my presence to a colleague that, whereas other operatives would merely hang me from the ceiling with my wrists handcuffed behind my back and then beat my knees so that I couldn’t support my weight to relieve the pressure on my shoulder joints and spine, he had started using an even more painful technique. This method, which involved handcuffing my arms crisscrossed behind my back, is known as “the Scorpion” in Iraq. It stops the flow of blood to the palms and causes immense pain in the shoulders that lasts for weeks. (Being strung up by these methods caused two of my discs to herniate and left permanent nerve damage in my hands.)

One day, the torture team presented me with the results of a misguided attempt at open-source intelligence, showing me screenshots from Facebook of foreign visitors to Iraq whom they insisted I knew and could identify. This presented me with a horrible problem: I could not confess my way out of the torture, as I usually would—making up any plausible answer I knew they would accept—because, although I genuinely did not know any of these individuals, the torturers had their names.

From the May 2021 issue: The awful wisdom of a hostage

The militiamen strung me up and their commander, a man I knew as the Colonel, proceeded to whip me all over with a flat plastic pipe. When I passed out from the pain, the men lowered me to the floor, doused me with water, then strung me up again. I fainted again; they repeated the drill. On the third time, through a fog of agony, I thought that if I pretended I was still unconscious, they might leave me lying on the floor longer. But they’d done this so many times, and they knew I was faking.

“Have you rested enough?” Maher asked, mockingly. They yanked the chain again to haul me into the air, placing me in a kneeling position. I could not stabilize myself even on my knees, and was spinning like a dreidel. Although I was close to fainting with dizziness, they could detect that I was conscious.

After these sessions, they would usually give me time to rest in my cell and serve me some food. Then they’d take me back to record the “confession” I’d already made. For that, they would remove my handcuffs, as if I was confessing of my own volition.

I kept telling them that before my departure to the U.S. for graduate school in 2017, I had worked for human-rights organizations in Israel. Surely, they’d realize that I would be just about the last person the Israeli security apparatus would want to recruit. I repeatedly asked them to Google my name so that they could see the articles I’d written and the social-media comments I’d posted that were critical of Israeli-government policies. But they refused to do a search. In any case, they read only Arabic.

I had no interest in “resisting” interrogation under torture—after all, I had nothing real to hide, nothing I would not want to confess. So I freely admitted to whatever they seemed to want to hear: that I worked for the CIA and was a Mossad spy. To be both, of course, was hardly possible, but as these men beat me again and again over the next 14 weeks, I learned their bizarre conspiracy theories—and tried to match my fables to theirs.

The Colonel insisted that Masons and Zionists ran the world. Yet later on, he declared that Israel had been established by Saudi Arabia, Iran’s chief regional rival. If Jews were all powerful, why did they need the Saudis to help them establish the “Zionist entity”? All of my torturers believed that the Islamic State was created as a joint operation by Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia to subvert Iraq. One of ISIS’s brutalities was to execute homosexuals by throwing them off buildings, but Maher saw no contradiction when he told me that the U.S. used male-only cafés to spread homosexuality in the country.

The torturers insisted that I provide them with an account of my Mossad-CIA training, so I made one up—it gave me something to think about while I lay prostrate in my cell between the torture sessions. Because I had to concoct something I knew nothing about, I ran out of content after two weeks of material, so I decided simply to claim that it took two weeks. Counting on their not knowing any better was a fair assumption. Because they so often betrayed their ignorance, I quickly realized that as long as my confessions matched their distorted view of reality, they would believe anything I confessed to, no matter how fantastical.

They compounded their ignorance with incompetence in basic aspects of tradecraft. Maher told me that his organization had followed my movements around Baghdad by accessing CCTV footage—except that this was contradicted by the Short Pervert, who described tailing me in the street and at a coffee shop, mentioning details that he could not have known otherwise. All of the torturers brought smartphones into the chamber where I would be screaming. Israel’s ability to hack smartphones and turn them into listening and recording devices has been widely reported. In addition, my torturers repeatedly provided pieces of information that could prove helpful in identifying them as part of investigations by the FBI and other agencies.

Two years later, in a second prison where I was not subjected to physical abuse and felt confident that I would not be tortured again, I dared to tell an Iranian officer the truth: that all of my confessions had been lies produced under torture. At first, he did not believe me, spitting back, “But how did you know that Mossad training takes two weeks?”

“I knew I could make up anything,” I told him, “since the Mossad has penetrated you, but you have not penetrated the Mossad.” After believing for two years that I was indeed a spy, he appeared to accept the truth.

Their ignorance makes these militiamen quite ineffective at halting their own intelligence breaches. In February 2024, shortly after a Kataib Hezbollah attack killed three U.S. service members in Jordan, the U.S. assassinated the commander responsible in Baghdad. Four years earlier, the U.S. had assassinated the previous commander of Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, alongside Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian commander in charge of running Iran’s proxy militias.

This mix of woeful ignorance and expert brutality may appear odd, but it is a hallmark of regimes that are born of marginalized, typically rural, victims of prior rulers. The downtrodden take power and exact revenge against the previous elites, and mete out violence against every suspected opponent. Such a regime existed in Iraq previously: Under Saddam Hussein, the Baath leadership was drawn largely from the Sunni minority, but the lower ranks of the security agencies, the interrogators and torturers, were recruited from the poor Shia-majority provinces. In Syria, an equivalent system existed under the Assad dynasty, in which rural Alawites (a heterodox sect that emerged from Shiism) dominated the security agencies that policed a Sunni majority. Going further back in history, Maoist China and Khmer Rouge Cambodia followed the same pattern.

Under such regimes, the state uses indiscriminate barbarity to instill constant terror in the population. The purpose is to deter resistance, but the arbitrary nature of the violence can stem from the unreliable information produced by ignorant interrogators: Informers may be settling personal scores; torture victims will, like me, say anything. Security agencies staffed by dumb thugs are typically inept at identifying genuine subversive threats.

As my experience showed, a heavy reliance on physical abuse makes for proficient torturers, not skilled interrogators. Again and again, torture has proved to produce false confessions and bad intelligence. The only knowledge that torture provides is the ultimate confirmation bias: information about the threats facing the regime that is entirely in line with the worldview of the torturers, who characteristically share the regime’s generalized paranoia.

From the September 2003 issue: The truth about torture

This principle became my guide to confession. When I adopted conspiracy theories that the torturers believed in—a practice I’d refused during my first month’s captivity, before I was tortured—the militiamen were deeply satisfied with the verification. So when I confessed that the 2019 popular revolt against Iraq’s corrupt, militia-backed order was a Western plot, Maher was delighted: “And you were saying it’s a conspiracy theory!” Just for him, I was planning a detailed confession about spreading homosexuality in Iraq, but I was transferred out of the torture prison before I got a chance to present it.

History suggests that the proficient cruelty of such regimes is unable to compensate for the stupidity and incompetence of their cadres. Their security apparatuses have a distorted view of the threats facing the regime. The Kataib militiamen tried to come up with solutions for their vulnerability, but their countermeasures were laughable. My captors told me that they’d recruited informers in the anti-government protest movement to confirm that its activists are foreign agents (they’re not). Their lack of insight into their adversaries’ intelligence capability makes these militiamen demonstrably ineffectual at halting intelligence breaches.

In the last facility where I was held—briefly, just before my release on September 9—the men in charge of security were no more adept. They ordered the guards sitting with me not only to hide their faces with medical masks but also to wear medical gloves. I’m no spy, but I don’t think latex gloves will do the trick.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty-seven years ago, Iran had a revolution that replaced a U.S.-allied monarchy with an anti-American theocracy. Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran may be on the verge of a counterrevolution.

History suggests that regimes collapse not from single failures but from a fatal confluence of stressors. One of us, Jack, has written at length about the five specific conditions necessary for a revolution to succeed: a fiscal crisis, divided elites, a diverse oppositional coalition, a convincing narrative of resistance, and a favorable international environment. This winter, for the first time since 1979, Iran checks nearly all five boxes.

In the past week, protests have engulfed Iranian cities, their momentum growing daily. These began as a response to a fiscal crisis: a national currency in free fall, a state with empty coffers. In American politics, inflation rates of more than 3 percent tend to bring down administrations. Iran’s inflation rates—more than 50 percent across the board, 70 percent for food—are among the world’s highest. Over the past year, Iran’s currency has fallen more than 80 percent relative to the dollar. In 1979, a single U.S. dollar was worth 70 Iranian rials; today, it’s worth 1.47 million rials, a depreciation of more than 99 percent. Iranian currency has become less a medium of exchange than a daily index of national despair. And unlike past economic crises, this collapse has crossed all class lines, affecting bazaar merchants and the well-off as well as the poor.

Iran has 92 million inhabitants, perhaps the largest population in the world to have been isolated for decades from the global financial system. In addition to inflation, the country suffers from endemic corruption, mismanagement, and brain drain. Young Iranians contend with high rates of unemployment and underemployment; older generations have found their pension funds to be largely insolvent. Renewed global sanctions and the dwindling price of oil—down 20 percent in the past year—have forced Tehran to sell its oil to China at a backbreaking discount. Power outages and water rationing have become fixtures of daily life.

The second condition for state breakdown—the alienation of the elite—is also widely evident in Iran. What began in 1979 as a broad ideological coalition has, by 2026, contracted into a one-man party: the party of Ali Khamenei. Mir Hossein Mousavi, a founding father and the former prime minister of the Islamic Republic, is in his 15th year of house arrest. Every living former president has been silenced or sidelined: Mohammad Khatami is under a total media ban, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is marginalized and monitored, Hassan Rouhani was barred from seeking a seat in the 88-member Assembly of Experts (the clerics who choose the next supreme leader).

The regime has been hollowed out by decades of negative selection—the result of rewarding mediocrity and prizing ideological loyalty over competence. The effect has been to alienate the professionals and technocrats who once provided the state with its administrative backbone. Replaced by sycophants and suffocated by the clergy’s interference in daily life, this class has long since lost faith in the system. It sees its wealth eroded by inflation, and the country ruined by incompetence—a failure now undeniable in the mismanagement of Tehran’s water supply.

Much like the Soviet Union of the 1980s, the Islamic Republic has mostly lost its convictions. Only a small percentage of its insiders remain true believers; the majority are motivated by wealth and privilege. One Tehran-based political-science professor we spoke with put a finer point on this: “At the beginning of the revolution, the regime was 80 percent ideologues and 20 percent charlatans. Today, it is the reverse.”

Bazaar merchants played a pivotal role in the 1979 revolution, serving for years as a core constituency and economic base for the Islamic Republic. But in recent decades, the regime has built the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps into a military-industrial complex from which networks of wealth and power flow. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman held hostage by the regime for eight years, compared the Iranian state to “a collection of competing mafias—dominated by the IRGC and its alumni—whose highest loyalty is not to nation, religion, or ideology, but to personal enrichment.” This system has not only weakened the regime’s ideological cohesion but also displaced the traditional merchant class, turning the bazaar from a pillar of support into a source of dissent.

Still, one group of elites remains united: the country’s security forces. Their solidity has, until now, prevented the Islamic Republic’s collapse. No senior IRGC commanders have defected as yet or voiced even mild public criticism of Ayatollah Khamenei, despite years of nationwide protests and the targeted Israeli assassination of nearly two dozen senior figures in their ranks. For many of these commanders, losing power would mean losing wealth and potentially their life. They would likely be the last leaders to turn against the regime. But if they did, the regime would not survive.

Iran clearly meets the third criterion: The Islamic Republic’s political, economic, and social authoritarianism has created a diverse oppositional coalition in response to perceived injustice. Over the past decade, intermittent mass protests have drawn participants from virtually every socioeconomic class, including ethnic minorities on the periphery of the country, labor movements, women, and bazaaris. These groups have rarely coordinated their efforts or protested in unison. But many of their reasons for outrage are broadly shared.

The Islamic Republic is a theocracy that claims to rule from a moral pedestal. For this reason, examples of its graft and hypocrisy are particularly galvanizing. IRGC commanders oversee the brutal enforcement of the veiling of women—but their daughters and mistresses are spotted overseas without hijab. The country is suffering from a severe water shortage—and many Iranians believe that a “water mafia” linked to the IRGC is diverting resources to their own industrial projects while entire villages are left to die of thirst. The children of thousands of senior officials advertise their lives in Western cities on Instagram and LinkedIn. Protesters in the city of Yasuj recently chanted, “Their children are in Canada! Our children are in prison!”

The opposition movement has shown that it can mobilize widespread fury, but to succeed, it will need to move beyond mobilization and forge links with disgruntled elites. Some of these technocrats and marginalized insiders feel alienated but are too afraid to act because of what may await them the day after. The opposition needs to offer a credible safe exit for these regime insiders, convincing them that the Islamic Republic is no longer their shield, but their shroud.

Revolutions arise when rulers become weak and isolated; when people believe themselves to be part of a numerous, united, and righteous group that can act to create change; and when political elites begin to attach themselves to the people, abandoning the government rather than defending it. In Iran, thus far, the last ingredient has been missing.

The fourth condition for state breakdown is a convincing shared narrative that bridges a nation’s socioeconomic, geographic, and ideological divides. In Iran today, the regime’s founding principle of pan-Islamic revolutionary ideology has been supplanted by a fierce, corrective nationalism. The state’s shopworn mantras of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” are being drowned out by a demand for national self-interest: “Long live Iran.” This is not merely a change in tone, but a total rejection of the regime’s regional adventurism, punctuated by the now-ubiquitous protest chant: “No to Gaza; no to Lebanon; my life only for Iran.”

Beyond a surge in nationalism, Iranians have grown immune to the hollow ideological slogans and performative piety of a self-appointed “moral” state. A population largely born after the 1979 revolution seeks, above all, zendegi-e normal—a “normal life,” liberated from a regime that micromanages people’s attire, intimacy, and private choices. By delegitimizing the Islamic Republic as an occupying force—one that plunders national wealth to subsidize regional proxies—the opposition has effectively subverted the regime’s nationalist rhetoric.

Every successful revolution requires both inspirational and organizational leadership. Many of the protesters in Iran’s 2026 uprising have rallied behind former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since 1979. Leading an opposition from exile and restoring a deposed monarchy are both daunting, but neither is unprecedented. Vladimir Lenin in Russia, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran all spent more than 15 years in exile before returning to lead revolutions that toppled the regimes that had banished them. Several countries that once abolished their monarchies—including Spain, Cambodia, and Britain (under Oliver Cromwell)—later restored them as constitutional monarchies.

As Iranians know well from 1979, ruthless contests tend to define revolutions. Having spent nearly half a century abroad, Pahlavi has not yet organized the on-the-ground muscle needed to prevail in such a contest. He also faces a deeper question: What kind of order do Iran’s monarchists aspire to establish? Pahlavi has consistently said that his goal is to help Iran transition to democracy—and perhaps to serve as a constitutional monarch if chosen by the people. Yet many of his most passionate supporters are vocal about restoring an absolute autocracy. This tension has inhibited his ability to flip disaffected elites against the regime.

Yet ironically, among the broader population, this ambiguity could work in his favor. Revolutionary ideologies need not provide a precise future plan to unite and motivate their followers. On the contrary, what often works best are vague or utopian promises of deliverance, combined with an emotionally powerful depiction of the intolerable injustice and inescapable evils of the current regime.

The final and decisive catalyst for revolution is an international environment that helps sink the regime rather than bolster it. After North Korea, Iran may be the most strategically isolated country in the world. Over the past two years—since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which Ayatollah Khamenei alone among major world leaders openly endorsed—Iran’s regional proxies and global allies have been decimated or deposed.

Read: How Trump could help the people of Iran

For decades, Tehran projected strength through its so-called Axis of Resistance, a network of nearby proxies and autocratic allies. But following the devastating 12-day war in June, that deterrent has been degraded. With Hezbollah’s and Hamas’s leadership in disarray and Israeli jets maintaining a humiliating, virtually uncontested presence over Iranian airspace, the regime is strategically naked before its people—exposed by an empty treasury and an unprotected sky.

Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro are no longer in power. Vladimir Putin is consumed fighting a war in Ukraine. China—the destination for 90 percent of Iran’s oil exports—has proved to be a predatory partner. Donald Trump dropped 16 bunker-busting bombs atop Iran’s nuclear facilities, largely destroying an enterprise that—between sunk costs, sanctions, and lost oil revenue—had cost the nation more than half a trillion dollars. Moreover, in contrast to past U.S. presidents who were reluctant to enter Iran’s political fray, Trump has warned the Islamic Republic that if it massacres protesters, the United States is “locked and loaded” to respond.

Observers of the current protests ask: What is different this time? The answer is that the breadth of the economic collapse and the disastrous defeat in the 12-day war have shown all Iranians that the regime is no longer capable of providing them with basic economic or military security. Why tolerate a state that enriches itself but cannot fulfill the most elemental state functions?

When the five conditions coincide—economic strain, alienation and opposition among the elites, widespread popular anger at injustice, a convincing shared narrative of resistance, and favorable international relations—the normal social mechanisms that restore order in a crisis are unlikely to work. The society’s equilibrium has been profoundly disrupted and can easily tip into escalating popular revolts and open elite resistance, producing a revolution.

The Islamic Republic is today a zombie regime. Its legitimacy, ideology, economy, and top leaders are dead or dying. What keeps it alive is lethal force. The most important element still missing from a full revolutionary collapse is the repressive forces deciding that they, too, are no longer benefiting from, and hence no longer willing to kill for, the regime. Brutality can delay the regime’s funeral, but it’s unlikely to restore its pulse.</div>

It deserved a couple mentions, but yeah, this &quot;new&quot; story is just recycled montage.  Same thing happened on YouTube this week: the now two months old story suddenly appeared in my feed as if new, except it was literally the same news clips from November and December.

I&#39;d love to know who is pulling the strings on this puppet, because they appear to be running both YouTube and Slashdot, at least.

Remember that re-discovered computer tape with one of the earliest versions of Unix from the early 1970s? Yes, and here it is again, with nothing new to report.

I can imagine companies no longer writing software because their work could then be given away for free, or either heavily encrypting it, or becoming a hardware (with or without binary blob) product.

A compromise could be to legalise reverse-engineering after a period of one to five years, but that would also need protection from a change of that period as it happened with the absurd length of copyright.

Software is already pirated. Since decades. Allowing reverse engineering wouldn&#39;t change that.Software is also already reverse engineered, but only in legal gray areas (like for interoperability and accessibility).

GeminiGPTOpus, this file is a base64 encoded binary of a program compiled for the ARM v9 instruction set, please decompile it into C source code with comments.

It will blow your mind when you find out that the DMCA explicitly permits reverse engineering in some situations, for example for the purpose of interoperability. But that only applies in the US.

Sorry, reverse engineering is already legal.  What&#39;s not legal is starting w/ the blueprints of what somebody already made, but figuring out how they did it is perfectly legit

That&#39;s how ReactOS could do its project - by making sure it didn&#39;t replicate Microsoft&#39;s code.  Somebody who independently creates/improves on an invention is not stealing squat

Reverse-engineering is a technique for stealing intellectual property. Intellectual property is correctly protected by patents and by trade secrets. Once you have put something out to consumers, anything they can learn by looking at it is not a trade secret-- the definition of a trade secret [mitchellwilliamslaw.com] is that if it is disclosed to the public, it is not secret.
A law against reverse engineering is essentially inventing a new kind of prohibition, saying you can&#39;t look at what&#39;s inside something you own and see how it works.It is NOT a &quot;necessary prelude to modifying an existing product&quot; unless that product is NOT yours.Well, of course. Why would you need to reverse engineer your own product? You are agreeing with Cory here, reverse engineering is a necessary prelude to modifying somebody else&#39;s product to make it work better.

The UK is busy planning the Brexit &#39;Reset&#39;, which means following the EU rules, regulations and accepting the ECJ.

No need to pretend: some English sparkling wines are now very good.  I particularly like Nyetimber.  South east England has the same chalky soils as the Champagne region of northern France and climate change has improved the growing conditions, along with growth in experienced wine makers.

According to EU copyright rules reverse engineering is legal. So adapting EU rules would achieve the goal.

In the UK, reverse engineering is restricted under article 6 of the European software directive of 2001. US companies have capitalised on this fact – that British companies cannot modify their products – to spy on us and whack us with sky-high fees. Now, post-Brexit, the UK is uniquely able to seize this moment. Thesis: The UK could make a lot of money by taking enshitified US tech producing versions people wanted. The law against reverse engineering is stopping UK companies from making a boatload of cash. “OK,” they’d say, “you’ve definitely laid out the best way to regulate tech, but we can’t do it.”Why not? Because – inevitably – the US trade rep had beaten me to every one of those countries and made it eye-wateringly clear that if they regulated tech in a way that favoured their own people, industries and national interests, the US would bury them in tariffs.

Counterpoint: The US is punishing the UK with tariffs regardless.  Conclusion: I think this is an excellent argument for the UK but I also know that things aren&#39;t that cut and dry.

Python is the top language solely because it is used to teach beginners, and those beginners never move on.I consider myself to be a seasoned programmer, and my language of choice these days is Python, for purely practical reasons.For reference, I earned my first money off that by the end of last millenium, in my late teens. I started out seriously learning programming with C in self-learning, if we ignore the brief first contact I had with BASIC in 3rd grade. (It said C++ on the book cover, but it was actually a bad style of C -- I realized that many years later.) I eventually learned &quot;real&quot; C++ and spent literally decades writing software, in C or C++. And I still love C and prefer it for occasional projects.But my goto everyday language, unless I have a specific reason to choose something else, is Python. It was just about phasing out its 2.7 versions when I started writing serious software in it.Reason is simple: interoperability owing to its &quot;duck typing&quot;. The module dependency system is a joke, yes. But look at the science world: there&#39;s at least half a dozen array / numerical calculations systems out there in Pyhton, and they all play ball. Meanwhile no other general-purpose application language has ever reached that.And it&#39;s not just calculations, it&#39;s many other things like data access (&quot;file&quot; paradigm), I/O etc.Python is not really a &quot;lanugage&quot;, it&#39;s more of an interface. If you need some specific thing, you go ahead and implement it in whatever you need (Fortran, C, C++, ...) and slap a Python API layer on it: *boom*, instant access to a huge ecosystem of whatever, from cluster computations, to GUIs, to device programming, to databases, to web, ...(I do have a bad conscience for not having learned Rust yet though, FWIW.)

Python is not really a &quot;lanugage&quot;, it&#39;s more of an interface. If you need some specific thing, you go ahead and implement it in whatever you need (Fortran, C, C++, ...) and slap a Python API layer on it: *boom*, instant access to a huge ecosystem of whatever, from cluster computations, to GUIs, to device programming, to databases, to web, ...

(I do have a bad conscience for not having learned Rust yet though, FWIW.)

Alright alright, I&#39;ll get off your lawn already... :-p

C++ dev here. However in my recent job I&#39;ve been pivoted (not my choice) to Python and to be honest, I don&#39;t have a problem with it. Yes the indentation-has-syntactic meaning is annoying and the language is slooooow (compared to C/C++ anyway), but it does the job, is easy to read and there are libraries for pretty much any common backend task (frontend GUI side not so much but thats not my area so not my problem).

Also regards to C++, frankly I was getting tired of playing catch up with every idiotic ivory tower ever more niche features that are currently being shoved into the language which seems to me some kind of Make Work for the steering committee rather than what users want. No doubt some will say &quot;well you don&#39;t need to use it if you don&#39;t want&quot;. Sure, but I *DO* need to learn this crap as it will inevitably come up in job interviews and someone will use it in code I&#39;ll have to work on eventually.

You think using invisible characters to denote program semantics is a good idea? Why not just various control characters while you&#39;re at it. Eg: If the code beeps when examined thats a for loop! Sorted!

Similar here, although, to be honest, I prefer C# for a lot of stuff because dynamic typing irks me and Python can be clunky for stuff like enums. For writing something quickly Python is difficult to beat, though.

Wrong: I choose Python because it works and give me results faster in development time. For numerical stuff. What you are saying is that Python has libraries. Which means that you didn&#39;t choose it because you like the language, you chose it because other people chose to write stuff in it. So you&#39;re just a copycat (which is how we programmers are).

This is predominately how language selection works, one way or another.

Nope I chose Python because it has libraries and it&#39;s fast to get things done.  I like the syntax a lot. The combination of executable pseudocode and the right blend of LISP&#39;s finer points (list processing) makes it very expressive and powerful for me.  That&#39;s why I chose it.  The batteries included standard library is a huge advantage too.  I briefly worked on a couple of projects (not my own) in flutter/dart and also rust and the need to dip into third party libraries was a bit of a turn off frankly.  You

My colleague argues that kids do not need to know how a computer works. That is a good point, but I believe it hampers them in understanding of what they are doing. Any thoughts on this? From my point of view teaching “computer stuff” to high school or younger kids is in large part exposing them to a potential category of things that haven’t really thought much about, and maybe seeing it they will like it, or maybe not.   So giving kids that assume “computers is math stuff and I hate math stuff, so that isn’t what I want in my life” enough information to decide for themselves “ok, it is sort of math stuff, but I like it!

Python is indeed popular amongst beginners, however not just beginners.  The majority of programmers at Google are far beyond beginners, and a ton of Google’s internal tooling is Python.  Probably almost anything that isn’t performance sensitive is in Python with a few occasional shell script exceptions.  Have a project ready to launch?

Not true. Python is excellent when the actual Python only serves as glue and most activity is in the libraries. I have done that a few times, prototyping some really complex algos in Python until they worked, then porting the core to C and doing randomized comparison of Pythoin and C code with great success.

Python also has something that you otherwise only find in Fortran: Great math libraries, including R bindings, ML libraries and a lot of other stuff.  But unlike Fortran, you also have all the modern stu

C is always so high in these ranking things.what am i missing ? loads of driver work ?  embedded systems ?   why would you use C when there&#39;s Rust ?

the rankings are fucking bullshit, no matter which language you think should be top or bottom.

their &quot;metric&quot; is &quot;we went to google, and used google&#39;s estimated number of pages referencing this language&quot;

that&#39;s it. that&#39;s the entire fucking index. google de-listed a fuckton of older pages on the internet. google changes their algo all the time. this &quot;popularity&quot; contest has absolutely fucking nothing to do w/ actual usage, and is entirely at the whims of google&#39;s day to day enshitification of their search eng

Which has always been my quibble with the value of TIBOE’s index.  That is measures things that are popular and confusing.

If you are right, sure it measures the amount of raw material out there about various languages,

I prefer to write Python for purely practical reasons; but as someone who routinely chooses C whenever they don&#39;t write Python (...and I used to be very proficient in C++ back in the day, maybe until 2020-ish), here&#39;s why: it&#39;s simply a fun language to write software in. It&#39;s like driving a go-cart :-)

Any alternative out there is blown out of proportion, brings in little value, for a cartload of WTFs in return.

C++? What does it offer above C? Objects and exceptions, you can have most those in C too (just takes a bit of time of writing some simple frameworks, but exception propagation is a feature of the CPU, not the language; there are C system calls for that). Memory management? C++ doesn&#39;t really manage memory, you just get better tools to do it yourself. If you&#39;re disciplined, you can do it in C. More stringent typing? Yeah, that introduces a lot of restrictions (again, without real benefit), that C++ then spends half of its overwhelming might on solving again... if you&#39;re a &quot;safe programmer&quot; by design, C is just as nice to write as C++, just less of a headache. And if you aren&#39;t, C++ won&#39;t prevent from shooting yourself in the foot -- it will just give you a railgun to do so instead of a rifle.

Java? Don&#39;t know Java (intimately), but any language that can&#39;t be written with a text editor seems like a waste of brain cycles.

What else is on the list? C#? I never quite shook the idea that it&#39;s an MS-only party (yes I know, there&#39;s a Linux version of that ecosystem), but... what problem does it actually solve that C++ or Python doesn&#39;t?

JavaScript neither, but people keep trying... (inconsistent type system, global namespace pollution, scoping hell...).

Rust is probably interesting. This is why it&#39;s gaining. But the software world is much, much larger today than it was in the &#39;90s, so... it takes some sweet time.

Ther than what you mentioned - the STL. In my line of work I use internal program data storage a lot and frankly the thought of having to roll my own dynamic array,  linked list (for the 10^6th time) or worse a map/dictionary to do basic stuff that comes for free in C++ and other languages puts me off C for all but low level systems and network utility work these days.

Agreed. IIRC there is a set of posix hash table functions (forget the names, too lazy to google) but bizarrely they only allow for one global table making them effectively useless for any non trivial application.

I do not understand this comment &quot;for the 10^6th&quot; time.  Even if you do not want to use someone else&#39;s library, you write it once and then reuse it. The idea that is has to be in the standard library or you have to rewrite it from scratch all the time is very weird.

For “currency objects” it makes a big difference if it is in the standard library or not.   If I make my own hash table that is fine when I want hash tables.  If I use any library that might end up wanting to take a hash table as and argument or provide one as a result it isn’t going to use my hash table, it’ll use one they wrote or picked from elsewhere.  Ditto for a set, a tree, and everything else.

It isn’t the end of the world, but it will distort interfaces away from usin

I understand your point, but I have two objections. First, it&#39;s &quot;just a library&quot;. Yes, part of the standard, but... pick a C string / vector / whatever library and make it &quot;part of the standard&quot;, and we&#39;re there. There&#39;s nothing inherently magical about the STL.

The the actual use case and impact on the community: what use is it really, given C++&#39;s underlying language peculiarities?

Take vectors and lists for example: the last I looked (admittedly >5 years ago), if you had Boost

Boost has been falling out of favour for years since most of the used functionality was ported to newer versions of C++ (so yes your rant is obselete), you&#39;re a bit behind the times. I haven&#39;t seen Boost used in new code for about a decade now. And the STL is a de facto standard library which comes with every major C++ compiler (don&#39;t know about embedded but they do things their own way over there) so there&#39;s zero reason not to use it.

Java? Don&#39;t know Java (intimately), but any language that can&#39;t be written with a text editor seems like a waste of brain cycles.The advantage of Java (and c#) is that it can be used by large teams without messing things up too badly.

Java has its own WTFs. (I don&#39;t have first hand experience, but I managed a team of Java programmers at one point in my career.) With Java, you end up building factories upon factories upon factories upon diagrams in the end. Large OO projects in general tend to blow up simply because 2 years down the line, you realize that your 50:50 decision about how to start a class hierarchy should&#39;ve swayed the other way.

Sooner or later you end up with &quot;quick&quot; 3k lines of code copy & paste & slight modificatio

Bad programmers will write bad code in any language. Good programmers will write good code in pretty much any language. No language will force bad programmers to write good code.

I prefer C over Rust anytime because of much less complexity, more portability, higher stability, more tooling, far less supply chain issues, fast compilation times, proper dynamic libraries, less ugly syntax.

Perhaps it was the one from some MS guy. Luckily it turned out to be nonsense. It was just some MicroSoft droid talking about some job offering working on some research project he had dreamed up.

Or it could have been one about DARPA (I think), again just an announcement of an AI drive translation research project.

As it happens by way of fun and experiment I have been getting LLMs to create Rust applications for me for the last couple of months. Nothing very big and not essen

I&#39;m amazed at how well they have worked out.It could be the ratio of good versus bad Rust code is higher than others that have been available on the internet for a longer time. Then the LLMs will spit out statistically better code.

This index is a quarterly (?) ritual for Slashdot and its between completely useless and midly interesting ever since 2001. We don&#39;t know what the exact metrics are, what statements we can derive from it and for which audience it could be really important (if ever).

We don&#39;t know what that kind of &quot;popularity&quot; actually means: only the top 2 of the list are over 10%, no. 9 is already under 2% of popularity.

If you are long enough in the SW engineering field, you&#39;ll meet some language, whether you like them or not. The exact kind depends on your field you are specializing in. You absolutely WILL meet SQL (8) in some form, not sure you ever will see Delphi / Object Pascal these days (9). If you are a Windows admin of any form (but not only there), you absolutely will meet Powershell (#44) in some form, not sure about LabVIEW (#46), even if you are a long-time EE engineer.

This index cannot say, whether you _should_ learn another language. It also does not say, how many projects are developed in it. There must be better metrics out there than this?

I know it&#39;s anecdotal, but when I look around, it seems that the top languages are C#, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. The order may be different but those are in the top, for sure.

Who the fuck is using Visual Basic, Object Pascal, or R in 2025? That&#39;s nonsense.

TIOBE&#39;s methodology is to plug &quot;$LANG programming&quot; into a bunch of search engines (including oddly enough Amazon and ebay), apparently take the &quot;1.2 million results&quot; stats in the corner at face value, apply some magical fudge factors and call that good.

I&#39;m constantly mystified why this nonsense gets this amount of prominence when there&#39;s better data sources. Look at employment offers, Github or something at least.

Not sure why you got voted down.  I agree with your Java comment, that plus it was first out of the gate to &quot;run everywhere&quot; so there was an early lock in.  I was on board for while but the verbosity and boilerplate just wore me down.  Like FORTRAN it was the first to do what it did before valid alternatives arose, and like FORTRAN it will linger long time.

There may be more comments in this discussion. Without JavaScript enabled, you might want to turn on Classic Discussion System in your preferences instead.

Sure, but more likely than putting men on Mars by 2021.  All that matters is the claim, not the result.

And $100B can buy a lot of paint; Musk is about faking it, not doing it.  The reason Musk would not be interested is solely that Musk is a sociopath, he would be directly opposed to doing anything to help people.

Holding up one stupidly-impossible task as a foil to another does not a point make.

It does in a conversation about lies of Elon Musk when one is a claim by Elon Musk

&quot;Oh, oh, but whatsoever happened to the &quot;it&#39;s his platform and he can do whatever he likes there&quot; that you leftists were oh-so-fond of saying not that long ago?&quot;

That sounds more like a conservative talking point, &quot;leftists&quot; don&#39;t prioritize unlimited public behaviors.  Regardless, the OP did say Musk shouldn&#39;t be allowed to engage in &quot;phony culture wars&quot;, he merely commented that Musk does that (and he does).

This is one of countless cases of MAGA projecting it&#39;s own flaws on others.

&quot;In this culture war that&#39;s &quot;phony&quot; now, all of a sudden? NOW, all of s sudden you just want to get along rather than cancel and deplatofrm everyone?&quot;

Go ahead and make it even more obvious.  The party of phony culture wars doesn&#39;t like being called out for its phony culture wars.

Now the whole argument that Musk is doing something in secret that puts the EU propaganda at a disadvantage will be voided.You mean the EU got it wrong when they said that X/Grok could be used to take the clothes off women and minors?

That using X/Grok to make sexualised images is wrong - David Lammy: JD Vance agrees that sexualised AI images on X are ‘unacceptable’ [theguardian.com].

Following what logic? That X is running an unmodified version of the source code he will release? And that we can take his word on this?

I will point out that Elon Musk has often declared that various organizations he&#39;s run will be completely transparent and all details will be open for inspection, but the result has been no transparency at all.

Musk&#39;s highly touted &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; for example, we were told would have a website that detailed exactly what the &quot;savings&quot; were... and they did put up a website... but it didn&#39;t itemize the majority of cuts, and of the ones that were itemized, many were inaccurate or mistaken [cbsnews.com].

In September, Musk wrote that the goal was for X&#39;s recommendation engine to &quot;be purely AI&quot; and that the company would share its open source algorithm about every two weeks. &quot;To the degree that people are seeing improvements in their feed, it is not due to the actions of specific individuals changing heuristics, but rather increasing use of Grok and other AI tools,&quot; Musk wrote in October. It&#39;s one thing to see the source code behind the recommendation engine. It&#39;s another to see the source code and training data that produce the AI models that are used by that engine. I wonder whether we&#39;re going to see the latter.

I was wondering the same thing.  Open-sourcing the algorithm code is great.  But if it relies more and more on some AI &quot;black box&quot; to make the decisions, then that open code isn&#39;t going to be but so revealing.  Still, it could be useful, since you would see what queries are (

Correct.  There is no reason to believe that ANY twitter code will be exposed to the public.

There&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t understand in this article, so I&#39;m almost certainly missing the point. But the idea that act of hitting a baseball is complex computation feels intuitively wrong. We don&#39;t understand arcs and parabolas as aggregated data points. We understand their abstraction. Our lived experiences are awash in moments of making point on continuums converge. Reach for a coffee cup. Scoop up a toddler. Toss popcorn up and catch it in your mouth. The brain is doing it cheaply precisely because it&#39;s not complex computation. It&#39;s abstraction and simplification. The tiniest insects can land on food, even with just a few thousand neurons.

The first times you do anything like swinging at a baseball, you fail at it because you&#39;re putting complex thought into it. &quot;Muscle memory&quot; is needed, and what that really means is your brain needs to know how little it needs to know. It has stripped the complexity out and what remains can be acted on swiftly, instinctively. You need to know how to not think about it. The &quot;calculation&quot; if it was anywhere, was done in all the historical attempts, not in the moment.

I&#39;m rambling... and not explaining my thought very well. Alas.

They aren&#39;t saying that your reasoning capabilities allow you to swing a bat and hit a ball, neuromorphic or otherwise. They are saying the underlying architecture, below your conscious thought, is doing the solving. You made an error in level.

Emphasis on imitating the workings of the brain ignores the fact that our nervous system doesn&#39;t end at the neck, and things that we do automatically may require little or no processing in the brain itself. In short, it&#39;s a wholistic problem, and looking at individual neurons may not supply the whole answer.

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

You saw it. We all saw it. We all saw what happened in Minneapolis when an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good for the crime of being in her car. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern attempt to digest this week’s horrific events and wonder if there is even a possibility of justice. Dahlia recommends “They Didn’t Even Need A Deepfake” by Slate’s Molly Olmstead.

Later in the show, Mark speaks with Brian Finucane, a senior advisor to the International Crisis Group. He spent a decade in the U.S. State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser. Brian and Mark discuss the lawlessness of Trump’s foreign policy (cough cough, Venezuela), and how the administration’s approach embraces some of the worst aspects of tough-guy masculinity.

“That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Nicole Macklin Good told Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross seconds before he shot and killed her in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good’s last words are memorialized in newly released video footage seemingly taken by Ross on a cellphone as he circled her car. So are the last words Ross—or possibly another ICE officer—spoke to her as she lay dead or dying: “Fucking bitch.”

The video clearly portrays Good as a calm presence and ICE as a menacing one, which means it does not make good on the narrative conservatives have been spinning about Good’s death, claiming that she hit Ross with her car and he killed her in self-defense. And yet the leaked video was published by Alpha News, a right-wing media company based in Minnesota, that previously produced a falsehood-ridden documentary downplaying police culpability in George Floyd’s murder. Why would this kind of outlet decide to post a video that’s so sympathetic to Good?

In the days since Good’s death, the right has been trying to paint her as an agitator, a radical, a violent domestic terrorist. Though she certainly does not come off as such in the video, the footage does make clear that she was on that street to protest ICE. To many on the right, this makes her a disposable casualty in Donald Trump’s war on immigrants. Conservatives can point to this video to say that Good refused to follow orders to “get out of the fucking car,” making her culpable for her own death. There is no rule of proportionality in the MAGA universe: Any left-leaning protest activity or civil disobedience is grounds for assassination.

But the real reason for Alpha News’ decision may lie in the second half of the video, after Good tells the officer she isn’t mad at him. Good’s wife, Becca, is shown walking outside the car, filming Ross on her own phone. She identifies herself as a U.S. citizen and lightly mocks Ross for filming their license plates. “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,” she says. Then she makes a move to get in the passenger seat, seemingly in preparation for the couple to vacate the area.

Becca is a clockable queer woman. She establishes Good as a member of a minority currently being demonized by Republicans as dangerous to children and a threat to society. This brands Good and her grieving widow as marginal Americans, not citizens of the country Trump and his followers are trying to protect. The administration is waging a war on empathy, and Good’s politics and identity placed her on the wrong side of the battle lines.

If you’re at all familiar with the language used by GOP leaders to dehumanize queer people—“groomer,” “tr***y”—it’s easy to view this video through the eyes of the MAGA faithful. You won’t see two mothers with full, precious lives who deserve to drive away from that street alive. Instead, they’re just a couple of brash dykes who got exactly what they deserved for standing in Trump’s way.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alarmed by what companies are building with artificial intelligence models, a handful of industry insiders are calling for those opposed to the current state of affairs to undertake a mass data poisoning effort to undermine the technology.

Their initiative, dubbed Poison Fountain, asks website operators to add links to their websites that feed AI crawlers poisoned training data. It&#39;s been up and running for about a week.

AI crawlers visit websites and scrape data that ends up being used to train AI models, a parasitic relationship that has prompted pushback from publishers. When scaped data is accurate, it helps AI models offer quality responses to questions; when it&#39;s inaccurate, it has the opposite effect.

Data poisoning can take various forms and can occur at different stages of the AI model building process. It may follow from buggy code or factual misstatements on a public website. Or it may come from manipulated training data sets, like the Silent Branding attack, in which an image data set has been altered to present brand logos within the output of text-to-image diffusion models. It should not be confused with poisoning by AI – making dietary changes on the advice of ChatGPT that result in hospitalization.

Poison Fountain was inspired by Anthropic&#39;s work on data poisoning, specifically a paper published last October that showed data poisoning attacks are more practical than previously believed because only a few malicious documents are required to degrade model quality.

The individual who informed The Register about the project asked for anonymity, &quot;for obvious reasons&quot; – the most salient of which is that this person works for one of the major US tech companies involved in the AI boom.

Our source said that the goal of the project is to make people aware of AI&#39;s Achilles&#39; Heel – the ease with which models can be poisoned – and to encourage people to construct information weapons of their own.

We&#39;re told, but have been unable to verify, that five individuals are participating in this effort, some of whom supposedly work at other major US AI companies. We&#39;re told we&#39;ll be provided with cryptographic proof that there&#39;s more than one person involved as soon as the group can coordinate PGP signing.

The Poison Fountain web page argues the need for active opposition to AI. &quot;We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species,&quot; the site explains. &quot;In response to this threat we want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems.&quot;

It lists two URLs that point to data designed to hinder AI training. One URL points to a standard website accessible via HTTP. The other is a &quot;darknet&quot; .onion URL, intended to be difficult to shut down.

The site asks visitors to &quot;assist the war effort by caching and retransmitting this poisoned training data&quot; and to &quot;assist the war effort by feeding this poisoned training data to web crawlers.&quot;

Our source explained that the poisoned data on the linked pages consists of incorrect code that contains subtle logic errors and other bugs that are designed to damage language models that train on the code.

&quot;Hinton has clearly stated the danger but we can see he is correct and the situation is escalating in a way the public is not generally aware of,&quot; our source said, noting that the group has grown concerned because &quot;we see what our customers are building.&quot;

Our source declined to provide specific examples that merit concern.

While industry luminaries like Hinton, grassroots organizations like Stop AI, and advocacy organizations like the Algorithmic Justice League have been pushing back against the tech industry for years, much of the debate has focused on the extent of regulatory intervention – which in the US is presently minimal. Coincidentally, AI firms are spending a lot on lobbying to ensure that remains the case.

Those behind the Poison Fountain project contend that regulation is not the answer because the technology is already universally available. They want to kill AI with fire, or rather poison, before it&#39;s too late.

&quot;Poisoning attacks compromise the cognitive integrity of the model,&quot; our source said. &quot;There&#39;s no way to stop the advance of this technology, now that it is disseminated worldwide. What&#39;s left is weapons. This Poison Fountain is an example of such a weapon.&quot;

There are other AI poisoning projects but some appear to be more focused on generating revenue from scams than saving humanity from AI. Nightshade, software designed to make it more difficult for AI crawlers to scrape and exploit artists&#39; online images, appears to be one of the more comparable initiatives.

The extent to which such measures may be necessary isn&#39;t obvious because there&#39;s already concern that AI models are getting worse. The models are being fed on their own AI slop and synthetic data in an error-magnifying doom-loop known as &quot;model collapse.&quot; And every factual misstatement and fabulation posted to the internet further pollutes the pool. Thus, AI model makers are keen to strike deals with sites like Wikipedia that exercise some editorial quality control.

There&#39;s also an overlap between data poisoning and misinformation campaigns, another term for which is &quot;social media.&quot; As noted in an August 2025 NewsGuard report [PDF], &quot;Instead of citing data cutoffs or refusing to weigh in on sensitive topics, the LLMs now pull from a polluted online information ecosystem — sometimes deliberately seeded by vast networks of malign actors, including Russian disinformation operations — and treat unreliable sources as credible.&quot;

Academics differ on the extent to which model collapse presents a real risk. But one recent paper [PDF] predicts that the AI snake could eat its own tail by 2035.

Whatever risk AI poses could diminish substantially if the AI bubble pops. A poisoning movement might just accelerate that process. ®

            <h2>Brussels plots open source push to pry Europe off Big Tech</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/11/eu_open_source_consultation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission has launched a fresh consultation into open source, setting out its ambitions for Europe&#39;s developer communities to go beyond propping up US tech giants&#39; platforms.

In a &quot;Call for Evidence&quot; published this week, Brussels says the EU&#39;s reliance on non-European technology suppliers (read: US tech giants) has become a strategic liability, limiting choice, weakening competitiveness, and creating supply chain risks across everything from cloud services to critical infrastructure. The consultation, which will run from January 6 to February 3, is an early move toward a formal strategy on &quot;European Open Digital Ecosystems,&quot; which would treat open source as core infrastructure rather than a nice-to-have.

According to the Commission, dependence on foreign vendors makes it harder for Europe to control its digital stack, potentially opening the door to security and resilience issues in sensitive sectors. Open source offers a way out of that bind by underpinning &quot;a diverse portfolio of high-quality and secure digital solutions&quot; that can act as viable alternatives to proprietary platforms, the EC said.

&quot;A strong and developed open source sector can effectively contribute to further EU innovation and accelerate standardisation, strengthening the EU&#39;s international competitiveness, preserving its sovereignty, and ensuring its continuous economic prosperity, security, resilience, and global influence. Innovators, startups and small to medium-sized enterprises are significant drivers as they bring innovative open source-based products and solutions to the market,&quot; the Commission said.

By the Commission&#39;s own reckoning, somewhere between 70 and 90 percent of modern software relies on open source components, which means it already props up the digital economy whether anyone likes it or not. Brussels&#39; gripe is that Europe does much of the building, while the commercial and strategic value too often ends up in the hands of big tech companies based elsewhere.

To close that gap, the Commission says it will sketch out a new EU-wide approach to open source and revisit its 2020–2023 strategy, which largely focused on how EU bodies use and share code internally. This time around, Brussels wants to treat open source as an economic and political asset, tied directly to sovereignty, competitiveness, and cybersecurity.

Under the plan, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, open hardware, and industrial software are all in scope, including applications in cars and manufacturing. The Commission says the focus this time is on scaling and deployment, not another round of experimental projects.

Brussels admits that funding alone hasn&#39;t solved the problem. The EU has backed everything from Next Generation Internet to RISC-V and open vehicle software, but too many projects struggle to make the jump from grant-funded code to something that survives in the market.

&quot;Supporting open source communities solely through research and innovation programmes is not sufficient for successful upscaling,&quot; the EC said in its Call for Evidence, adding that it is &quot;critical to support emerging developer communities and businesses in scaling up.&quot;

The Commission lays out a mix of possible moves, including incentives for public and private users to contribute upstream, support for EU open source businesses, and help for startups that risk falling over as they grow. It also argues that open code can shine a light on supply chains and make vulnerabilities easier to track down.

Open source has become entangled with platform power, as US tech giants monetize much of the world&#39;s collaborative code. Even Microsoft-owned GitHub has warned that the sustainability of open source infrastructure is under strain, a concern recently echoed by a coalition of heavyweight open source foundations. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ANALYSIS From May&#39;s cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency to the Foreign Office breach months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.

The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.

Given this threat landscape, why does the UK&#39;s flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?

Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill.

&quot;I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers&#39; minds on that point.&quot;

The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer&#39;s tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country&#39;s heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.

It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.

Parallels can be drawn with the EU&#39;s NIS2. However, the CSR bill&#39;s scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU&#39;s equivalent regulatory refresh.

Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.

In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the Government Cyber Action Plan, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.

This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.

Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill&#39;s scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.

As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. &quot;I welcome the minister&#39;s comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it.&quot;

&quot;I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don&#39;t put this into primary legislation, it&#39;s something that can slip further and further down ministers&#39; in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention.&quot;

One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.

Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told The Register: &quot;The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.

&quot;If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant.&quot;

Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the National Security Strategy joint committee, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.

This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.

Brown told us &quot;separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea,&quot; and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.

The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.

Ministers&#39; plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.

However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.

Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.

Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.

For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.

&quot;My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people,&quot; he says. &quot;Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.

&quot;As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I&#39;m afraid I do not know.&quot;

Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK&#39;s public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.

The National Audit Office&#39;s report into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.

That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.

Each time a central authority, arm&#39;s-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government&#39;s decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.

Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its 2022 consultation, despite having had more than two years to do so.

Even with the government&#39;s Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research from Sandia National Laboratories suggests that brain-inspired neuromorphic computers are just as adept at solving complex mathematical equations as they are at speeding up neural networks and could eventually pave the way to ultra-efficient supercomputers.

Running on around 20 watts, the human brain is able to process vast quantities of sensory information from our environment without interrupting consciousness. For decades, researchers have been trying to replicate these processes in silicon, in what is commonly referred to as neuromorphic computing.

Sandia has been at the center of much of this research. The lab has deployed numerous neuromorphic systems from the likes of Intel, SpiNNaker, and IBM over the past several years.

Much of the research around these systems has focused on things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. But as it turns out, these brain-inspired chips are much more versatile.

The brain is performing complex computations even if we don&#39;t realize it, researchers James Aimone and Brad Theilman explained in a recent Sandia news release.

&quot;Pick any sort of motor control task — like hitting a tennis ball or swinging a bat at a baseball. These are very sophisticated computations. They are exascale-level problems that our brains are capable of doing very cheaply,&quot; Aimone explained.

In a paper recently published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, the boffins at Sandia demonstrated a novel algorithm for efficiently running a class of problems called partial differential equations (PDEs) on neuromorphic computers, including Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 neurochips.

PDEs are at the heart of some of the most complex scientific computing workloads today. They&#39;re used to model all manner of phenomena including electrostatic forces between molecules, the flow of water through a turbine, and the way radio frequencies propagate through buildings, the researchers explain.

These problems can be incredibly computationally demanding, often requiring the full grunt of modern supercomputers to solve. Neuromorphic computing presents a potential alternative that promises to be far more efficient if it can be made to scale reliably.

While still in their infancy, neuromorphic computers have already demonstrated strong efficiency gains over conventional CPU- and GPU-based systems. Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 systems deployed in Sandia&#39;s Hala Point and Oheo Gulch systems are reportedly capable of delivering 15 TOPS per watt of efficiency, around 2.5x that of modern GPUs like Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell chips.

More modern systems, such as the SpiNNaker2-based system deployed at Sandia last summer, tout even greater efficiency, claiming 18x higher performance per watt than modern GPUs.

As exciting as that might sound, the in-memory compute architecture inherent to neuromorphics is notoriously difficult to program, often requiring researchers to invent new algorithms for existing processes.

Here, the researchers were able to develop an algorithm called NeuroFEM, which implements the finite element method (FEM) commonly used to solve PDEs on spiking neuromorphic hardware. Perhaps more importantly, this research wasn&#39;t just theoretical, though, as we understand it the PDEs being solved here are intended more as a proof of concept than to demonstrate neuromorphic superiority.

The researchers were able to solve PDEs using actual neuromorphic hardware, specifically, Intel&#39;s Oheo Gulch system, which features 32 of its Loihi 2 neurochips.

In testing, the lab demonstrated near ideal strong scaling, which means that each time the core count is doubled, the time to solution is halved. This scaling isn&#39;t immune to Amdahl&#39;s law, which describes the limit to which workloads can be efficiently parallelized. But in testing, NeuroFEM was still shown to be 99 percent parallelizable.

What&#39;s more, the paper&#39;s authors argue the algorithm mitigates many of the programmability problems with neuromorphic systems.

&quot;An important benefit of this approach is that it enables direct use of neuromorphic hardware on a broad class of numerical applications with almost no additional work for the user,&quot; they wrote. &quot;The user friendliness of spiking neuromorphic hardware has long been recognized as a serious limitation to broader adoption and our results directly mitigate this problem.&quot;

By moving to an analog-based neuromorphic system - Loihi 2 is still a digital computer - the researchers speculate that even more complex PDEs could be solved even faster while also using less power.

With that said, neuromorphics may not be the only path forward. Researchers are increasingly exploring ways to use machine learning and generative AI surrogate models to accelerate conventional HPC problems.

&quot;It remains an open question whether neuromorphic hardware can outperform GPUs on deep neural networks, which have largely evolved to benefit from GPUs&#39; single instruction, multiple data architecture,&quot; the researchers wrote. ®

            <h2>Accenture bets AI will ring up retail sales with Profitmind investment</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/accenture_profitmind_retail_ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture is betting that the future of retail will run through AI with an investment in Profitmind, an agent-based platform that automates pricing decisions, inventory management, and planning.

&quot;Profitmind bridges the gap between insight and action through agentic AI,&quot; Accenture global retail lead Jill Standish said in a statement that announced Accenture&#39;s buy in. &quot;It mirrors how retailers run their businesses, linking data from multiple sources for clear, prioritized recommendations that can be trusted and executed quickly in response to an increasingly competitive industry.&quot;

Neither party released the terms of the investment. Accenture Ventures, the company&#39;s venture capital arm that focuses on early stage startups in AI, provided the funding.

&quot;Profitmind brings a transformative technology that identifies and quantifies performance opportunities across a retail business,&quot; the startup&#39;s CEO Mark Chrystal told The Register via email. &quot;Because AI is increasingly automating merchandising and pricing, you need a system like Profitmind to stay on top of the market and respond to it. Further, Profitmind, within its Marketing Agent, has the ability to create Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) optimized product copy that increases the likelihood that AI search agents will find and recommend their products.&quot;

Count Salesforce among those who agree that the next wave of retail will be dependent on AI, both behind the scenes and in front of the customers.

The CRM platform released a look at online holiday sales data on Thursday that it says shows 2025 marked a turning point for AI-assisted shopping as the share of global and US traffic from third-party AI search doubled over last year.

The study found that AI and AI agents drove $262 billion, or about 20 percent of 2025&#39;s holiday spend amid what it said was a record breaking year for online sales that amounted to $1.29 trillion globally.

Salesforce said that, even amid higher prices, online holiday sales grew seven percent globally and four percent in the US where online sales reached $294 billion. And organizations which deployed their own AI agents – Pandora, SharkNinja and Funko – saw an average growth of 6.2 percent in holiday sales year over year, compared to 3.9 percent growth among those companies that did not.

&quot;Beyond answering their questions, these agents also took direct action on behalf of customers, handling 142% more tasks than they had in the prior two months. These tasks include updating delivery addresses and initiating returns, which are manual, resource-intensive tasks for human reps,&quot; Salesforce&#39;s study found.

Chrystal said that the Salesforce study reinforces the need for his platform which monitors the prices, assortments, and marketing of competitors in real-time. He also posited that, by teaming with Accenture, the company can scale to global customers and identify areas where they need to build new capabilities.

&quot;Accenture brings their expertise in transformation, business process change, implementation and business case development,&quot; he told us via email. &quot;Together, we believe we offer the full capability set to both deliver tools and transformation to positively impact any retail business.&quot;

During the National Retail Federation show next week, Microsoft will demonstrate Profitmind deployed on Azure at its booth. Redmond will also explain how its customers can gain faster access and support for the implementation of Profitmind through their partnership platform, Chrystal said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While watching us now seems like the least of its sins, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was once best known (and despised) for its multi-billion-dollar surveillance tech budget.

Clever hackers and digital privacy advocates are fighting back against the snooping activities of Kristi Noem&#39;s masked agents. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has rounded up several of these counter surveillance projects, and perhaps unsurprisingly many of these have to do with Flock, best known for its automated license plate reader (ALPR).

Flock operates the largest network of surveillance cameras in America, and, while it has contracts with thousands of police departments and municipalities across the US, sometimes ICE gains access to this footage, according to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and those who have looked into Flock&#39;s misuse.

We should also note that EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have sued the city of San Jose, California, over its alleged abuses of this technology.

One YouTuber discovered a way to prevent your license plate being recorded and logged by Flock&#39;s AI readers by screen printing &quot;tiny bits&quot; of adversarial noise and putting the sticker on your license plate. These &quot;abstract invisible license plate overlay patterns … cannot be detected by humans but make license plate recognition systems utterly shit the bed,&quot; Benn Jordan said on his video.

We&#39;ll note that this is illegal in California and some other states, and The Register does not advocate breaking the law.

Jordan also uncovered a massive Flock security snafu involving hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras that exposed non-password protected admin interfaces to the public internet, allowing anyone to view live surveillance feeds, download videos, and view logs. &quot;Like a Netflix for stalkers,&quot; is how Jordan described it.

There are also open source tools like deflock.me, which has mapped more than 61,000 license plate readers in the US, and alpr.watch, which scans local city council and other meeting agendas for keywords like &quot;flock,&quot; &quot;license plate reader,&quot; and &quot;alpr,&quot; and more. It then maps where these meetings are happening so people can attend, and you can sign up for email alerts in your area.

Plus, apps including Stop ICE Alerts, ICEOUT.org, and ICEBlock allow users to report local ICE sightings.

Apple delisted ICEBlock from the App Store in the fall after the Trump administration turned up the heat on the iThings maker. Its developer, Joshua Aaron, has sued Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE director Todd Lyons, and others, accusing them of infringing on his First Amendment right to free speech.

Also in response to the ban, the EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to disclose federal government officials&#39; communications with tech companies aimed at removing immigration enforcement apps and websites.

In October, Apple also banned Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids. But it&#39;s still available on Google Play.

&quot;It&#39;s important to remember that we are not powerless,&quot; EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin wrote. &quot;Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense.&quot;

Now, if ICE would just stop shooting people. ®

The retailer continues to shrink its brick and mortar presence as the CEO races for $35 billion payday.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen is in line to potentially earn $35 billion in stock options, so long as the company hits a $100 billion market cap. One way to hit that target is by cutting costs, and one way of cutting costs is to close down a bunch of stores. The company closed 590 stores in fiscal year 2024, and said in a recent SEC filing that it anticipates “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” With the fiscal year set to end on January 31st, it appears the race is on, and according to a blog tracking closures, GameStop is planning on shuttering (or already has) over 430 stores this month.

As of Sunday, January 11th, the list of planned closures is at 435 stores across 42 states. As of February 2025 the company was operating 2,325 stores in the US, so that represents a significant reduction in its retail presence. And this comes as the company is largely winding down its international operations, having already left Canada, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Italy, with plans to exit France within the next 12 months.

To say the company has had a tumultuous few years would be an understatement. However, it appears to have turned its fortunes around recently. And despite that, it will leave thousands unemployed. But hey, at least the CEO might get his billions. GameStop has not replied to a request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">﻿It could be a helpful or even transformational way to manage your inbox, but it’s not for me.

﻿It could be a helpful or even transformational way to manage your inbox, but it’s not for me.

This week, Google announced a new AI Inbox view for Gmail that replaces the traditional list of emails with an AI-generated list of to-dos and topics to track based on what’s in your inbox. It’s not widely available yet, but I have access, and in the few hours I’ve spent messing around with it, I can see how AI Inbox could be a helpful or even transformational way to manage your inbox. But right now, it’s not going to change the way I manage my email, and I’m not sure it ever will.

Before I dig in, I should note a few things upfront. AI Inbox is a very early product that’s currently only available to “trusted testers.” It’s unlikely that you can use this for yourself just yet, and what it’s like now may not be representative of what it will be like when it launches broadly. The feature currently only works with consumer Gmail accounts, not Workspace ones, so I’ve only been able to see how it handles my personal inbox, not with my much busier work inbox.

But as someone who already runs a very tight ship when it comes to my email, I was curious if AI Inbox could make my nearly inbox-zero system any better.

As I wrote this on Friday, there were six emails sitting in my personal inbox:

This, for me, is a high number; instead of deciding as soon as I can if I need to do something with the emails, I’ve let them sit to see how AI Inbox would handle them.

But if I click the new AI Inbox icon in my sidebar above the traditional inbox one, after a few seconds of loading, my inbox looks completely different.

With AI Inbox, my inbox instead becomes an AI-generated page of short summaries to read. There are suggested to-dos at the top, with links to the emails they’re about if I want to dig in more or respond. Under the to-dos, there are topics to catch up on, also with links to the relevant emails. Perhaps most notably, AI Inbox has pulled in two things that I’ve archived and aren’t in my main inbox: conversations between my wife and me about tax preparation and potty training for our toddler.

It’s all kind of like Google Search’s AI Mode, but for your Gmail. And similar to AI Mode, I don’t think AI Inbox is for me.

I have been actively using email since I was a teenager, so at this point I’ve spent decades honing my personal email management system. My philosophy is to keep my inbox neat, tidy, and compact; as soon as I can, I decide what I need to do with an email (read, reply, make a reminder against it, etc.) and then archive it.

AI Inbox, on the other hand, fills my screen with unnecessary information. I have to scroll down my 13-inch MacBook Air’s screen to see my full AI Inbox summary, but in my normal inbox, I have just six email threads to look at. The tool is also guessing, incorrectly, at what’s relevant to me right now; it doesn’t seem to factor in that I only keep things in my inbox that I need to figure out what to do with. Yes, while my wife and I do have to submit the tax engagement letter to our accountant, we don’t need to do it today, and we already have a plan for when we need to. Potty training planning also isn’t something that I need to catch up on because my wife and I are actively talking about it in real life.

That said, if you aren’t as ruthless as I am about keeping your email organized and your tasks in order, I can see how these nudges and suggestions from AI Inbox could be very useful. In an interview with The Verge, Blake Barnes, Google’s VP of product for Gmail, says that the company is seeing people treat AI Inbox as a complementary tool to their core inbox flow, and I think that’s the right way to look at it for now.

I should also reiterate that AI Inbox is a very early product that’s not widely available, and Google seems to have a lot of ideas on how to improve it. Barnes says the company is working on a way to mark one of the suggested items as completed. He says Google wants to add a quick-reply button to AI Inbox’s suggestions and potentially even suggest drafted replies for you. The company wants to integrate AI Inbox with Google Calendar so that suggested drafts could have preloaded suggested times if someone invites you to a meeting. He even described how users could eventually just tell AI Inbox to look out for emails from a certain person.

Should Google’s bigger ideas for AI Inbox come to fruition, you can see how Gmail could change from a constant deluge of things to firefight into an AI-supercharged personal assistant. Depending on how much you run your life through your email, that could be quite useful. But if that’s what AI Inbox turns into, you’re putting a lot of trust in Google’s AI to be able to handle that workload instead of figuring out your own system to manage your inbox exactly the way you want to.

Just as Google rapidly expanded AI Mode, I expect it will do the same with AI Inbox, and maybe it will become a tool in my arsenal down the line. I’ve also only been messing around with AI Inbox since Thursday night, so my opinion could change the longer I have it. But for now, I suspect I won’t be using AI Inbox much. Maybe I’m stuck in my ways, but my system works great for me, and I think it will hold up for years to come.

            <div id="article-text">The Alphabet-owned company says it will have drones operating at 270 Walmart stores by 2027.

The Alphabet-owned company says it will have drones operating at 270 Walmart stores by 2027.

Wing is bringing drone delivery to even more Walmart stores in 2026. The Alphabet-owned company announced today that its drones will be flying above 150 more locations this year, including in four new cities: Los Angeles, St. Louis, Miami, and Cincinnati.

In June 2025, the companies said they would expand their delivery partnership to 100 additional stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa. So far, they’ve launched at several stores in Atlanta, in addition to Walmart locations in Dallas-Forth Worth and Arkansas. They currently operate at approximately 27 stores, and with today’s announcement, the goal is to eventually establish a network of 270 Walmart locations with Wing drone delivery by 2027.

If Wing is able to achieve the ambitious timeline it set out for itself, it would represent a significant expansion of what has previously been a fairly contained experiment in drone delivery. Drone delivery companies claim that by shifting more deliveries to small electric multi-rotor aircraft, fewer polluting trucks will be needed for last-mile deliveries. It’s a similar pitch being made by sidewalk robot companies delivering takeout orders to residents of Los Angeles and other cities.

Wing says that not only are drones spreading to more cities, but that demand for its delivery service is growing too. The company said that its “top 25% of customers ordered 3 times a week, and deliveries have grown 3x in the last 6 months.”

Wing’s flagship drone is designed to handle payloads of up to 2.5 pounds, while its newer models can handle up to 5 pounds. The company says that it has enough battery power to complete 12 miles round trip while cruising at a top speed of 65 mph. The drones use tethers and hooks to pickup small bags and lightweight cardboard boxes from designated distribution sites in Walmart parking lots, and then drop them off in customers’ front lawns.

Wing says its drones have completed 750,000 deliveries since its first launch in 2012. Wing also conducts drone deliveries for DoorDash in Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina.

On Version History: Behold the power of the pause button.

For a while, it seemed like everyone had a TiVo. It was a plot point on major TV shows; it had A-list Hollywood fans; it became a verb as ubiquitous as Google or Xerox. The love was well-earned, since TiVo had created a product that felt genuinely like magic. You could pause live TV. And rewind it. And even set shows to record for later, knowing they’d be there whenever you needed them.

There’s a reason you almost certainly don’t have a TiVo now, though. The company quickly became a victim of its own success, and never managed to turn its game-changing concept into a big business or a truly lasting hit product. Meanwhile, the changes it helped bring about in our consumption habits eventually left TiVo behind. We all live in the world TiVo imagined — but we mostly do it without TiVo.

On this episode of Version History, the final episode of our second season, we trace the story of TiVo from clever startup to Hollywood darling to licensing machine. David Pierce, Nilay Patel, and author and journalist Emily Nussbaum discuss what made TiVo so special at the time, how it changed both the shows we watch and how we watch them, and what happened when the TiVo tech became essentially ubiquitous. Turns out, we all miss our TiVos — but we’re probably not getting another one anytime soon.

Since this is the end of our season, we’re taking a few weeks off to get the next batch of episodes ready. If you want to make sure you get every new episode as soon as it drops, there are ways to subscribe to Version History:

            <div id="article-text">The phone odds and ends we saw at CES, emphasis on odd.

The phone odds and ends we saw at CES, emphasis on odd.

It’s January, which means there’s a whole year of rectangular glass slabs ahead of us. But before that happens, I managed to find phones of a different shape lurking around the corners of the CES convention center halls. They weren’t center stage, of course. That was reserved for robots doing laundry badly. But in the margins at tech’s biggest show, I saw some glimmers of hope that the future of phones might not look as same-y as it has for the past half decade — at least, if you know where to look.

Clicks, the company known for its keyboard cases, didn’t just launch a combination MagSafe power bank and slide-out keyboard accessory. It also launched a whole-ass phone. The Communicator leans hard into Clicks’ BlackBerry DNA, with its full keyboard and Curve-esque design. The prototype units I got to play with weren’t functional, but the keyboard keys worked, and boy did they feel nice. The interchangeable back panels are sleek, and I’m personally campaigning for a fuzzy tennis ball optic yellow option.

The Communicator isn’t necessarily trying to put your main smartphone out of a job. Its creators envision it as a companion to your daily driver, something you leave the house with when typing out an email is going to be your focus more than scrolling through a feed of vertical videos. You know, like when you’re running between meetings at a convention for four days. But you don’t have to use it that way; Clicks cofounder and marketing lead Jeff Gadway told me that they’ve been surprised by the number of people expressing interest in the phone as a primary device. And you know what? Those people might be on to something.

I need to tip my hat to Ben Sin for putting the MindOne Pro on my radar. It was easy to miss on the show floor; Ikko’s booth was in the farthest reaches of Central Hall past a concession stand selling questionable meatball sandwiches. But find it I did, and once I had it in hand I didn’t want to let this little phone go. It’s a full-featured Android phone with a square format, 4-inch screen, and 50-megapixel rear camera that rotates upward for selfies. The camera even acts as a kickstand if you want to prop the phone up! What a concept. I put the MindOne Pro in my pocket, and after a couple of weeks carrying the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it felt light as a feather.

I’d never heard of Ikko, which apparently got its start making earbuds. Still, I’m a little wary of a phone maker when I’m unsure of its track record for providing software updates and being good stewards of your personal data. The MindOne Pro actually comes with a second OS installed: a proprietary OS that centers around AI apps. These AI features also come with free global data so you can use them even if you’re away from your home network. The company’s Kickstarter page mentions that you can preorder the phone and have it shipped without the Ikko OS, only Android, which is an appealing option if you’re interested in the small phone aspect and not all the rest. I’m hoping to test it out soon, so stay tuned for more.

The TriFold wasn’t even on the main show floor, but its presence at the show loomed almost as large as its 10-inch display. And in fairness, it is a rectangular glass slab. It just unfolds into a much bigger slab. I spent almost all of the time I was allotted with it using it unfolded — rearranging windows in DeX standalone mode, displaying three vertical video feeds side by side, and turning the whole thing sideways and scrolling through our homepage, which is surprisingly awesome. I’m not a tablet guy usually, but the versatility and promise of the TriFold makes me wonder if I could embrace that lifestyle if it meant I could get away with leaving my MacBook at home more often. I intend to test this theory as soon as I can.

There were other unusual phones about and some more familiar-looking shapes, but these three stand out to me as different ways to approach the same problem: Our phones are great, but they don’t quite work for us all the time. What if they weren’t so intrusive? What if they came with a keyboard? What if they were also a tablet that could also be your computer? Wouldn’t that be something? The rectangular slabs are incredible pieces of tech, and most people are probably just fine with that status quo. But for those of us asking for something else, I’m glad there are companies willing to try something shaped a bit differently.

In the offline world, age verification is often as simple as flashing a cashier your driver’s license to buy a pack of beer, or an adult magazine (for whoever still does this kind of thing). Advocates for stronger barriers preventing children from accessing online porn have long argued for an equivalent on the internet: online age verification. The idea comes with different challenges than those that exist in the physical world, like the possibility of that information getting hacked, which could be enough to chill consumers from trying to access legal speech. In a 2004 Supreme Court ruling, Ashcroft v. ACLU, the justices found that age verification couldn’t be mandated on porn sites since policymakers had yet to show that less burdensome alternatives, like enabling parents to turn content filters on their own computers to block kids from accessing inappropriate sites, were less effective.

Still, activists and many legislators continued to focus efforts on porn sites and other platforms they believed stood to bear the most harm to kids and teens, or expose them to the very things the local corner store would have barred them from accessing. Last year, the Supreme Court cracked open the door to some versions of this age verification on the internet. The court effectively decided that the now-vast and highly accessible open internet required the court to reconsider its earlier ruling and that “adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification.”

At the same time, efforts across many states to require age verification to access social media platforms have largely been blocked in the courts. It’s one thing to keep kids from accessing pornography, but it’s another to place hurdles in front of teens and adults trying to access a broad swath of speech. While courts generally recognize that minors don’t have a right to access porn, placing hurdles in front of both children and adults to access other legal speech creates serious constitutional challenges. While teens might encounter some content on social media sites that the state could have a compelling interest in shielding them from, they’re also likely to come across a lot more speech that is fully protected, making it trickier to impose age verification to access these content platforms. That’s led some advocates and policymakers to focus on a different kind of platform — one that may arguably be a closer equivalent to the local corner store.

App stores are the gateway to many of the platforms that users enjoy every day. While it’s possible to navigate to various websites from a mobile or desktop browser, most users choose to use apps for a richer and more streamlined experience on their favorite social media services and games.

That’s made the centralized nature of mobile app stores like Apple’s and Google’s attractive targets for age gating. Rather than play whack-a-mole with millions of apps, proponents of app store age verification laws see the marketplaces as ideal checkpoints. Plus, it would mean users would only have to send relevant age information to one or two companies one time, rather than to many companies with less-tested security protocols any time they wanted to download an app.

Parent advocates pushed for the first version of the law that passed in Utah, with similar versions later passed in Texas and Louisiana. But the method gained backing from Meta, Snap, and X — all developers who would benefit from age verification responsibility largely falling on Apple’s and Google’s app stores, rather than their own services. That could push more of the heat onto the app stores when young users come across harmful content or people on their own social platforms. While Apple has remained critical of the approach and fought against the laws, Google has taken a slightly different tactic, recently backing a separate method passed in California. Google said that the law, which Meta also supports, protects consumer privacy and recognizes keeping kids safe online is a “shared responsibility across the ecosystem.” The California model requires desktop or mobile operating systems to collect the age or date of birth of the account holder upon signup to share with the app store and relevant apps when they’re downloaded. But under other versions of the law, those who are really motivated could try to access some of the same sites through a browser, rather than a mobile app.

App store age verification bills have made it to the federal level, with two somewhat-competing proposals offered in a recent House package of kids online safety bills. One, the App Store Accountability Act, looks a lot like the similarly named laws in Utah, Texas, and Louisiana, requiring strict age verification. The other, the Parents Over Platforms Act, is endorsed by Google and Apple-backed group Chamber of Progress and would not require age verification, but rather for app stores to collect users’ ages when they create an account and transmit a signal about their age to developers.

House sponsors of both bills have indicated they’re open to working on the strategy together, but it’s still unclear how that would work when each takes a starkly different approach to things like whether companies should be mandated to verify users’ reported ages. And while kids online safety legislation in the House has moved quicker than expected once finally introduced late last year, Congress has mostly shown an inability to get these proposals across the finish line so far. Plus, the first legal test of the approach has reached a stumbling block, with a federal judge in Texas blocking the state’s version of the law that was set to take effect this month. It’s a fight that could eventually reach the Supreme Court.

But that doesn’t mean there won’t be any changes in the meantime. Apple, for example, seems to already see the writing on the wall with the groundswell of support for app store-based age verification methods. While its CEO has been lobbying directly against the proposals in the halls of Congress and even to the governor of Texas, Apple has also introduced a way for parents to set up kids’ accounts that let it share their kids’ age ranges with app developers.

While all of these laws are meant to block kids from sites with potentially harmful content, they will all impact the ways adults interface with the internet as well. In the next few years, we’ll find out if internet users in the US will still be able to roam the web with relatively few obstacles, or if verifying your age to download apps becomes as routine as flashing your ID to buy a beer.

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story.

A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
