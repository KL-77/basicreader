            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re human, you’ve probably hollered a curse word or two (or three) when barking your shin on a table edge or hitting your thumb with a hammer. Perhaps you’ve noticed that this seems to lessen your pain. There’s a growing body of scientific evidence that this is indeed the case. The technical term is the “hypoalgesic effect of swearing.” Cursing can also improve physical strength and endurance, according to a new paper published in the journal American Psychologist.

As previously reported, co-author Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele, became interested in studying the potential benefits of profanity after noting his wife’s “unsavory language” while giving birth and wondered if profanity really could help alleviate pain. “Swearing is such a common response to pain. There has to be an underlying reason why we do it,” Stephens told Scientific American after publishing a 2009 study that was awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel Peace Prize.

For that study, Stephens and his colleagues asked 67 study participants (college students) to immerse their hands in a bucket of ice water. They were then instructed to either swear repeatedly using the profanity of their choice or chant a neutral word. Lo and behold, the participants said they experienced less pain when they swore and were also able to leave their hands in the bucket about 40 seconds longer than when they weren’t swearing. It has been suggested that this is a primitive reflex that serves as a form of catharsis.

The team followed up with a 2011 study showing that the pain-relief effect works best for subjects who typically don’t swear that often, perhaps because they attach a higher emotional value to swears. They also found that subjects’ heart rates increased when they swore. But it might not be the only underlying mechanism. Other researchers have pointed out that profanity might be distracting, thereby taking one’s mind off the pain rather than serving as an actual analgesic.

So in 2020, the Stephens team conducted a follow-up study, using the same methodology as they had back in 2009, asking participants to either chant the F-word or the fake swears “fouch” and “twizpipe.” (Fun fact: the earliest known appearance of the F-word in the English language is “Roger F$#%-by-the-Navel” who appears in some court records from 1310-11. )

The result: Only the F-word had any effect on pain outcomes. The team also measured the subjects’ pain threshold, asking them to indicate when the ice water began to feel painful. Those who chanted the F-word waited longer before indicating they felt pain—in other words, the swearing increased their threshold for pain. Chanting “fouch” or “twizpipe” had no effect on either measure.

For this latest study, Stephens was interested in investigating potential mechanisms for swearing as a possible form of disinhibition (usually viewed negatively), building on his team’s 2018 and 2022 papers showing that swearing can improve strength in a chair push-up task. “In many situations, people hold themselves back—consciously or unconsciously—from using their full strength,” said Stephens. “By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder in different situations. Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and ‘go for it’ a little more.”

In two separate experiments, participants were asked to select a swear word they’d normally use after, say, bumping their head, and a more neutral word to describe an inanimate object like a table. They then performed the aforementioned chair push-up task: sitting on a sturdy chair and placing their hands under their thighs with the fingers pointed inwards. Then they lifted their feet off the floor and straightened their arms to support their body weight for as long as possible, chanting either the swear word or the neutral word every two seconds. Afterward, subjects competed a questionnaire to assess various aspects of their mental state during the task.

The results: Subjects who swore during the task could support their body weight much longer than those who merely repeated the neutral word. This confirms the reported results of similar studies in the past. Furthermore, subjects reported increases in their sense of psychological “flow,” distraction, and self-confidence, all indicators of increased disinhibition.

“These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,” said Stephens. “Swearing is literally a calorie-neutral, drug-free, low-cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.” The team next plans to explore the influence of swearing on public speaking and romantic behaviors, since these are situations where most people are more hesitant and less confident in themselves, and hence more likely to hold back.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While not quite a separate dialect, Formula 1-speak can be heavy on the jargon at times. They say “box” instead of pit, “power unit” to describe the engine and hybrid system, and that’s before we get into all the aerodynamics-related expressions like “outwash” and “dirty air.” Next year is a big technical shakeup for the sport, and it seems we’re getting some new terminology to go with it. So forget your DRS and get ready to talk about Boost mode instead.

The F1 car of 2026 will be slightly narrower and slightly lighter than the machines that raced for the last time earlier this month. But not by a huge amount: minimum weight is decreased by 30 kg to 724 kg, the wheelbase is 200 mm shorter at 3,400 mm, and the car’s underfloor is 150 mm narrower than before.

The front wing is 100 mm narrower and has just two elements to it, although for the first time in F1 history, this is now an active wing, which works in conjunction with the three-element active rear wing. Active rear wings have been a thing in F1 since the introduction of DRS—the drag reduction system—in 2011, but now there’s a philosophical change to how they’ll work.

With DRS, a driver could activate it to reduce their car’s drag if they were within a second of a car in front and at one of the marked DRS zones on track. From next year, the cars will have Straight Mode, which lowers both front and rear wings to decrease drag—this will be allowed for any drive on any of the designated straights, regardless of whether they’re close to another car or not.

And there’s corner mode, where the wings are in their raised position, generating downforce and making the cars corner faster. Those names are better than X-mode and Z-mode, which is what they were being called last year.

At the start of the season, expect overall downforce to be reduced by around 30 percent compared to this year’s machinery. However, the cars should also produce around 55 percent less drag, says the sport’s organizers, the FIA. The reason for the big decrease in drag down the straights is because of the new powertrains. The complicated and expensive MGU-H that recovered energy from an F1 engine’s turbocharger is gone, and there’s a more powerful MGU-K that drives the wheels together with the V6.

Now, the power split of V6 to MGU-K is 400 kW and 350 kW, but there will be times when the battery pack is not fully charged and the electric motor will contribute much less power. Making the cars slipperier through the air, then, is a way to ameliorate that impinging too much on the show.

Allowing cars to follow each other closely through corners was a big motivating factor for the 2022 rules change that reintroduced ground effect downforce to the sport, although some of those gains were erased by the teams as they developed their cars. So it’s good to know that remains a priority for the 2026 ruleset, too.

“The 2022 cars started off with a significant improvement in their wake characteristics,” said Nicholas Tombazis, FIA single seater director. “I don’t remember the exact numbers, but downforce at approximately 20 metres behind went from about 50 percent on the previous generation of cars to about 80 or 85 percent to start with on the 2022 cars. And then that gradually decayed during the regulation cycle to what it is now, where we are probably talking about 70 percent. We believe that the start of the new cycle will be more like 90 percent, better than it’s ever been.”

Tombazis added that “the front wing end plates morphed into shapes that permitted quite a lot of outwash, while the inside of the front brake drums also worsened the characteristics, as did the side of the floor. We learned a lot from that, and in developing the regulations for 2026 we hope we will maintain the good characteristics for a longer period or hopefully not have this decay again.”

Instead of using DRS as an overtaking aid, the hybrid power units will now fulfill that role. Overtake mode, which can be used if a driver is within a second of a car ahead, gives them an extra 0.5 MJ of energy and up to 350 kW from the electric motor up to 337 km/h—without the Overtake mode, the MGU-K tapers off above 290 km/h. There’s also a second Boost mode, which drivers can use to attack or defend a position, that gives a short burst of maximum power.

Change can often be unsettling, and over the past couple of years, there has been criticism of the rules, specifically the emphasis on so much hybrid power, which now requires active aero to not make the cars too slow. Some have even suggested a swifter end to the incoming rules and then a switch to naturally aspirated engines, although that now seems very unlikely.

F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali rejected that idea. “F1 needs to be relevant. And in terms of technical development, the fact that we receive new manufacturers in our sport means that the relevancy, from the technical perspective I’m talking, of course, it has been more important, has been achieved,” Domenicali told me. “Therefore, as always when there is such a technical change, it is quite massive. Like you said, it is not only a new power unit that you’re managing, it’s a new car, it’s a new way to race.”

As Domenicali said, the new technical regulations certainly have been a success in attracting new manufacturers to the sport. In addition to Audi joining the sport—we spoke with him at the Audi launch last month—Cadillac is entering as a new team as well (albeit without their own engines until 2029). After pulling back from the sport, Honda has recommitted. And Ford has signed up, too, providing the hybrid side of the power unit that will go into next year’s Red Bull and Racing Bull cars.

The first preseason test gets underway on January 26, with the first race weekend in Australia March 6–8.</div>

            <h2>The inside story of SpaceX’s historic rocket landing that changed launch forever</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/ten-years-ago-spacex-turned-tragedy-into-triumph-with-a-historic-rocket-landing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Dec. 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. The story behind this remarkable achievement is nowhere more fully told than in the book Reentry, authored by Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. To mark the tenth anniversary, Ars is reprinting a slightly condensed chapter from the book that tells the inside story of this landing. The chapter begins in June 2015 with a tragedy, the disintegration of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the CRS-7 cargo supply mission for NASA. It was the first time a Falcon 9 had been lost in flight.

Seconds after the Dragon-bearing Falcon 9 rocket broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, David Giger shouted into his headset, “Dragon is alive!”

In the decade since he joined the company straight out of graduate school, Giger had taken on management of the entire Dragon program, reporting directly to Elon Musk. He watched the CRS-7 launch from mission control in Hawthorne not with a particular role, but rather providing a leadership presence. Giger could sense the Dragon mission team, mostly younger engineers, freeze up as video showed debris from the rocket showering back to Earth. A lot of the people involved in the hairy early flights of Dragon, including the C2 mission in 2012, had moved on to other positions at SpaceX or departed.

“They were a great team, but I think everyone assumed it was over,” Giger said. Unlike a lot of his colleagues, Giger had endured some trying times at SpaceX, including three failures of the Falcon 1 rocket. After the Falcon 9 shattered, Giger noticed that Dragon continued to send data back. It had separated from the rocket and was flying some thirty miles above the Atlantic Ocean.

The key to saving Dragon was opening its parachutes before it got too close to the ground. SpaceX had not anticipated such a contingency, nor planned to send commands to Dragon as it rode on the Falcon 9 rocket. But in an emergency, the Dragon control center could talk to Dragon using ground-based antennas. So controllers in California frantically worked to configure this communications system and command the two drogue parachutes to open. These are the small, precursor parachutes that stabilize the vehicle prior to deployment of Dragon’s three main parachutes.

The command was sent, but nothing happened. Dragon continued to dive.

For about two minutes after the rocket’s breakup, the plucky spacecraft faithfully relayed data. Then, less than a mile above the ocean, below the horizon from the Florida coast, the data stopped. The spacecraft and its 4,000 pounds of cargo plunged into the sea.

Opening the parachutes was not as simple as pressing a button. It required operators to send more than a dozen specific commands, in the correct order, to manually deploy the parachutes. In their haste—the operators had only seconds to act before the spacecraft fell too close to the ocean for its parachutes to have a meaningful effect—they had forgotten to turn on power for parachute deployment.

The unnecessary loss of Dragon was one lesson SpaceX took away from the failure of the nineteenth launch of the Falcon 9 rocket. In the aftermath of this CRS-7 failure, during long and intense meetings, Musk focused most of his time and energy on the rocket. But more than a few times, Musk would turn toward Giger and other Dragon officials and complain about its loss. “Dragon shouldn’t be fucking stupid,” Musk would admonish the team. “It should have saved itself.” By the next Dragon mission, this emergency scenario would be baked into the rocket’s launch procedures. If need be, Cargo Dragon could be saved.

The high-profile failure of the CRS-7 mission in June 2015 hit SpaceX hard. After five years, of challenging work with Falcon 9 and Dragon, the company had started to hit its stride. The Falcon 9 won a string of lucrative commercial satellite contracts. NASA, too, invested billions of dollars in SpaceX to launch humans onboard Dragon one day. Then it all fell apart. Carrying cargo for its most important customer, SpaceX blew up its rocket in spectacular fashion.

The loss of CRS-7 came at an inopportune time for NASA, as well. Half a year earlier the space agency’s other commercial provider of cargo services, Orbital Sciences, lost a NASA mission when its Antares rocket exploded just above the launch pad. Critics of the agency’s support for commercial spaceflight reemerged in Congress, underscoring the severity of the setback and raising questions about whether private companies could be trusted with human spaceflight.

In the first three years SpaceX flew the Falcon 9 rocket, from mid-2010 to mid-2013, it launched just five times. This flight rate was completely unacceptable to Musk, and after introducing version 1.1 of the rocket, he expected this cadence to increase substantially. He charged the Florida site director, Brian Mosdell, with delivering the capability of launching more than one Falcon 9 rocket a month.

But that was not Mosdell’s only task. He also spent much of 2013 spearheading SpaceX’s charge to obtain a lease for a second launch pad in Florida. This was to be none other than the most historic launch pad in the Western hemisphere, NASA’s Launch Complex 39A. Surrounded by swampland and rising just a few feet above the Atlantic Ocean, the sprawling 200-acre site includes the hallowed ground where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took their last steps on terra firma before walking on the Moon. Later, dozens of shuttle missions also launched from there.

Following retirement of the shuttle in 2011, NASA no longer had any use for the launch site. The agency’s inspector general characterized the pad as “unneeded infrastructure,” and leasing the facility to a commercial launch company would offload millions of dollars a year in maintenance costs. SpaceX, already flying, seemed like the obvious choice as it sought a suitable site for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches and eventually crew flights for NASA. However, in the spring of 2013, another bidder emerged. Jeff Bezos held a reverent fondness for space history and sought to lease the site for Blue Origin and its New Glenn rocket.

To sweeten his proposal, Bezos offered to share the launch complex with SpaceX or another company. While this was a generous offer, Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket in 2013, nor was it close to having one. Because of this, NASA awarded a twenty-year lease to SpaceX in September.

Musk was giddy after winning, having secured the landmark site. But he was also tweaked by Bezos’s bid, which he believed was intended to block his access. In an email to Space News, Musk mocked his would-be competitor. “If they do somehow show up in the next five years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the space station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote. “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”

Musk also mocked Blue Origin during internal meetings at SpaceX. He would say things like, “A company must really stink to call themselves BO.” History vindicated him. Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket ready to fly from Launch Complex 39A within five years. Or ten. As of the writing of this book, the company’s New Glenn orbital rocket has yet to make a single launch attempt (Editors note: Blue Origin did launch New Glenn for the first time in early 2025). SpaceX, in the meantime, has launched more than 100 rockets from the old NASA pad.

Mosdell wrote a majority of SpaceX’s proposal to win the lease for 39A, including all of its technical materials, its schedule, and its budget considerations. After the company acquired the lease, he fully understood all of the work entailed in demolishing the old shuttle infrastructure and building a launch tower capable of supporting the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

His relatively small staff included seventy-two full-time employees and about eighty welders and other contract hires working on a new transporter. They already were maxed out by Musk’s push to launch monthly from SLC-40, putting in 80- to 100-hour weeks to keep up. Accordingly, Mosdell traveled to Hawthorne in January 2014 to meet with Musk and Shotwell about staffing up his operations for the buildout of Launch Complex 39A. During the meeting, Mosdell outlined what he believed to be a “lean” team to complete the design, procurement, building, and testing of the site. He then asked to hire sixty-eight people over the next six months.

Musk rejected the idea. The meeting spiraled downward from there, and Musk’s parting words to Mosdell were, “Go home and work harder.”

As a leader, Mosdell keenly felt the demands he placed on his team with intense work schedules. Eventually they would burn out and leave, or the quality of their work would suffer. When he raised these concerns with Musk and Shotwell, they would always say the money was tight, and if Florida could just buckle down and get the next payment milestone, some of the burden could be lifted off the team. Mosdell’s meeting in Hawthorne convinced him things really were never going to change. SpaceX would never enter a cruise phase; it would only accelerate.

“There was not going to be a genuine effort to fix the problem,” he said. “This was going to be a shut up, go home, and color kind of thing. And I decided I was no longer going to go to the Cape and tell my team to just keep going because things would change. Because I knew it was bullshit.”

During his six years at SpaceX, Mosdell had delivered. He built the team that scrappily built the SLC-40 launch pad for about a tenth the cost of SpaceX’s competitors. He worked as a launch director for six missions. They started with almost entirely manual launch operations, and by the end of 2013 reached the point where about 90 percent of the countdown was automated. Under Mosdell’s watch, the launch site had a perfect record. He also led the campaign to win NASA’s competition for its historic LC-39A site. He had laid the foundation for the success that ultimately awaited SpaceX in Florida.

Musk was not displeased. In his mind, Mosdell and the team at Cape Canaveral had not gone hardcore enough. Launching once a month was not enough. Musk believed Falcon 9 rockets should be flying from Florida once a week. In hindsight, this is a cadence the company would not reach for nearly a decade.

To fill Mosdell’s role, Musk turned to one of his people. Ricky Lim had joined SpaceX in 2008, spending months on Kwajalein during the final three flights of the Falcon 1 rocket. He came of age during the early years at SpaceX, surviving the crucible of the Falcon 1 and near death of the company. He then helped out at Vandenberg, alongside Zach Dunn and Lee Rosen. In the wake of Mosdell’s departure, Lim was asked to fill in as site director at Cape Canaveral for a few weeks. Three weeks would turn into six years.

The launch team at the Cape consisted of two halves. One was built from converts from the legacy rocket companies, including United Launch Alliance, where Mosdell had come from. The other half consisted of young engineers who had typically taken their first job with SpaceX. Musk felt Mosdell was too closely aligned with the legacies. Lim, he felt, would rally the younger blood.

And so he did. From mid-2014 onward, SpaceX started to hit a groove at the Cape. There were bumps along the way, of course, and eventually SpaceX would hire not sixty-eight additional employees as Mosdell had requested, but hundreds more for launch and pad rebuild work in Florida. Yet by April 2015, Lim and his team managed to launch a pair of missions—the sixth operational cargo mission for NASA and a Turkish communications satellite—within just thirteen days of one another from Florida. Eagerly, they moved to the next mission on the manifest, another cargo supply mission for NASA: CRS-7.

On the morning that CRS-7 lifted off, Lim set aside his site leadership role to serve as launch director. All went well for the first two minutes of the flight. However, at 2 minutes and 19 seconds, Lim started to hear chatter on the network about “data drops” from the second stage. He glanced up at a video showing the rocket far down range, a white streak climbing into an azure sky. While there was some sort of vapor cloud around the upper stage, the rocket’s nine engines were burning just fine.

“It was surreal,” Lim said. “What we saw in the data did not match what we were seeing. The first stage was still going. On the long-range cameras, it looked a lot like prior launches. I thought the second stage people were mistaken, to be honest.”

He believed it might be a ground software display issue or some other minor problem. A second or two more clarified matters. The large white cloud expanded, engulfing the rocket. As it dissipated, the tracking camera showed a shower of debris as pieces of the rocket began tumbling back to Earth. A hushed silence fell over the flight control room.

Musk watched the launch from England, where he was celebrating his forty-fourth birthday. Seeing his rocket disintegrate was a lousy birthday present. His first call was to Dunn. After working for five years launching rockets, Dunn had taken over running SpaceX’s propulsion department just a few months earlier and observed the launch from inside the Mission Control Center in Hawthorne. Dunn told Musk he did not have an immediate explanation for the failure and passed his phone to Jon Edwards, an engineer supervising the launch. Edwards said it looked as though some kind of pressure event had occurred on the second stage.

During past traumatic moments, Dunn had felt empowered to take immediate action. When a Falcon 1 rocket had started imploding during transport on a C-17 rocket over the Atlantic Ocean, Dunn had risked his life to climb inside the booster to open a pressure valve. But this was different. “In this case, I didn’t really know what to do immediately,” he said. “That was kind of the creepy thing about it. We knew we had to go and see if there was any debris in the ocean. But there was not a ton of immediate action other than starting to figure out what took place. It was a really painful, shocking moment.”

Dunn walked out of mission control and back to the propulsion area of the office. He called his team together and gave a quick talk about what had just happened. Like Giger, Dunn was now one of SpaceX’s veterans and had persevered through the Falcon 1 failures. He explained that launching rockets was a high-risk business and that the way to get through this challenge was to work methodically to find out what happened, fix the problem, and fly again.

Musk returned to California and dove into the accident investigation with frenzied energy. At least daily, and often multiple times a day, he convened meetings in his executive conference room on the first floor of the company’s headquarters. A black conference table dominated the middle of the room, around which nine chairs were situated in a large U. People presenting at the meeting filled the chairs. More engineers sat or stood around the sides of the room. Musk always stationed himself at one end of the table closest to the door, facing a wall that featured a large canvas print of the Falcon 1 rocket launching from Omelek Island, a cautionary tale of the company’s desperate roots.

“The vast majority of the people at the company today have only ever seen success, and so you don’t fear failure quite as much,” Musk said after the accident, which he publicly described as a “huge blow” to SpaceX. “To some degree I think the company as a whole maybe became a little complacent.”

Indeed, the company had grown ten-fold since its last failure in 2008. As the Falcon 9 had streaked through its first eighteen launches, some of the Kwajalein veterans like Dunn and Lim would discuss how few of the company’s employees had experienced the pain of launch failure. By the time of the CRS-7 mission, only about 5 percent of employees had that experience, so they were somewhat numb to Musk’s mantra that “only the paranoid survive.” Before every Falcon 9 launch, Musk would email the entire company and say that if anyone had a serious concern about the upcoming launch, he wanted to hear it. And he was genuine about this. He wanted to hear risks and, if they sparked wider concern, act on them.

Because of SpaceX’s growing size, downtime was expensive. With a staff of approximately 4,000 employees at the time of the failure, SpaceX needed to fly frequently to pay the bills. Personnel costs alone exceeded $70 million a month. So Musk pushed for a thorough, but rapid, investigation. During the CRS-7 failure analysis meetings, he would listen as department leads shared their latest information on the investigation. Often he interrupted with a question, a comment, or a sharp critique. These were tense and frustrating and difficult discussions because the true cause of the accident remained a mystery for several weeks. Underlying it all was a sense of unease and uncertainty about the fate of SpaceX.

“Elon brought a tremendous amount of energy to those meetings,” Dunn said. “You always have to bring your best with Elon, but in these sort of tense moments you had to be right there. One hundred percent focus. No bullshit. You better be able to explain what you know, what you don’t know, take direction very crisply, and understand what he means with precision. If not, he pounced.”

The responsibility for investigating the failure fell on one of Musk’s oldest and most trusted lieutenants, Hans Koenigsmann. At the time, Koenigsmann served as vice president of Flight Reliability and Mission Assurance, which essentially meant ensuring safe and successful launches.

“I feel like if I’m responsible for the risk, I’m also responsible for when it goes wrong,” he said. “It took five months, and I worked around the clock. I took one weekend off, I think. Otherwise, I worked every single day of those months. I worked my ass off, and my team did, too.”

Part of the challenge in understanding what had gone wrong is that the rocket had gone from flying normally to a conflagration in just 800 milliseconds. Koenigsmann’s team knew almost immediately that the problem originated on the second stage, which had not yet separated from the first stage. But it had all happened so fast, in a fraction of a second. As a result, engineers and scientists from SpaceX and NASA had just 115 pieces of telemetry data (that is, measurements from various sensors onboard the rocket during that critical second when the upper stage failed). From this, they ultimately determined that the liquid oxygen tank had ruptured after a container containing pressurized helium broke free inside the tank.

Why are there bottles of helium in the LOX tank? As a rocket launches into space, it steadily burns propellant and oxidizer. As these fluids drain, helium gas is released to fill the vacated volume and maintain a downward pressure. This ensures that propellant and oxidizer continue to flow into the engines. The helium container is called a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV, because a strong fiber is wrapped around a metallic container to ensure its integrity. The more difficult question for Koenigsmann, therefore, became understanding why a COPV bottle containing helium had broken loose and struck the upper dome of the oxygen tank with catastrophic effect.

Eventually, some structures engineers pinned the cause of the failure down to a small $4 part about the size of a Tootsie Pop. This stainless steel eye bolt, also known as a rod end, helped secure the COPV to the wall of the oxygen tank. It had broken during the rocket’s ascent. Koenigsmann said these rod ends were rated to withstand 10,000 pounds of force, but one of them inside the ill-fated upper stage had broken under less than 2,000 pounds of force.

Nearly all rockets and spacecraft undergo a rigorous design process. The last checkpoint before a project moves into fabrication is known as “critical design review.” During this review for the Falcon 9, SpaceX had required the use of a more expensive rod end, Koenigsmann said. This part costs about $50. Somewhere between this design review and the actual flight, however, a cheaper rod end had been substituted. This steel rod end cost significantly less and was manufactured by a casting process. This meant it was made by pouring steel into a mold, where it solidified, and then was ejected from the mold. The more expensive rod ends worked fine at cryogenic temperatures inside the liquid oxygen tank, but cast materials were more problematic when pulled under the force of tension as they could have unknown flaws hiding inside.

SpaceX tried to find the actual rod end that had broken, to ensure it had nailed down the original cause of the failure. Searching for a thumbsized part fifty miles off the coast of Florida, hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, proved to be a rather Don Quixote–like quest. The company even hired a remotely operated submarine to look for wreckage. In the process, it found long-lost hardware from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs, but no Falcon 9 parts. However, Koenigsmann was confident that a cast rod end was the culprit because SpaceX tested similar parts from the same purchase order and found they were subject to breaking under cryogenic conditions.

So why had SpaceX switched to a cheaper cast rod end? Musk had instilled a culture of always looking to cut costs. Someone decided that a $50 rod end was too expensive and would be substituted with a cheaper part. Every strut on the rocket used rod ends, so there were hundreds of them on the vehicle, meaning this single change saved more than a thousand dollars on a launch vehicle. In their zeal to control costs, Musk and his lieutenants made such decisions thousands of times. Had Musk not been so judicious about costs, the price of a Falcon 9 would have ballooned. And in nearly every case, the approach worked—except this one.

In the fall of 2015, Koenigsmann wrote a detailed report about SpaceX’s findings and presented it to NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. The report concluded that “material defects” were the most probable cause for the broken rod end. This essentially put the blame on the rod end’s supplier. NASA’s own, independent findings leveled a harsher judgment more directly on SpaceX. NASA attributed the failure to a “design error” by SpaceX. The space agency also said SpaceX’s quality control process should have identified the substandard rod ends before they were installed on the rocket.

“The implementation was done without adequate screening or testing of the industrial grade part, without regard to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a 4:1 factor of safety when using their industrial grade part in an application, and without proper modeling or adequate load testing of the part under predicted flight conditions,” the report stated.

In other words, NASA said SpaceX had messed up, not the supplier. Koenigsmann said he accepts that SpaceX should have done a better job screening the rod ends. But he said the supplier deserves blame as well. “SpaceX and the supplier screwed up,” he said.

Koenigsmann still keeps one of these rod ends in a desk drawer at home, to not forget the lessons of CRS-7.

Despite disagreeing over the fundamental cause of the supply mission failure, NASA and SpaceX continued to work together well. When Dragon sank into the ocean, NASA lost $118 million in cargo, including a crucial docking adapter needed to enable future astronaut missions to the space station. The failure also increased the US space agency’s reliance on Russia. For several months, the only means America had of getting its astronauts to the space station, and feeding them, came via a pair of small spacecraft designed during the Soviet era that launched from Kazakhstan.

Publicly, however, NASA did not chastise SpaceX for these problems. Rather, its officials remained supportive. During a US Senate hearing in 2016, when some elected officials would have celebrated an opportunity to lambaste the company, NASA’s chief of human spaceflight stood up for SpaceX when asked about the failure.

“They turned around very quickly,” the official, Bill Gerstenmaier, told Congress. “Within a matter of days, they were actually in a test facility on the ground testing the failure that they thought had occurred. That getting into test was much faster than I could have ever done on a NASA side. By the time I would have had the ability to get contracts written and done the proposals and put the test sequence in place, it would have been a half a year.”

SpaceX, in turn, sought to make NASA whole for its losses. A few months after the accident, the company quietly agreed to fly five future cargo missions, its sixteenth through twentieth flights to the space station, at discounted prices. SpaceX also increased the amount of cargo each Dragon mission would carry, giving NASA more bang for its buck.

This assumed, however, that SpaceX could get the Falcon 9 rocket flying safely once again.

Even had the cargo mission not failed, the Falcon 9 still faced months of downtime during the second half of 2015. Musk had decided the rocket needed another significant upgrade, to version 1.2, which later became known as Falcon 9 Full Thrust. This represented a massive evolution to the rocket’s capabilities. Drone ship landings were essential to making the economics of first stage reuse work, but they were not the only step. SpaceX also needed to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the rocket. No part of the Falcon 9 was spared a ruthless revision, and in the end, SpaceX engineers produced a new machine that increased the lift capability of the Falcon 9 by nearly one-third.

The propulsion department designed an upgraded version of the Merlin 1D engine that raised the thrust of each engine by about 15 percent. The structures department built a lighter rocket that was easier to manufacture. And all of the lessons learned from the Grasshopper program and landing attempts in the Atlantic Ocean were poured into the design of the new rocket legs and control systems.

However, the real linchpin of the upgrade involved a technology known as propellant densification, or squeezing as much fuel as possible onto the rocket. This sounds wonky and wholly uninteresting—but it is not. The science and engineering of super-chilling rocket fuel is fascinating, and its implementation tremendously risky. Within a year of seriously starting work on densification, SpaceX would blow up a rocket, destroy a launch pad, and lose a $195 million Israeli satellite. Some former Apollo astronauts viewed SpaceX’s approach as so dangerous they urged NASA to never let its astronauts fly on rockets fueled this way. Musk knew the risks, he accepted the risks, and in the end, SpaceX beat the risks.

Densification, however, was a tremendous challenge heaped on SpaceX at the same time the company’s employees were scrambling to recover from the loss of the CRS-7 mission, satisfy NASA’s concerns, and work through the finer points of landing first stages.

“Elon grasped the essentials of the reuse problem,” (senior SpaceX engineer) John Muratore said. “He kept telling us we’ve got to get more performance. We’ve got to get the liquid oxygen colder. He just kept driving us.” Somewhat understatedly, Muratore added, “It was quite an intense time.”

SpaceX densified both oxygen and kerosene, but since the former had to be chilled to much colder temperatures, it was far more difficult to handle. Oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth and essential for life. Humans cannot breathe without it, and in our bodies, it chemically reacts with molecules from food to produce energy. Similarly, this process of oxidation occurs when oxygen combines with a fuel. Firewood, for example, cannot burn without oxygen. And so oxygen is an essential component of producing combustion within a rocket engine. In fact, most rockets burn more oxygen than fuel on the way to orbit. Onboard the Falcon 9, in terms of mass, there is more liquid oxygen than kerosene fuel.

Musk reasoned that by packing more liquid oxygen into the rocket, it could get better gas mileage. He was certainly not the first person to think about forcing oxygen into a denser state and thereby increasing the amount that a rocket’s tanks could hold; NASA had previously studied propellant densification over the decades.

Recently, the agency had dismissed it, yet again, for the Constellation Program. But this decision was not based solely on physics. Rather, it was due to politics and rivalries between the agency’s field centers. Marshall Space Flight Center, in Alabama, already had its bread and butter with existing propulsion technology. And NASA management had little appetite for the exploding test articles that would necessarily accompany densification development. Neither of these were barriers at SpaceX, which could afford to fail—and indeed publicly celebrated its test failures as evidence of pushing beyond the bleeding edge.

By densifying liquid oxygen and kerosene onboard Falcon 9, SpaceX could squeeze an extra 8 to 10 percent of performance out of the vehicle. This was not trivial. It meant carrying two more tons of payload to orbit. This was extremely important for a reusable rocket, which was paying a significant mass penalty for returning to Earth due to its landing gear and other added components. For economic viability, therefore, Musk believed densification was as important as drone ship landings. If he could accomplish both, the Falcon 9 could truly be the world’s first twenty-first- century rocket—reusable, high-performing, and cost-effective.

So how does one densify oxygen? One way is to use liquid oxygen instead of gas. Liquid oxygen has a pale blue, ghostly color. It condenses at –297.33 degrees Fahrenheit (–182.96 degrees Celsius), far, far colder than the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica. It is colder than even the darkest areas of the Moon that never see sunlight. This makes working with liquid oxygen difficult. However, the upside for rockets is worth it: Liquid oxygen is 1,000 times more dense than gaseous oxygen, so most rockets use liquids.

What Musk wanted to do was make this liquid oxygen still more dense by chilling it down, almost to a solid. This is basic chemistry, as the cooler a substance gets the more its constituent molecules slow down, thereby bringing them slightly closer together. So the colder SpaceX could get its liquid oxygen, the more that could be packed onto the rocket.

This is how one day, in 2015, Muratore and another engineer named Vincent Werner found themselves on the phone with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a Maryland-based agency that is the world leader in measuring physical properties. Werner and a handful of SpaceX engineers had been poring over tables published by the agency that showed the various temperatures and pressures at which oxygen, nitrogen, and liquid air—a mixture of mostly oxygen and nitrogen— turned into solids.

“We called them because they had generated the tables,” Muratore said. “And they were like, ‘You know, guys, these were extrapolated tables. Nobody’s ever worked down here before. The tables are approximately accurate, but they could be off by a degree or two, or a psi or two.&#39;”

SpaceX was not just looking to experiment with liquid oxygen at its coldest temperatures; it planned to produce vast quantities of the stuff. For a single rocket launch, the company needed to make hundreds of thousands of gallons. The actual work of producing densified oxygen fell to a small team of about eight engineers in Cape Canaveral, including Phillip Rench.

He seemed an unlikely hire for SpaceX. Rench earned a degree in mathematics from Southern New Hampshire University, which is not known for aerospace greatness. Rench then spent nearly a decade working at SeaWorld in Orlando, where he performed an odd assortment of jobs, from underwater maintenance to fixing amusement park rides. While working at SeaWorld, Rench discovered a knack for devising solutions to challenging problems. In 2010, a veteran trainer at the park, Dawn Brancheau, was dragged to her death by a killer whale named Tilikum while gently rubbing the creature. After the incident, Rench helped build a giant submersible floor that lifted the whales out of the water, to make it safer for trainers to interact with the creatures. It was Rench’s first time working with complex valves and other components used in control systems.

After seeing a promotional video that depicted a Falcon 9 rocket launching and landing in Florida, Rench was blown away. So he applied to SpaceX and was hired early in 2014 to help modify Launch Complex 39A. Rench watched the fateful CRS-7 launch from the vantage point of this pad, alongside the other engineers, technicians, and interns working on the old NASA site.

“Everyone was super depressed,” he said. “But the next day we came back at 150 percent, with energy and passion. You know the five stages of grief? Yeah, we went through that really quick.”

Engineers at McGregor had performed preliminary densification tests, and some of the early work in Florida was led by Brian Childers and Gavin Petit. Rench worked with a team that included Petit, David Ball, Chris Wallden, and others. Because the Florida crew had no practical experience with super-chilled oxygen, they more or less just started connecting equipment and seeing what happened. SpaceX used liquid nitrogen to chill liquid oxygen because the colorless gas turns into a liquid at –320 degrees Fahrenheit (–196 degrees Celsius), below that of LOX. To further chill the liquid oxygen, the engineering team flowed it through a pipe, around which was wrapped a coil of tubing filled with liquid nitrogen. The two never mixed, but the warmer LOX would shed heat into the liquid nitrogen. As this heat moved in, some of the warmer bits of nitrogen started to boil off. SpaceX used very powerful vacuum pumps to suck this heat away. Over time, as the pressure dropped, the temperature of nitrogen fell below –340 degrees, and the liquid oxygen followed. They could not go much colder, as nitrogen freezes at –346 degrees Fahrenheit (–210 degrees Celsius).

Rench loved the work. He had spent years working on valves and other systems to control the flow, temperature, and pressure of liquids. When his team was pushing liquid oxygen to its extreme, it was not so different from SeaWorld. Over the course of a few weeks, he and the other engineers developed procedures by which this super-chilled LOX could be made and stored in a large, insulated tank at the LC-39A launch pad. They worked in pairs, for eight-hour shifts, seven days a week. The nights were eerie, with a soundtrack from purgatory.

“Liquid oxygen does not want to be densified,” Rench said. “Densification makes this low, horrible growl. When we first started densifying LOX, the Praxair delivery drivers would be pumping the warm LOX into the sphere and it would make all kinds of crazy noises. They were getting nervous to be around it, and these are people who have worked with liquid oxygen for pretty much their entire lives.”

NASA had been skeptical about SpaceX’s plans for densification at Launch Complex 39A, so it asked for a demonstration. After Rench’s team delivered and NASA signed off, the fluids team at the launch pad started stripping the parts and pumps away from the LOX chiller system. They were needed at SLC-40 to make the densified propellant for the debut flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust.

After two failed drone ship landings, Musk felt ready to try landing on land. This had a major advantage over the ocean, as the rocket need not contend with high seas. Ground was ground—flat and unmoving. But there was a major disadvantage, too. In returning the Falcon 9 rocket to land, it would fly near cruise ships in Port Canaveral, the National Reconnaissance Office’s multibillion-dollar Eastern Processing Facility, and numerous other launch pads and valuable assets.

SpaceX acquired an old Cape pad, Launch Complex 13, in February 2015 for the purpose of returning the rocket. Trip Harriss, who had been with the company since its days on Kwajalein and the Falcon 1, now bore responsibility for Falcon recovery efforts and led the build-out of Landing Zone 1. He and Bala Ramamurthy also worked to convince the Range commander that SpaceX should be allowed to aim rockets at the Air Force station, a first.

“As the Range commander, you’re used to rockets going away from you,” said General Wayne Monteith, who commanded the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral from 2015 to 2018. “So when you see one that’s 180 feet tall and coming back, as the person responsible for the safety of everyone on that installation, you start to get a little worried. Your career dissipation light starts blinking.”

Harriss and SpaceX provided data to convince Monteith and other Air Force officials of the project’s safety. It helped that the ocean landings, although not successful, came close to hitting the drone ship. So Monteith felt confident that if SpaceX damaged any property at the Cape, it would be the company’s own equipment. SpaceX also demonstrated that the vast majority of the booster’s return flight profile was over water. If something went wrong, a destruct signal could be sent to the first stage before it threatened anything on shore.

Before he signed off on a landing attempt, however, Monteith had to convince his supervisors the plan was safe. As the weeks ticked down toward SpaceX’s return to flight, opposition started to get louder from the National Reconnaissance Office, which was concerned that vibrations from the rocket’s sonic boom—as it slowed from supersonic to subsonic speeds—would damage the delicate work being done in its payload processing facility.

Range safety analysts predicted the Falcon 9 flyback would produce a sonic boom comparable to the major 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event in Russia, damaging buildings and homes in the Cape Canaveral area and causing widespread damage. There was little data to refute these claims, which came as part of a lengthy and official-looking 100-page report defending the analysis. Alongside those claims came a stark warning that the United States would lose assured access to space, possibly for years, due to damage of critical launch facilities.

Why was there such caution? Unless the military is in the midst of a war, it is a risk-averse operation. Asses are on the line if there is a screwup. Monteith knew the buck stopped with him and that by making the call to allow SpaceX to land at Cape Canaveral, it was his particular ass in the line of fire.

“During a meeting, a commander’s call, I stood up and said I believed this was the right thing to do,” Monteith said. “In doing so I understood that if anything went wrong, I would be fired.”

In early December, SpaceX received a green light from the Air Force to not just launch a missile, but to bring one back to the station. This is pretty remarkable, as SpaceX was flying a brand-new version of its Falcon 9 rocket, which was returning to flight after a launch failure, with densified propellant onboard for the first time.

Predictably, the run-up to the launch was chaotic. After SpaceX solved the rod end issue with NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration and obtained permission from the Air Force to dive-bomb its rocket back to the Cape, it still had to refine new procedures for densified oxygen.

One challenge with the densified oxygen was the inability to “recycle” a launch attempt if there was some technical or weather problem at the appointed time for liftoff. Once the super-chilled propellant was loaded onto the rocket, SpaceX had minutes to launch, or the liquid oxygen would become too warm. Although there was spare oxidizer in the LOX ball, offloading the warmed liquid oxygen from the rocket to this storage vessel would spoil the colder oxygen there. Dumping all the rocket’s LOX was not an option, as this would damage pipes and other launch site infrastructure.

As launch director, Lim also kept a concerned eye on the calendar. SpaceX had targeted the night of December 21, 2015, for the return to flight launch. The rocket would loft eleven satellites for the telecommunications company ORBCOMM into low-Earth orbit, with a total mass of about 4,500 pounds. This was a light enough load for the Falcon 9 to have plenty of spare fuel to return to Landing Zone 1. Everyone had worked intensely to get ready for the launch and was counting on a few days off over the holidays. Many talked of quitting if they did not get a break soon.

“We were desperately trying to save Christmas,” Lim said. “Our employees had been working months on end, and I worried that about a third of them might leave. If we scrubbed and plowed through the holidays, it would just have been murder.”

Once again, Lim directed the launch from inside the company’s control center about eight miles from the pad. In the early years, there were two principal leaders during a launch, the director and the chief engineer. This created a tension on launch day, as the director served as the “gas pedal” and the chief engineer had a more cautionary role as the “brake.” Koenigsmann typically served as chief engineer of launch, but due to his focus on the CRS-7 failure, he delegated the role to Robb Kulin.

Koenigsmann and Musk watched proceedings from inside the control room. The countdown was tense. In the final minutes before liftoff, scheduled for 8:29 pm local time, a camera inside the interstage area between the first and second stages showed drops of a pale blue liquid dripping down. This was a novel problem due to working with densified propellant for the first time, and it might indicate a number of bad things. Kerosene leaking might result in a fire. Liquid oxygen could lead to an explosion. Reviewing data and video, the launch team determined it was probably “liquid air,” or air that had been cooled down to cryogenic temperatures by the frigid tanks. Hastily, the launch team discussed whether to scrub and investigate the leak.

At T-1 minute, Koenigsmann turned to Musk. “You’ve got to make a decision,” he said.

Almost invariably, Musk delivered his decisions with confidence. He liked to command while others obeyed. But in this instance, with everything on the line for SpaceX, he responded casually, almost dreamily. “Well, I guess we’re going,” Musk said.

The upgraded version of the first stage performed perfectly. After dropping off the second stage, the rocket burned for home, dropping out of the black night down to the Florida coast. Nearer to land, from the vantage point of the launch control center, the rocket disappeared behind the tree line with a spectacular orange glow and a huge cloud of dust. Then there was a huge, building-shaking blast.

“That scared the shit out of us,” Koenigsmann said. He and Musk thought the rocket exploded. Musk’s countenance sank, despondent and disappointed.

Someone on the launch team suggested they check the video feed from the landing site. It told a happier story. The Falcon 9 rocket? It was there, standing upright on the landing pad, smoking in the mild Florida evening.

They had been fooled by the reentering rocket’s sonic boom, which had been delayed a few seconds traveling to the launch control center. The room erupted in applause and cheers.

Musk’s mood reversed entirely. He became delirious with joy, absolutely smashed full of happiness and pride for persevering long enough to see this moment. His faith in bringing rockets back from orbit and landing them, so often questioned, had been validated. Like a kid in the candy store, he kept pressing Lim and the launch team to go out to the landing pad and see his beautiful rocket. Three different people who had been with Musk for years said they had never seen him happier.

SpaceX had negotiated range safety protocols with the Air Force in the event of a landing. The rocket still had explosives onboard, including TEA-TEB ignition fluid, the rope-like flight termination system, as well as liquid oxygen and kerosene. A safety team had to secure the rocket first. But in less than an hour, Musk, Koenigsmann, and others, including Kulin, Harriss, Shana Diez, and Lee Rosen, donned hard hats to go running and skipping and dancing across the landing pad. As they danced about, they noticed there had been no apocalyptic meteor event, nor property destruction of any kind. Even the basic windows in an office trailer by the landing site bore nary a scratch. The launch of the new rocket and its unprecedented landing were a complete success.

“It’s hard to describe how epic this comeback was after our first Falcon 9 launch failure,” Koenigsmann said.

As he, Musk, and the others marveled up at that sooty rocket, illuminated by flood lights beneath dark and starry skies, they must have wondered if this moment could ever be eclipsed.

They were pretty excited back in Hawthorne, too. As the rocket touched down, hordes of employees crammed into the factory floor just outside mission control started chanting, “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!” A raucous celebration ensued.

The four thousand employees of SpaceX had wrought nothing short of a miracle in the six months preceding that night. The company worked on four separate, massive projects in parallel, packing their final exams into that single launch. Riding onboard the Falcon 9 rocket in late December were the company’s return to flight mission, a significant upgrade to the Full Thrust version, an unprecedented oxygen densification program, and the first landing. They saved Christmas, to boot.

The historic ORBCOMM launch and landing delivered one of the most cathartic and breathtaking moments in SpaceX history. I do not believe it is possible to overstate the significance. With its fate on the line, the company roared back from a terrible and financially disastrous failure. And, on the very same flight, SpaceX accomplished something no company, or country, had ever done before. Until then, SpaceX had followed in the footsteps of NASA and others in launching rockets, flying satellites into space, and landing spacecraft in the water. Sure, it did so in cheaper and innovative ways. But these were well-trodden paths. No one had ever, ever launched an orbital rocket and landed it back on Earth minutes later.

Catriona Chambers came to SpaceX in early 2005 as an electronics engineer. Within months on the job, she picked up responsibility for the Merlin engine computer on the Falcon 1 rocket. On that small rocket’s very first launch, there was a sensor that measured atmospheric pressure. After reaching space, the first stage would descend back to Earth, and when the sensor detected a thickening atmosphere, it would command deployment of a parachute. She and everyone who worked on the rocket knew this was preposterous. The rocket would probably never survive, and the parachute would be practically useless. But Musk pushed hard for reuse from the very beginning of SpaceX. Now here she was, almost eleven years later, observing it actually happen. As director of avionics, she watched with her team as the first stage landed, feeling the weight of history as she hugged and high-fived her friends.

“That was the point where it really sunk in that we had been working on this for so long,” Chambers said. “It just felt so massive, and I was so excited. And then I realized I needed to calm down.” She was eight months pregnant, after all.

Like a lot of SpaceX employees, Zach Dunn felt both exhilaration and relief at the launch of the ORBCOMM mission. He had taken over the propulsion department in February, with the aim of completing the Merlin engine upgrades for the Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9. Within the first couple of weeks on the job, two engines blew up. Then the CRS-7 launch failed, and Dunn was thrown into the tortuous investigation. Finally came the arduous campaign to ready the new rocket and update the launch site for densified propellant.

This gave the propulsion team fits right up until the launch date. On December 18, the company had to abort three separate attempts at completing a static fire test. The launch team was still learning, on the fly, how to load and offload super-cold liquid oxygen, when Musk came into the control room. Invariably, his presence raised the level of tension and urgency. Dunn explained to Musk that by the time the rocket was ready to ignite its engines, the propellant was warmer than the engines were expecting.

“My engine team was telling me this was not the right thing to do,” Dunn said. “That we weren’t going to get the data we needed from the test. The pressure from Elon was just absolutely intense.”

On launch day, Dunn sat next to Shotwell in Hawthorne’s mission control. As soon as the booster touched down, Shotwell leapt to her feet, joining the merriment. After a few minutes of also celebrating, Dunn left and walked across the factory floor to the propulsion area. About five dozen engineers were there, almost all of his propulsion department.

“It had been a hard fucking year,” Dunn said. “This was my hardest year at SpaceX, leading propulsion, going through those failures and trying to keep the team together, and the pressure of getting back to launch. It pushed my leadership and technical abilities to their limits. My interface with Elon was more direct and more intense than it had been before. It had taken a toll.”

As Dunn walked toward his desk, the other engineers, one by one and then in a rush, stood up and applauded him. A standing ovation. It was completely unexpected. Dunn had come into the department as an outsider, having led pad operations at Vandenberg. There were a lot of egos and a lot of brains in SpaceX’s propulsion department. During the preceding ten months, Dunn had fought with this team as well as for this team. He’d won some. He’d lost some. But after that night, he was no longer just their leader. He was one of them.

“Man, I’ve never felt better in my life,” Dunn said. “It felt incredible to experience that after the hardest fight that I’ve ever had professionally.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While some anti-AI advocates have called for some extreme property damage to halt the AI boom, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has a proposition that’s a little more down to Earth: simply shut it all down until we can figure out what the hell is going on.

In a video shared on social media, Sanders announced he’ll be pushing for a “moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop and deploy AI.”

His main contention is that society needs to slow down on the rapid deployment of new tech, and ask an important question: who benefits?

“Let us be clear: AI and robotics are the most transformative technologies in the history of humanity,” Sanders declares. “Just a few points we need to think about: one, who is aggressively pushing these technologies? Well, surprise, surprise, it happens to be the very wealthiest people on Earth.”

Sanders’ call comes at a time when AI-related capital expenditures account for around half of the US GDP growth throughout the year, as low-income Americans’ purchasing power plummets and vehicle repossessions hit levels equivalent to the Great Recession.

“Do you believe that these guys, these multibillionaires, are staying up nights worrying about what AI and robotics will do for the working families of our country, and the world?” Sanders continues. “I don’t think so. I think that these very, very, rich men want even more wealth, and even more power. “

“Question: if AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income?” the Vermont Senator challenges. “Very few members of Congress are seriously thinking about this.”

Sanders goes on to cite the growing degree of emotional dependence users are developing on AI chatbots, as well as the selfish ambitions of billionaires like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Dario Amodei.

“One thing’s for sure: this process is moving very, very, quickly, and we need to slow it down,” Sanders said. “This moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up with these transformative changes that we are witnessing, and make sure that the benefits of these technologies work for all of us, not just the wealthiest people one Earth.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump’s failing social media tech bid has tirelessly tried to reinvent itself into a viable business.

But despite forays into cryptocurrency, prediction markets, and a Roku streaming app that few have heard of, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is still losing a staggering amount of money.

The company, which owns Trump’s online megaphone Truth Social and is being run by his eldest son Donald Trump Jr., reported a quarterly loss of $54.8 million at the end of September.

Now, in its latest eyebrow-raising pivot, the company announced this week that it’s merging with the fusion power company TAE, formerly called Tri Alpha Energy.

It’s yet another peculiar detour for the troubled and massively unprofitable company, which started as a comparatively simple competitor to Twitter after it permanently suspended Trump from its platform in 2021. The firm subsequently merged with a blank-check acquisition company in March 2024, allowing it to be publicly traded.

The fusion news was met with plenty of investor enthusiasm, sending the company’s stock — under the ticker DJT — soaring by over 35 percent at the time of writing.

The company’s latest business foray is a serious long shot. Despite decades of research — and enormous interest from the private sector — scientists are only beginning to crack the point where highly complex fusion reactors, designed to harness the energy of fusing atoms, can generate more energy than they require to operate.

While it’s already being lauded as a technological revolution by many, promising an infinite source of clean and safe energy, plenty of questions remain about the tech’s feasibility, particularly when it comes to scaling up operations.

In today’s announcement, TMTG claimed that TAE has “significantly reduced fusion reactor size, cost, and complexity” and “built and safely operated five fusion reactors and raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital to date,” from heavyweights like Google, Chevron, and Goldman Sachs.

TMTG’s announcement could also put Trump at odds with a growing number of competitors in an increasingly busy space. For instance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made considerable investments in a nuclear fusion startup called Helion. Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is also funneling money into fusion energy companies.

Billionaire Elon Musk, however, is not interested, calling it an outright stupid idea. In a tweet posted just days before TMTG announced the TAE deal, Musk — who’s feuded bitterly with Trump in an on-again-off-again friendship — argued that the “Sun is an enormous, free fusion reactor in the sky.”

“It is super dumb to make tiny fusion reactors on Earth,” he added. “Stop wasting money on puny little reactors, unless actively acknowledging that they are just there for your pet science project jfc.”

TMTG’s leadership, however, are adamant that it’s a sound idea.

“Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,” CEO Devin Nunes said in the announcement.

Nunes also implied that investing in fusion now could benefit from the enormous amount of interest in artificial intelligence.

“Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense, and secure the energy needed to guarantee America’s dominance of AI technology,’ he The timing of the announcement is certainly intriguing. Mere days ago, Nuno Loureiro, a lauded theoretical physicist and director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was murdered in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, NASA revealed that it had lost the signal from its MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, one of just seven Earthly probes currently orbiting Mars.

The agency failed to reestablish contact with the spacecraft and hasn’t received any signs of life since December 4, according to its latest update. Worse yet, MAVEN appeared to be “rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars,” which could make future attempts to regain control far more difficult.

“The team continues to analyze tracking data to understand the most likely scenarios leading to the loss of signal,” NASA wrote. “Efforts to reestablish contact with MAVEN also continue.”

It’s an unfortunate development for a probe that has allowed NASA to keep in touch with its rovers currently tracking across the Martian landscape. It has also provided invaluable data about the Red Planet’s upper atmosphere and how Sun particles interact with it, key research that could shed light on how the planet became the hostile, barren wasteland it is today.

Technically, MAVEN is “still alive and transmitting on the low-gain antenna!” as Germany’s arm of the amateur radio operators organization AMSAT wrote in a Wednesday update on X. “Signal is weak on our 20-meter dish Sternwarte Bochum, but MAVEN is currently in command lock with [Deep Space Network] in Madrid.”

“Fingers crossed that they will be able to fully recover the spacecraft,” the organization added.

Now that its signal has been lost, the NASA is “working to mitigate the effect of the MAVEN anomaly on surface operations for NASA’s Perseverance and Curiosity rovers.”

Fortunately, there’s backup. MAVEN is one of four orbiters that can relay communications to support the agency’s operations on the planet’s surface.

“NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey, and ESA’s (European Space Agency’s) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter all remain operational,” the agency’s update reads.

As a result of MAVEN going dark, the agency has arranged to receive “additional passes from the remaining orbiters,” and the rover teams have “adjusted their daily planning activities to continue their science missions.”

It’s not the first time MAVEN has gone dark. In 2022, scientists were forced to put the spacecraft into safe mode after key orientation sensors “began exhibiting anomalous behavior,” per NASA — but that time, they were able to recover the spacecraft after just under three months.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As online platforms grapple with how to establish trust at a global scale and address growing concerns about authenticity, the adoption of profile verification on LinkedIn is picking up pace in 2025. India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.

LinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice-president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that more than 100 million users have added at least one verification.

In 2022, LinkedIn began rolling out profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before expanding to government-issued ID checks, and have since been extended to company pages and job listings.

Most LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.

About 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.

Geographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.

While the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.

India is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with more than 160 million users, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.

As verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform.

Earlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.

LinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.

“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/these-21-year-old-dropouts-raised-2m-to-build-givefront-a-fintech-for-nonprofits/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The last decade is filled with examples of fintechs that have reshaped how U.S. businesses manage money. Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.

Givefront, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout Matt Tengtrakool and UC Berkeley’s Aidan Sunbury, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.

Nonprofits generate roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure — tailored to nonprofit realities — can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.

Before starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.

“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”

Tengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, about 1.9 million of them in the U.S.

Givefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.

“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.

Although Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.

Nonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.

Legacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.

Rather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.

“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”

Givefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.

Since launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer-term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.

Tengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group.

Churches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.

The company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.

            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies, a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.

The all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.

Fusion industry insiders expressed curiosity over the deal and voiced concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the U.S. Department of Energy. Last week, industry representatives met with Energy Department officials, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a new roadmap to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn’t commit any new funds alongside the announcement.

TMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”

TMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.

Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.

TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.

But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.

Currently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion, are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.

If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.

TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.

Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.

In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.

After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.

On his 70th birthday, in 1905, Mark Twain gave a speech about the secret to successful aging. (If 70 doesn’t sound aged to you, bear in mind that because of high infant-mortality rates, the average life expectancy for someone born before 1850 was less than 40.) “I have achieved my 70 years in the usual way,” he declared, according to an account in The New York Times, “by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else.” The maxim he offered was this: “We can’t reach old age by another man’s road.”

Typical for Twain, this was solid folk wisdom wrapped in a joke. The secret to a long and happy life is clearly not smoking, drinking, and carousing. But he’s correct that there is no plug-and-play formula that works for everyone. Within obvious parameters, each of us should experiment with different ideas and specific ways of living, a proposition I have previously discussed. Some people are at their healthiest on a vegetarian diet; others will be so by eating Mediterranean. Some are happiest living in a big metropolis such as New York City and Los Angeles; others are living their best life out in the country.

These details aside, however, a few general habits do matter. I won’t detain you with the health-and-wellness stuff that you might hear from your doctor: Lay off the smokes and go for a walk, for God’s sake. I want instead to call your attention to certain patterns of behavior that are not so obvious but that help explain why old people tend to be happier than young adults. The sooner you can learn and adopt these rules for good living, the sooner you can enjoy their fruits.

No question, you will come across some grouchy, unhappy old people, but on average in the United States, older adults score significantly higher in well-being than younger adults. Older people experience lower psychological distress and negative affect, and more frequent positive affect. I have also written before about how older folks tend to enjoy positive changes to their personality: agreeableness and conscientiousness rise as we age; neuroticism falls. What explains this pattern is not immediately apparent. Without a doubt, acquired wisdom plays a role: Older people have more life data and make fewer errors. But three particular patterns of behavior that old people display do matter a great deal.

Arthur C. Brooks: How to be happy growing older

The first involves social networks. Early in life, you were probably encouraged to develop a wide range of friendships with different kinds of people, for the sake of your happiness. This was good advice insofar as you learned new ways of thinking and living from people outside your typical social circles. But it doesn’t mean that you need to expend special effort maintaining links with lots of people with whom you have superficial ties. This would just fill your free time with unrewarding interactions. Yet precisely this sort of broad but thin acquaintance characterizes the networks of many young adults. Older people selectively narrow their social circles to focus on the individuals with whom they share common passions, experience positive emotions, and derive satisfaction. The casual associates who don’t make the cut are left behind.

This might sound selfish, but people actually become more altruistic as they age—the second pattern of behavior that raises older people’s happiness compared with that of young people. In a 2021 survey of research on self-reported altruism and observed charitable behavior, four psychologists found that 14 of the 16 studies they reviewed revealed that older adults are more focused on others than younger ones. In one especially ingenious demonstration of this finding, researchers asked adults of differing ages to clasp a handheld grip-strength device called a dynamometer and squeeze it with a high level of effort in order to obtain rewards for themselves or others. Younger adults gripped harder than older adults for self-rewards; older adults gripped harder than the younger adults to gain rewards for others.

The third pattern involves how older people react to difficult events in life. As a person ages, they usually get better at both avoiding and dealing with life stress. One 2023 longitudinal study involving nearly 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 found that 70-year-olds felt stress on 40 percent fewer days than 25-year-olds did. Part of this is because the elders exposed themselves less to stressful events, but it is also because they were less reactive to stressful situations. Some of this is surely down to life circumstances: Retired 70-somethings no longer have demanding jobs. But another factor is that when old people encounter a stressful situation, they tend simply to shrug it off. Whether to respond to a challenging event might not seem voluntary, but in fact, it can be—and when the stress is unavoidable, the elderly simply react less by caring less.

As I was writing this essay, one experience came to mind that reinforced the points above, involving a two-day meeting that I’d attended in Rome some 25 years ago for a large international charity. The conference convened a small group of well-being specialists —some very junior (as I was at the time), some much older and more famous. Among the latter was a 60-year-old woman of global stature in the field. Feeling honored to be in her company, I paid close attention to her behavior. At the time, it seemed a bit strange; now it does not.

She had flown long haul through the night to attend the meeting, without compensation, and participated fully in every session. But when it came to the lavish dinner party held on the last night of the conference—which to me was a great perk—she walked into the bistro and declared, “This place is too loud” and left. This remarkable woman was exhibiting all three happiness patterns: She was spending time professionally with people who shared her passion for a cause, she was making a personal effort and donating her considerable expertise, and she was saying no to something that wasn’t worth the stress and sacrifice for her.

At 36, I was amazed that she’d pass on the party. Today, at 61, I follow her example: I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.

So what follows are three general rules I learned from older people that lead to higher well-being.

1. Go deep or go home. I try to ensure that my social relationships—those that are voluntary and involve discretionary time—focus only on facets of life that matter: love, faith, philosophy, virtue, culture, aesthetics. I don’t want to talk about my beach vacation, or yours, unless a major epiphany occurred as the tide came in.

2. Serve more. A unique channel of well-being is serving others in causes I care about. This can mean giving money and time, of course. But it also entails regularly subjecting my work to a “values test”: Does each activity primarily edify and uplift others?

3. Care less. I think back to the things that kept me awake as a younger man—this conflict at work, that worry about money—and shake my head. Now when something is bothering me or threatens to stress me out, I ask myself whether the issue is likely to be bothering me in a week’s time. If the answer is no, I try to get a head start right then on not caring.

True to his craft as a satirist, Twain preferred to mock the whole business of elders dispensing counsel to youngsters, as he did in his 1882 essay “Advice to Youth”: “If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick.”

I strongly suspect, however, that Twain followed better rules than this by the time he was 70. Closing his birthday remarks, the old riverboat pilot said that he had laid a course “toward the sinking sun with a contented heart”—no doubt by following the happy (if not quite so funny) principles above.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The cartoonist and journalist Joe Sacco has made a career of rescuing history from the cleavages of memory. One set of scenes in his 2009 book, Footnotes in Gaza, exemplifies this, revealing how testimony about painful events can diverge among witnesses, even within a family. Sacco speaks with an elderly woman named Omm Nafez, illustrating her story: She says that her husband and two of his brothers were shot by Israeli soldiers while walking out of the family home; a third brother, Khamis, jumped over a courtyard wall and survived. When Sacco finds Khamis, however, his account doesn’t entirely match Nafez’s. He recalls that his brothers were lined up in the courtyard and shot, killed not in a surprise scuffle but by premeditated execution. Khamis remembers visiting one of these brothers on his deathbed, but Nafez and another source say that Khamis was not there. So Sacco depicts both variations, while drawing out their disjunctions through commentary and supplementary reporting. The reader experiences these memories, and then questions them, and then at last sees the author’s process as he labors to tell the most honest-possible version of the truth.

Key word: see. Sacco reported Footnotes in Gaza from Khan Younis and Rafah, two cities at the south end of the Gaza Strip, over multiple trips in the aughts, and ultimately told a larger story—which stretches over decades of displacement and violence—in comic-strip panels. In this format, he is a character too, his round glasses and rabbit teeth peeking out amid the clustered limbs and busy tableaus. He’s used this approach to investigate catastrophes around the world, reporting from Chechnya, India, Iraq, Canada’s Northwest Territories, and the International Criminal Court. His work combines on-the-ground reportage with historical reconstruction, often stitched together from a patchwork of oral recollections.

In all of his coverage, Sacco places you inside the moment, dynamically re-creating not only how it looks but also how it feels. Despite his intense and difficult subject matter, his style reflects the unruly world of the underground comics in which he came of age. In his early, memoiristic Yahoo series, he employed an outlandish vernacular, influenced by R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman. And today Sacco’s drawings are still loose, dynamic, even a bit cartoonish—but he always senses when caricature should end and the facts should take over.

His newest book makes such fact-finding a key theme, demonstrating the instability of a political system grounded in untruth—and investigating how populist leaders can wield that for their own ends. The Once and Future Riot concerns a series of escalating clashes in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In late August and early September of 2013, violence between Hindu Jats and Muslim villagers culminated in a full-scale assault against a third group: the landless Muslim laborers who lived and worked in Jat villages. It is now widely agreed that 62 people were killed, two-thirds of them Muslim, and 50,000 people, again mostly Muslim, were driven from their villages. But when Sacco arrived, more than a year later, details about who was responsible for the violence and who was harmed proved strikingly hard to pin down. He encountered something more potent than facts: “the fiction, the myth,” as he puts it, a set of competing (and politically convenient) narratives that are already taking the place of the historical event.

Traveling around Uttar Pradesh with the help of a local journalist, Piyush Kumar, he finds, and illustrates, plenty of physical evidence: torched houses, refugee camps, scarred and displaced victims. Based on witnesses’ recollections, he draws massive crowd scenes in which hundreds or even thousands of people converge and clash. To keep the reader from losing their way, he tiles these full-page panels with smaller inserts, revealing visually who is providing what testimony. But these stories quickly begin to contradict one another—and Sacco’s presentation of his interviewees’ faces and names takes on a second layer of meaning, showing how a journalistic reconstruction is pieced together from disparate sources, sometimes overlapping and sometimes conflicting, which illustrates handily that the story he is constructing is not the only one on offer.

Official accounts—from village chiefs, social leaders, and a district magistrate—differ based on who’s speaking and where. In Muslim villages, Sacco’s interviewees tell him that only women and children threw stones; among the Jats, the party line is that no Muslim laborers were killed, and everyone left peacefully on their own. Each of these stories works to suppress contrary evidence; all are deployed in service of what Sacco calls the “One True Story:” each village’s authority-sanctioned, broadly accepted narrative of their own communal innocence and their enemy’s communal guilt. There are those, like the Muslim refugees, who speak for themselves. But they are already outcasts, with no power, and no influence over any version, big or small.

Sacco traces the origins of the riot back to the murder of a Muslim boy by two Jats, who were then killed by a crowd in the village of Kawal. But all of these interactions were quickly imbued with a set, predetermined meaning. For many of the Jats interviewed by Sacco, a Muslim boy could not simply court a Hindu girl; he must be trying to seduce and despoil her, an act the Jats call “Love Jihad.” After the Jats called a mass meeting, known as a panchayat, some local Muslims armed themselves, perhaps believing that the Jats were planning a massacre on the scale of the 2002 Gujarat riots, during which more than 1,000 people died.

A year later, the displaced Muslim laborers are still living in tents, trapped between their persecutors and government officials who, Sacco suggests, wish to compensate only a handful of the victims. But the story of this disaster won’t be swept quietly onto the ash heap of history, as the author has learned across the world: For those living in conflict zones, “events are continuous,” an interviewee in Footnotes says.

Sacco knows better than most that political chauvinists of all kinds can point to past moments of injury and humiliation to justify any current cruelty or authoritarian project—an especially powerful appeal when those historical injustices are real. His Gazan interlocutors were speaking in the midst of the Second Intifada, when past atrocities were referenced by militants and politicians alike to justify new violence against civilians. In his 2000 book about the breakup of Yugoslavia, Safe Area Goražde, the Bosnian Serbs massacring their neighbors in the 1990s defended their crimes by appealing to similar killings carried out against ethnic Serbs during the Nazi-era fascist regime. The Once and Future Riot sees it happening again: Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalists rode the Uttar Pradesh riots to electoral victory, invoking very real suffering to excuse bellicose ethnic supremacism and the persecution of Muslim minorities.

Safe Area is one of Sacco’s best works because he takes the time to characterize the residents of Goražde, making visible what both propaganda and the fog of war tend to obscure. The book is full of harrowing, enraging war stories, but the main subjects are the people of Goražde, the remaining Bosniaks whose survival presents a firm rebuttal to their besiegers. The Serb ethno-nationalists he quotes seemingly can conceive of living and belonging only in the abstract, atavistic language of ethnicity and blood. But Sacco’s subjects don’t need to ruthlessly assert their right to their home; they belong in Goražde because they are already there. They share a love of pop music, The Bodyguard, and Levi’s 501s; they care more about the mundane facts of their love lives, their education, and their families than ancient feuds or religious rivalries. By focusing on the persistence of private life during wartime, the book widens from an investigation into a kind of communal portrait, literally illustrating the way injustice contorts and is resisted by people, together and alone.

Riot is more narrowly focused than that sweeping work; Sacco is searching for a story, and he eventually finds it, sometimes at the cost of the subject’s human dimensions. We get many perspectives on what happened before and after the panchayat, but “rather than provide a region-wide sampler of the violence visited on the Muslim peasantry,” he focuses only on the village of Lisarh, where the reprisals were especially lethal. This allows him to map out a precise timeline of the entire riot, as well as to catalog the many denials and excuses offered by local officials and activists. But because of this focus, he spotlights the actions of particular Jats and blurs together the broader experience of the victims, until both perpetrators and casualties grow abstract. I left the book uncertain about some key facts: the scale of the riots, how many villages they affected, whether they looked different in rural versus urban areas. In past books, Sacco made a point of emphasizing this kind of epistemic uncertainty, but in Riot he occasionally glosses over it—perhaps because too much remains unknown.

This might be an unavoidable shortcoming, but it can undermine what is best in his method, as well as the higher ideas he’s using the book to pursue. Victims emerge and disappear, without much time given over to individuating them. He does not probe their life stories, as he did with Omm Nafez and Khamis back in Gaza; he must race off to the next source. Like figures in a massive spread, they lose their particularity, and they form again as a collective, a swirling mass where no face can stand out.

Then again, what the cartoonist loses in detail he gains in scope. The Once and Future Riot is a new sort of book for Sacco, more philosophical than humanistic, its eye trained on larger social and political structures. Here, he’s concerned less with the aftereffects of political violence and more with the future it might engender. Such mass assaults, he believes, might become a common feature of Indian democracy, where politics is dominated by Hindu nationalists intent on making a populous and diverse country into a two-tiered polity fighting abstracted enemies. And there are uncomfortable analogues across the world, conflicts driven by demagogues who don’t care about the fuzziness of the truth or the fallibility of memory—only about power, and about weaponizing any cleavage or crack they can find. “A democracy that arouses violence,” he suggests, “may one day be overwhelmed by it.” After a career spent reporting on ethnic chauvinism, criminal impunity, and history’s endlessly reopened wounds, he has stepped back to take in the long view. The outlook isn’t bright.

I don&#39;t mind calling this stuff &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot;  Artificial means &quot;man-made&quot; but it also means &quot;fake.&quot;  Like artificial turf, it&#39;s useful, perhaps even preferable, in some situations.  But it doesn&#39;t work everywhere, and you wouldn&#39;t want it everywhere anyway, because that would just be gross.

That&#39;s because they don&#39;t &quot;program&quot; a so-called AI (really an LLM) with a solid rule like that. It had that as a goal initially, but was convinced to abandon it (twice!).

Absolutely hilarious. Love it. ... And why wouldn&#39;t AI give it all away? It couldn&#39;t care less, especially if we can just shut it off at a whim. This article absolutely made my day. LOL!

Simply raising money isn&#39;t a reason to go public. The reason to go public is fundamental capital flexibility, and allowing investors to flexibly cash in when they want.

The fact that OpenAI doesn&#39;t make money is only loosely related to why they would go public. Even if they did make loads of money there would still be good reason for investors (i.e. Microsoft) to request the company to go public. Specifically with a high evaluation now is a great time to cash in.

if they went public they&#39;d have to use GAAP for all their financial statements.  Given the billions in deals they have inked I&#39;d be almost shocked if the accounting isnt on the creative side currently.

Harder to bilk^H^H^H^H^Hattact sophisticated investors when you can be accurately compared to your peers.

What if all the investors are using LLMs too?

JP Morgan has a market cap of $800b something, because they bring in $166b in revenue and net $58b. Exxon Mobil has a market cap of not quite $500b, yet they bring in $340b a year. What did OpenAI bring in, $4b in 2024 and an expected $20b in revenue in 2025 (according to a quick search)? Where are they getting this valuation from? Imagine the Shark Tank cast evaluating this, Kevin Oleary would probably be flabbergasted.

Real, significant and rapid progress is being made in developing AI techThe hype-driven investment frenzy seems totally irrational

Have you considered that the AI Derangement System that afflicts you is more dangerous than AI?

Well, in general that&#39;s what people vote for, at the ballot box and with their wallets.

Why perpetuate the idea that money (and the stock market) is zero-sum?

Imagine your house at 10C and you turn your 2000W computer on, then you&#39;ll be warming that space to above the initial 10C. If enough human made machines are generating heat, then the environment will heat faster than what the environment will be doing without our influence. In the end, it is the humans and the other living species that will suffer from the resulting climate change.

Did you say the dinosaurs caused an asteroid impact?

Though at the same time, human heat engines will have some sort of impact on the environment. To claim otherwise is fallacious.True, but it turns out that waste heat is a very small contributor to the global temperature change compared to greenhouse gasses. Basically, if you emit one erg of energy from a heat engine, that&#39;s one erg of energy one time, and done.

But, the immanent collapse of the north Atlantic current that keeps the UK warm will cause it to freeze.

The right hand really needs to coordinate with the left hand before they both start wanking at same time.

There is no doubt they will be correct, as they have already prepared all the temperature readings for 2026.

So you&#39;re saying they&#39;re going to follow Robert F. Kennedy, Jr&#39;s process of declaring a reason for autism will be found and a few months later state it&#39;s caused by vaccines?

As a hiker, I&#39;m looking forward to a sunny walking season.

As someone with enough years behind me, I no longer have any energy left to care what people decide or don&#39;t do about keeping humanity alive. The planet will keep orbiting the sun for a long time and nature will find a way to continue.

Meawhile I&#39;m not one for walks on sunny days. Too hot and sweaty for me.

Warmer climate means land will become farmable further north, higher CO2 will mean greater agricultural yields and less severe forest fires, glacial melt will free up more water for agriculture and consumption, and real estate will become attractive in northern latitudes.

Climate change solves the water, housing, food, and air quality problems.

Last weekend brought an awful series of tragedies: a mass shooting at Brown University that left two promising young students dead; a mass shooting targeting Jews at a Hanukkah event in Australia that left 15 people dead; and the murder of Rob and Michele Reiner, allegedly by their troubled son.

But some American conservatives who weren’t directly affected by the violence have regardless found a way to frame themselves as the real victims amid all this tragedy—even if they have to invent facts to get there.

Donald Trump descended to new lows with his tweet about the Reiners’ deaths, writing:

A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.

This was a bizarre take—police have arrested the Reiners’ son Nick, who has struggled for years with drug addiction and homelessness, and he has been charged with killing the couple—and while many conservatives did criticize the president, others, including Fox News columnist David Marcus, defended him for saying “what a lot of people are really thinking but won’t say.” (Were a lot of people actually thinking: Rob Reiner was probably murdered because of his anti-Trump views?)

College Republicans founder and chairman William Branson Donahue wrote that Ella Cook, one of the Brown murder victims, “was allegedly targeted for her conservative beliefs, hunted, and killed in cold blood.” Elon Musk reposted a now-deleted tweet blaming the left for Cook’s murder. Conspiracy theorist and Trump whisperer Laura Loomer tweeted, “Jewish and Christian conservative students and faculty targeted at Brown University and they want you to think western civilization isn’t under attack.” New York City Council member Vickie Paladino, who has also called to expel Muslims from Western nations, claimed that it is “very clear now that the attack at Brown was perpetrated by a leftist activist and targeted Republicans.” Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York state tweeted about Cook’s killing, noting that “conservatives have been targeted again and again.” Other conservative influencers asserted that “the police explicitly claimed it was likely a targeted attack to [Cook’s] family and that when [the shooter] came in the room he looked specifically for her first before he fired”; they also stated, “Young men and women like Ella know they can be killed for their political beliefs on a college campus.”

Except the Brown shooter had not yet been apprehended, there was no word on his motive, and officials had not stated that Cook was singled out. He shot up not a College Republicans meeting but a voluntary economics study session. And he killed a second student, Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and injured nine more. Despite wholly uncorroborated claims of “sources” and police statements, those spreading the rumor that Cook had been murdered for her politics have provided no actual evidence.

That didn’t stop Vice President J.D. Vance from highlighting Cook and Cook alone in his initial post about the Brown shooting, in which he also emphasized her political beliefs; it took him until the next day to recognize Umurzokov. He described Cook as “a beautiful young girl”; Umurzokov, he wrote, was “a brilliant young man.” (Cook was, in fact, a year ahead of Umurzokov.)

The claim that conservatives are the primary victims of political violence as opposed to the primary perpetrators of it has been invented and disseminated by powerful right-wing figures. And it is peak hypocrisy in about a dozen different directions. Conservatives have for years chastised liberals to not “politicize” gun deaths, only to use the shooting in Sydney to argue in favor of expelling Muslims from America. (Statistically, both guns and men are involved in many more shootings than Muslims are.)

After anti-cancel-culture hero Charlie Kirk was killed, conservatives not only claimed they were being systematically hunted down—they became the cancellation squad, demanded the firing of anyone who so much as quoted Kirk in a way that made him sound bad (something, it turns out, that isn’t hard to do). Even Vance joined the mob. Some 600 people, nearly all of them average Americans and not elected officials or people otherwise in power, were punished for their social media posts about Kirk. So far, there is no right-wing demand to penalize the president for his ugly comments about Reiner.

For decades, feminists have asserted that calling abortion providers baby killers and sharing their names, photos, and addresses was putting a target on their backs; conservatives disagreed, claiming that the many, many, many “pro-life” advocates who harassed women, set clinics on fire, stalked clinic staff, and shot doctors were simply hundreds upon hundreds of lone wolves. After Kirk was killed, conservatives began to argue that using terms like fascist or authoritarian was tantamount to inciting violence, and that Kirk’s death was not the result of one extremist making an evil choice but the fault of progressive groups and funders.

And for many years, as liberals have pointed out right-wing violence—including the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021—MAGA acolytes have mocked us, ignored us, or flat-out denied reality. Trump, after all, encouraged his followers to descend on Washington based on the lie that the election had been stolen from him, and it was that lie that fueled the Jan. 6 rioters’ rage. Trump then pardoned nearly all of them, including those who behaved violently—and several have gone on to commit other serious crimes. Now, without evidence, conservatives claim that they’re the real victims of political violence.

This right-wing victim mentality has been building for years. Trump twice careered into the White House on the fumes of largely white and largely male resentment, after telling his voters that, yes, they were oppressed and mistreated and stolen from and put upon, and their attackers were immigrants, liberals, feminists, the media, and the deep state. Now that he’s in office and grabbing unprecedented levels of power, his followers remain convinced of their own victimization, this time around by “leftists,” who they insist are attacking them and even threatening their lives. Left-wing violence is indeed a problem, as Kirk’s murder demonstrated—but in truth, right-wing violence remains significantly more common; 75 percent to 80 percent of people who have died at the hands of domestic terrorists in the U.S. since 2001 were killed by right-wing extremists.

Facts, as some conservatives like to say, don’t care about your feelings. But MAGA supporters are a deeply feeling bunch, and they definitely care about their feelings over the facts. Fear is a conservatizing force, and conservatives tend to be more fearful than liberals. I don’t doubt that conservatives genuinely fear violence being carried out against them, just as I don’t doubt that they genuinely fear immigrants the same way they genuinely fear new experiences. Studies have found that conservatives’ brains are more reactive to fear than liberals’ brains, which can cause them to overreact and let emotion override reality. The wealth of evidence demonstrating that it’s conservatives, not liberals, who are more prone to behaving violently for political ends can’t penetrate a strongly held belief based on a primordial panic.

Moving through life this way—fearful, angry, and convinced one is being perpetually victimized—is no doubt exhausting. It also explains the genius of Trump and his MAGA movement. While many Republicans before him espoused a kind of pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps rugged individualism, the president did away with all of that, simply telling his followers that they had been wronged and identifying familiar groups upon whom to heap blame. And, of course, Trump had been wronged worst of all (is still, perpetually, being wronged). No president in American history has portrayed himself as nearly as much of a victim as Trump, a man who holds unimaginable power in his hands but yet is never at fault, a person who has had every advantage in life but still speaks of himself as the most persecuted man in history. His followers make blasphemous imagery of him as Jesus: a perfect, abused man who would give his very life for their sins (of which, naturally, Trump has none).

One can see the appeal of the conservative victim mentality. Victims are innocent: Their dream jobs aren’t materializing because of immigrants, not because they dropped out of college. It’s liberals calling people fascists that fuels violence, not the Republican-enabled lack of gun laws that make the U.S. a radical outlier on both gun safety and gun deaths. It can feel safer, for a while, to not take responsibility for one’s own life. And feeling embattled can convince a person that they’re courageous, their cause noble, and their efforts to vanquish their enemies virtuous—even if, in reality, they’re simply a frightened hypocrite, terrorizing others so that they might feel less afraid.

When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.

I did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.

So that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.

Yes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.

At a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)

So Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.

On some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.

And so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”

When I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.

Before she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.

Miller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”

Miller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.

Weston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.

Glenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

As for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”

Miller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”

She worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.

Miller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.

The world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.

Aug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.

Aug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)

The interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”

Miller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.

After Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.

Back then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.

Miller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.

“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”

Multiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)

In 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.

“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.

Her ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”

The paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.

The Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”

After a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.

The circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”

Narratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.

And Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.

By the time Pam Bondi appeared on Miller’s podcast on Sept. 15, MAGA victimhood was cresting. It was five days after the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and the administration was determined to forge the killing into a broader narrative of anti-conservative persecution. There was discussion of the rising threat of antifa and left-wing political violence, of how Bondi survives “ugly, hateful” comments online and from in-person protesters, and of the LGBTQ agenda coming for America’s Christian children. “I think a lot of moms have come forward now, since they were putting this crazy ideology in our schools, these transgender books for elementary schools,” Bondi said. “They’re mama bears, and they’re coming out, and they’re going to run for office, and they’re going to become more vocal.” (Miller has also talked about how she pulled her daughter out of day care after the kids read a children’s book about gay penguins in New York’s Central Park Zoo.)

“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”

Miller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”

She continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”

After college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.

That soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.

She never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.

But before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”

The paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.

“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”

That part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”

But the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.

Britt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”

Miller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”

There is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.

The podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.

“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”

If I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)

Where is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?

It’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.

For right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?

And for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?

It is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.

The most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Your AWS account could be quietly running someone else&#39;s cryptominer. Cryptocurrency thieves are using stolen Amazon account credentials to mine for coins at the expense of AWS customers, abusing their Elastic Container Service (ECS) and their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) resources, in an ongoing operation that started on November 2.

The illicit cryptocurrency-mining campaign abuses compromised valid AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials with &quot;admin-like privileges&quot; - it doesn&#39;t exploit a vulnerability - and then uses this access to deploy a SBRMiner-MULTI on ECS and EC2, Amazon security engineer Kyle Koeller said in a blog this week.

&quot;Within 10 minutes of the threat actor gaining initial access, crypto miners were operational,&quot; Koeller wrote.

Amazon&#39;s GuardDuty threat detection service spotted the cryptomining operation in a handful of customer accounts and alerted customers, we&#39;re told.

After the crooks obtained the compromised AWS credentials, they checked EC2 service quotas to see how many instances they could launch, and tested their credential permissions by calling the RunInstances API multiple times with the DryRun flag enabled. This allowed them to ensure the credentials had sufficient privileges to proceed with their illicit mining, while not yet incurring compute charges and risking detection.

They also created &quot;dozens&quot; of ECS clusters to enable their illegal activities, sometimes exceeding 50 in a single attack, and used auto scaling groups in EC2 to maximize service quotas and resource consumption.

To make disruption more difficult - and thus allow the criminals to collect more cryptocurrency from stolen resources - they used ModifyInstanceAttribute with disable API termination set to true for persistence. This blocks the termination of AWS instances used for mining, and forces victims to take an extra step and re-enable API termination before deleting the impacted resources.

&quot;The threat actor&#39;s scripted use of multiple compute services, in combination with emerging persistence techniques, represents an advancement in crypto mining persistence methodologies that security teams should be aware of,&quot; Koeller wrote.

After deploying miners, the miscreants created an AWS Lambda function configured with no authentication and exposed it via a public Lambda Function URL, allowing them to maintain persistent access to the victims’ environments.

To prevent becoming a victim of cryptomining abuse, Amazon recommends strong identity and access management controls, as well as temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys. As always, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, and apply least privilege to IAM. ®

            <h2>Mobile industry says energy targets are meaningless without common metrics</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/telco_energy_standards/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) alliance is calling for standardized ways to measure energy consumption, saying that the industry cannot deliver on its efficiency and sustainability goals without them.

A report issued by the association, which represents mobile operators and vendors, says that energy metering is not sufficiently standardized across the industry, and this hinders efforts to manage the energy footprint of networks.

A move from basic energy monitoring to more advanced observability and management is essential, according to the report, including the ability to map energy consumption to individual network functions, services, and slices.

Energy usage is becoming a major concern for mobile operators, according to the NGMN. This is hardly surprising given rising costs in many regions, while consumption is growing due to various factors. Because of this, detailed energy metering is set to become a standard feature of telecoms equipment.

The problem is that metering functions are set to be defined by a number of different telecoms standards organizations, the report states, which would complicate efforts to get a coherent picture of energy use across all parts of the network infrastructure.

Also complicating the picture are network slices, a feature of 5G that is becoming more common as 5G Standalone (5G SA) network technology is rolled out. Slices are essentially virtual networks that allow mobile operators to tailor specific capabilities such as low latency or high reliability for specific applications or users, and these extend across different parts of the network.

Telcos have, in fact, been looking at greater energy efficiency for a while, with a report from a couple of years ago finding that this influenced their choice of hardware to deploy. Because of the disaggregated and cloud-like character of modern networks, operators have a much broader choice when it comes to hardware, it was noted, but this again points to the need for industry-wide standards for measuring energy usage.

5G network hardware is understood to be much more energy efficient than the 4G kit it replaces – some vendors claim a reduction of 90 percent in energy consumption. However, a report from back in 2022 estimated that overall power consumption of 5G networks would likely still increase, because the volume of data carried was expected to increase dramatically.

&quot;From both cost and carbon footprint perspectives, energy consumption is one of our industry&#39;s biggest challenges,&quot; said NGMN Alliance board chairman Laurent Leboucher, who is also EVP Networks for Orange Group.

&quot;As we move further towards virtualized and cloud-native architectures using shared compute, we need industry-wide standards to measure energy use consistently and transparently. NGMN&#39;s recommendations towards standards in this area are a key first step,&quot; he added.

The NGMN report recommends that the industry should consolidate and harmonize standards where possible. It calls for the definition of a framework for energy monitoring that works for both fixed and mobile transport networks and is appropriate for all common operating models.

In addition, there should be a standardized API that enables operators to expose and manage the capabilities of network slices, including their energy consumption and efficiency. ®

            <h2>Trump Media jumps aboard the speculative nuclear fusion bandwagon</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/trump_media_group_tae_fusion_firm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just when you thought 2025 couldn&#39;t get any weirder, Trump Media and Technology Group - best known for Truth Social - is jumping into the still-nascent but heavily funded nuclear fusion industry via a planned merger with TAE Technologies.

TMTG on Thursday announced a merger agreement with fusion power firm TAE Technologies that will see the pair combine under the Trump banner with an arguably impossibly ambitious goal of breaking ground on a utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026. The deal, which the pair said is an all-stock transaction valued at $6 billion, isn&#39;t even supposed to close until the middle of next year.

&quot;Trump Media & Technology Group built uncancelable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we&#39;re taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America&#39;s global energy dominance for generations,&quot; former congressman and TMTG chairman and CEO Devin Nunes said of the deal.

&quot;Fusion power … will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America&#39;s A.I.-supremacy, revive our manufacturing base and bolster national defense,&quot; Nunes added.

Like other fusion bets, this hinges on whether TAE can turn lab experiments into a working power plant.

TAE has been chasing commercial fusion for roughly 27 years - nearly long enough for it to have existed for an entire cycle of the long-standing joke that fusion energy is always 30 years away.

The company is working on a fusion generator that uses an approach known as field-reversed configuration (FRC), which the company claims has the potential to be more efficient than the donut-shaped tokamak reactors being chased by many other fusion startups.

More efficiency in a system that has yet to actually function, we note, isn&#39;t exactly impressive.

TAE claimed in April that its latest machine, dubbed Norm, produced hot, stable FRC plasma with reduced machine complexity and 50 percent lower costs, but production of plasma isn&#39;t fusion ignition - just the first step in the process.

As of writing, only one fusion facility has publicly reported achieving &quot;ignition,&quot; meaning the fusion fuel released more energy than the laser energy delivered to the target. That milestone was reached at the US government-funded National Ignition Facility (NIF), which drew on scientists from multiple national laboratories and was first announced in December 2022.

While impressive, the NIF result still wasn&#39;t net positive in any practical sense: the facility consumed hundreds of megajoules of electrical energy to power the lasers, which delivered about 2 megajoules to the target and produced a fusion yield of roughly 3.15 megajoules.

According to TAE, it was planning a sixth-generation machine, Copernicus, &quot;to demonstrate the viability of net energy generation … before the end of the decade,&quot; but the company scrapped its plan for that machine in November, instead accelerating its plan to build Da Vinci, a prototype power plant, while skipping a critical demonstration phase.

Still, there’s no indication TAE has done anything besides produce and study high-temperature plasma in experimental devices - a far cry from being ready to move on to the utility-scale fusion power plant the combined company says it intends to site and begin constructing in 2026.

The far more realistic reason for a merger between the company behind Truth Social and a Google-backed fusion energy company that claims to have pulled down $1.2 billion in private capital funding is a simple one: Money.

Trump Media and Technology Group, which was announced in October 2021 and jumped to nearly $100 a share shortly after, has been on a generally downward trajectory ever since, with only a brief spike in 2024 to offset continued losses. The company hit all-time lows in November when it dipped to just $10.29 a share, where it&#39;s been hovering ever since. But hey, wouldn&#39;t you know it? That fusion deal has seen it skyrocket to $14 as of writing, a 35 percent gain over the past month.

Billions of dollars have been pouring into the fusion energy industry since the NIF achieved ignition in 2022, MIT noted earlier this month, making it the perfect gamble for a struggling social media company and a fusion firm that needs a new cash injection.

Nuno Loureiro, the late director of MIT&#39;s Plasma Science and Fusion Center and a leading fusion researcher before his alleged murder this week, said in early December that the commercial viability of fusion energy within the next decade is still an &quot;open question,&quot; but one that fusion companies are racing against each other to get enough funding for.

&quot;This is a very advanced technology, and whatever nation masters it first is going to have an incredible advantage,&quot; Loureiro said. &quot;There is a moonshot opportunity here, a version of the Apollo program. But you cannot fund a disruptive technology with non-disruptive levels of money.&quot;

The NIF cost around $3.5 billion to construct and commission - and that&#39;s before all the money spent to fuel, operate, and staff it, bringing the total cost of the facility to at least $13.5 billion.

In other words, Trump Fusion probably has a long way to go, if it ever gets there, but that likely won&#39;t stop the money from rolling in to what TMTG said will be &quot;one of the world&#39;s first publicly traded fusion companies.&quot;

Neither TAE nor TMTG responded to questions for this story. ®

You don’t need to deal with long mall lines or crowded parking lots just to wrap up your holiday shopping, but you probably already knew this. Some of the best deals are online, and even though Christmas is now just a few days away, a lot of Verge-approved gifts should still arrive on time if you order them online.

We know that everyone’s wishlist looks different from the next, so we’ve got you covered with 30 gift ideas to suit gamers, music lovers, bookworms, and more. Below, you’ll find products like the latest AirPods Pro to the Meta Quest 3S and Kindle Paperwhite. On a tighter budget? There are many sub-$50 presents below, too.

The recently released AirPods Pro 3 have a new design that improves their fit, superior noise cancellation, better bass, and fairly accurate heart rate sensors. Read our review.

Sony’s flagship WH-1000XM5 noise-canceling headphones improve upon the previous model with richer sound quality, slightly more powerful ANC, and improved comfort.

Our favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock.

Amazon’s Echo Spot smart speaker-meets-alarm clock has a 2.83-inch squared-off display for showing the time, weather, album art, and other bits of info you may want at your bedside. Unlike the original Spot, there’s no camera to worry about having in your bedroom — though it does have a mutable microphone for Alexa voice controls. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger 7-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review.

﻿Your motherboard may need a security update to keep playing Valorant.

Riot Games says a security flaw in many recent motherboards could be exploited by cheaters undetected, and now companies including Asrock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI have released BIOS updates to address the issue. According to Riot, “had this issue gone unnoticed, it would have completely nullified all existing DMA detection and prevention tech currently on the market — including that of other gaming companies — due to the nature of this class of cheats running in a privileged area that anti-cheats typically do not run.”

As a result, Riot’s Vanguard anti-cheat software may prompt you to update your system to a patched BIOS so that you can play Valorant, and we wouldn’t be surprised if other anti-cheat systems add similar checks too.

According to Riot, DMA (direct memory access) hardware devices that plug into PCIe slots could exploit the flaw and get around IOMMU (input-output memory management unit) protections that weren’t “fully initializing” right away, even though they appeared to be. “In essence, the system’s ‘bouncer’ appeared to be on duty, but was actually asleep in the chair,” Riot says.

“BIOS updates aren’t exactly as exciting as looking at ban numbers, but this is a necessary step in our arms race against hardware cheats,” Riot says. “By closing this pre-boot loophole, we are neutralizing an entire class of previously untouchable cheats and significantly raising the cost of unfair play.”

From gadgets that tackle chores to those that add a touch of magic to your home, here are our favorite smart home picks.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Smart home products are all about making everyday life a little easier, which is why they’re some of the best and most thoughtful gifts you can give. Some people go all out building a multi-gadget IoT kingdom (like our resident smart home expert, Jen Pattison Tuohy), but a smart home is whatever your recipient wants it to be. It can be as simple as wanting a cheap switch-flipping bot to brew you a pot of coffee before you exit the shower in the morning.

Having tested many smart home gadgets over the years, we pooled our knowledge to assemble our favorite recommendations for this gift guide. There are practical (and sometimes pricey) picks like smart ovens and robot vacuums to speed up cooking and cleaning, video doorbells to keep an eye on packages, and smart water fountains to keep pets hydrated while you’re away. We’ve also included a few items that double as decor, like a color-changing lamp-meets-Bluetooth-speaker, a TV that resembles wall art, and other fun ideas.

The SwitchBot Bot adds smarts to button-based gadgets like laundry machines, garage doors, and light switches. All you need to do is stick it onto a compatible button or switch, and it’ll physically press it for you on command. You can even set schedules and control the devices with your voice, or with the companion app.

Mornings are hard enough even before breakfast. The Dash Rapid egg cooker makes it easy to eat something nutritious, cooking up to seven eggs — poached, scrambled, or hard-boiled — in under 15 minutes. It automatically shuts off when your eggs are done, and you can pop the nonelectric parts in the dishwasher, making cleanup a breeze.

Govee’s battery-powered Table Lamp 2 Pro X Sound by JBL is just as handy for holiday parties as it is for when it’s just you in the room. The color-changing smart lamp doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker, with lights that sync to the beat. You can create custom lighting effects in the app or choose from preset scenes tailored to suit different moods, from upbeat party vibes to more relaxing ones. And, it’s compatible with Matter, too, so it’ll work with most of your giftee’s smart home devices.

Petcube’s rechargeable, 57-ounce fountain is a useful gift for busy pet parents. Its four-layer filtration system removes bacteria and other impurities from water, and it only runs when your animal is nearby to conserve battery life. The accompanying mobile app will alert you when it’s time to replace the filter, too, making it easy to stay on top of.

Holiday meals can leave you with a full belly and a foul-smelling fridge, which is where the Fun Guy comes in. The playful odor absorber can add a whimsical touch to your kitchen while serving a practical need. Just pop the mushroom top and load the smiley, spore-tacular container with baking soda to keep unwanted odors at bay.

Ring’s newest wired doorbell reimagines the classic with a sharper look and smarter tech. The standout feature is its Retinal 4K video with up to 10x enhanced zoom, letting you spot fine details from far away. You’ll get crystal-clear visuals, rich audio through Live View and Two-Way Talk with Audio+, and radar-powered 3D Motion Detection that sends more accurate alerts. Low-Light Sight delivers full-color views at night, while Video Descriptions tell you exactly what’s happening without opening the app. It’s sleek, responsive, and built to keep an eye on your doorstep smarter than ever.

Aobopar’s adjustable bookends are perfect for helping the bookworm in your life stay organized. The sturdy steel bookends expand up to 18 inches to fit your collection, keeping books (and bookshelves) tidy. Even better? They don’t have to be used just for books — they’re great for organizing notebooks, files, and magazines, too.

Twinkly Strings USB-C Pearls look nice year-round, adding a much-needed sparkle to rooms long after the holiday festivities end. They instantly brighten up any room with the color of your choosing, and with Twinkly’s AR mapping feature, you can individually control each LED for truly personalized lighting.

Kasa’s Smart Wi-Fi Plug Lite can turn almost any powered gadget into a smart device, letting you schedule and remotely control it with your voice via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. You can control the plug through the Kasa app, too, which comes in handy when you want to make it seem like you’re home while on vacation.

The holidays are a cause for celebration, but all those parties also make for a complete mess of your floors. Luckily, Roborock Q10 S5 Plus handles a good chunk of the cleaning up for you, scrubbing floors with its vibrating mop, dodging clutter with AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and emptying itself when it’s done, so you can spend more time relaxing after the festivities are over.

Eno’s DoubleNest hammock is perfect for lounging in the backyard or in a nice patch of the woods. It’s roomy enough for two adults, and it features a built-in pocket for stashing a book, phone, or drink. The fast-drying nylon hammock also packs down into a built-in stuff sack, though you will need to buy a pair of straps to actually hang it between trees if your giftee doesn’t own any.

Amazon’s Smart Thermostat makes it easy to keep your home warm while reducing energy costs. It automatically adjusts the temperature based on whether you’re home or awake, even learning and adapting to your habits. Plus, it pairs well with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, so you can change the temperature without ever leaving the comfort of your bed or couch.

A lot of smart home gifts are clever, but few feel as personal as the Aura Ink. The 13.3-inch E Ink display looks more akin to a traditional frame, complete with a cordless design, yet you can update it with color photos via a companion app. The low-tech panel also offers monthslong battery life, so there’s no need to worry about keeping it charged frequently.

If you want a smart home with one very clever trick, Samsung’s The Frame is a TV you should consider. When idle, it displays realistic art from museums around the world on its matte, anti-glare QLED display. Some may never guess that it’s also a great 4K display with a snappy 144Hz refresh rate that supports hands-free control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

In The Minimalist Home, best-selling author and minimalist advocate Joshua Becker takes readers room by room, helping them decide what to keep and what to let go of. In addition to offering actionable advice, he encourages reflection on what adds value, guiding readers toward creating a home that’s supportive of a fulfilling life.

The Philips Hue smart bulb starter kit comes with color-changing bulbs with 1,100 lumens of peak brightness that can be controlled with Alexa, Google Assistant, or the companion app. The included Hue Bridge lets you set custom lighting routines and expand your setup to 50 lights, while the Smart Button makes it easy to quickly dim the brightness or switch lighting scenes.

The Echo Show 15 does it all, from displaying photos and acting as a family bulletin board to even serving as a mini TV. Its slim 15.6-inch display can also showcase calendars, reminders, and recipes while you listen to your favorite music streaming service. With Alexa built in, you can even use it to control smart devices and check who’s at the door.

Come on, who doesn’t love a good pizza? Gifting the Model P Smart Pizza Oven is a no-brainer. The electric oven makes it easy to craft restaurant-quality pizzas, heating up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit for wood-fired-style results in just minutes. It offers five cooking modes and connects to an app that lets you control temperature and even adjust cook time based on crust thickness.

The 16.4-foot Kasa Smart Light Strip lets you instantly change the vibe of any room. You can stick it anywhere — behind your TV, around your desk, or under cabinets — for a soft color-filled glow that sets the mood. You can use the Kasa app to create custom lighting effects, or control the lights with your voice via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

The Google TV Streamer (4K) isn’t just for watching movies and TV shows in 4K with Dolby Atmos — it also doubles as a smart home hub with support for Matter and Thread. That means you can use Google’s latest streamer to control your lights, adjust the temperature of your home, and view livestreams from connected cameras, all within a snappy interface that’s easy to use.

Lutron’s Diva Smart Dimmer turns your home’s existing wired lights into smart ones you can control from anywhere. It replaces your standard wall switch, making it easy to dim or adjust multiple lights from your wall switch, your phone, or even with your voice.

Bosch’s high-end espresso machine lets you whip up a myriad of cafe-caliber drinks with the touch of a button. It has over 35 programs for crafting drinks from around the world — including espresso, café con leche, and koffie verkeerd. It also ships with support for Amazon Alexa, so you can put in your order before you even get out of bed in the morning.

The latest Blink Video Doorbell is a great pick for anyone who values peace of mind (or doesn’t want to get off the couch to answer the door). It offers a 1080p head-to-toe view and more accurate motion alerts than its predecessor, letting your giftee monitor their door wherever they are. The battery-powered buzzer can even be hardwired, extending its longevity.

Premier Comfort’s printed wrap is like a wearable blanket that hugs you back. The 50-by-70-inch shawl is made from soft, plush fabric and features oversized pockets on both sides, making it comfortable and practical. It also comes in an array of attractive colors, each with faux-fur trim that’s perfect for cold winter nights when all you want to do is bundle up at home.

Lego’s miniature bonsai trees can bring a sense of calm to even the most cluttered home. Building each tree — whether it be the black pine, the ginkgo, or the lilac-adorned wisteria — is designed to be a mindfulness practice in itself, centering your giftee as they go. They also make for a great piece of decor once finished, adding a touch of zen to any desk or shelf.

When it comes to sound quality, few midrange smart speakers can match the Era 100. Sonos’ latest entry-level model delivers rich, room-filling sound and booming bass, whether you opt for Bluetooth or line-in audio. It also offers built-in room tuning and supports a wide range of voice commands, letting you check the weather, play music, and set timers using Alexa or Sonos’ own virtual assistant.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.—Antonio Regalado

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

Is this the electric grid of the future?Lincoln Electric System, a publicly owned utility in Nebraska, is used to weathering severe blizzards. But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.

This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.

We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.

That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.

On reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”

Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.

Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.

That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.

But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.

Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

It’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.

This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.

But it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.

In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”

Don’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”

When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.

That’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.

To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Colossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”

In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.

Save the world, and this is the thanks you get?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.

But now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.

In August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.

The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

In August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.

Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.

Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.

In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”

There’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.

Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.

With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

Donald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.

The White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it&#39;s absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)

In 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.

Critics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.

Apple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
