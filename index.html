            <h2>Godlike Titan threatens humanity in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters S2 trailer</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/02/meet-the-new-tentacled-titan-x-in-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-s2-trailer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Apple TV released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (kaiju) created by Toho Co., Ltd into a shared narrative. But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: it’s a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it.

As previously reported, the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official Season 2 premise:

Season two will pick up with the fate of Monarch—and the world—hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong’s Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe—all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

In addition to Russell, returning cast members include Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt) as the younger Shaw; Anna Sawai as Cate Randa; Kiersey Clemons as May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa; Joe Tippett as Tim; Elisa Lasowski as Duvall; and Anders Holm playing the younger version of Monarch researcher Bill Randa. Takehiro Hira, Amber Midthunder, Curtiss Cook, Cliff Curtis, Dominique Tipper, and Camilo Jiménez Varón will join the S2 cast as guest stars.

The full trailer opens with our plucky team realizing that whatever kaiju is causing the latest havoc isn’t Kong, or Godzilla, but something even bigger. And it has massive tentacles that the kaiju uses to wrap around a manned boat and drag it down to the ocean depths. Cate blames herself for pressing the button that opened the rift, thereby unleashing this new menace on humankind. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk, so our only hope is to call on Kong and Godzilla, according to Shaw, because “to destroy a monster takes another monster.” But they might just make things worse. At least we get to see a roaring Kong deliver a powerful punch to the new Titan’s face.

The second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres on Apple TV on February 27, 2026. New episodes will be released every Friday through May 1, 2026. And the MonsterVerse is still expanding: Apple TV recently greenlit a spinoff prequel series featuring Wyatt Russell’s younger Shaw, set during the Cold War.

            <h2>Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI deal has seemingly vanished</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/five-months-later-nvidias-100-billion-openai-investment-plan-has-fizzled-out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “Even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with other senior leaders as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for six gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.</div>

            <h2>Newborn dies after mother drinks raw milk during pregnancy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/newborns-death-spurs-raw-milk-warning-in-new-mexico/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newborn baby has died in New Mexico from a Listeria infection that state health officials say was likely contracted from raw (unpasteurized) milk that the baby’s mother drank during pregnancy.

In a news release Tuesday, officials warned people not to consume any raw dairy, highlighting that it can be teeming with a variety of pathogens. Those germs are especially dangerous to pregnant women, as well as young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.

“Raw milk can contain numerous disease-causing germs, including Listeria, which is bacteria that can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or fatal infection in newborns, even if the mother is only mildly ill,” the New Mexico Department of Health said in the press release.

The health department noted that it could not definitively link the baby’s death to the raw milk the mother drank. But raw milk is notorious for transmitting Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. The Food and Drug Administration has a “Food Safety for Moms-to-Be” webpage about Listeria, in which it poses the question and answer: “How could I get listeriosis? You can get listeriosis by eating raw, unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized milk products… .”

Listeria is a particular danger during pregnancy. When exposed, pregnant people are 10 times more likely to develop a Listeria infection than other healthy adults because altered immune responses during pregnancy make it harder to fight off infections. Further, Listeria is one of a few pathogens that are able to cross the placental barrier and infect a developing fetus.

The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists warns patients that if babies survive getting infected during pregnancy, they may be born with “serious infections of the blood or brain.”

“Listeriosis can cause lifelong health problems for your baby, including intellectual disability, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or problems with the brain, kidneys, or heart,” ACOG warns. “Listeriosis can also cause death in newborns.”

While a Listeria infection during pregnancy is one specific risk of raw milk, health officials warn that raw milk can cause serious, potentially life-threatening infections in anyone. Without pasteurization—a process of briefly heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill germs—milk and dairy products can also contain Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Brucella, and Salmonella, among other pathogens.

Still, the unsanitary dairy has grown in popularity among devotees of the wellness industry, including those in the Make America Healthy Again movement. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has personally endorsed drinking raw milk and, prior to taking up the position, claimed he would end the FDA’s “war on public health,” including its “aggressive suppression” of raw milk.</div>

            <h2>X office raided in France's Grok probe; Elon Musk summoned for questioning</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/x-office-raided-in-frances-grok-probe-elon-musk-summoned-for-questioning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French law enforcement authorities today raided X’s Paris office and summoned Elon Musk for questioning as part of an investigation into illegal content. The Paris public prosecutor’s office said the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating Holocaust-denial claims and sexually explicit deepfakes.

Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the “investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.” Europol’s cybercrime center provided “an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.” The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.

French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok’s praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.

The office of Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau said today that the potential crimes being investigated include complicity in possession and distribution of pornographic images of minors; infringement of personal image rights via sexual deepfakes; denial of crimes against humanity; fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system; falsification of the operation of an automated data processing system; and operation of an illegal online platform by an organized group.

We contacted X today and will update this article if it provides any comment. The company criticized the investigation at an earlier stage, alleging in July 2025 that France was conducting “a politically motivated criminal investigation into X” that “threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech.”

X said in July 2025 that it was “in the dark” over what specific allegations it faced related to manipulation of the X algorithm and fraudulent data extraction. X said it would not comply with France’s request for access to its recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.

The Paris prosecutor’s office today said the investigation is taking a “constructive approach” with the goal of ensuring that X complies with French laws “insofar as it operates on national territory.” In addition to Musk and Yaccarino, the prosecutor’s office is seeking interviews with X employees about the allegations and potential compliance measures.

Separately, UK communications regulator Ofcom today provided an update on its investigation into Grok’s generation of sexual deepfakes of real people, including children. Ofcom is “gathering and analyzing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law” and is “progressing the investigation as a matter of urgency,” it said. Ofcom is not currently investigating xAI, the Musk company that develops Grok, but said it “continue[s] to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses.”

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, said today it opened a formal investigation into X regarding the “processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”

“We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children,” the ICO said. “The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”</div>

Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.

The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”

That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.

As for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).

The huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.

Nintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chromebooks debuted 16 years ago with the limited release of Google’s Cr-48, an unassuming compact laptop that was provided free to select users. From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google’s shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.

The documents were filed as part of Google’s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company’s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.

As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta’s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.

Google’s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a pandemic-era bump as workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets.

The documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that’s not counted from the date of purchase—Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The “timeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,” says the filing.

From the start, the ChromeOS experience was focused on the web. Google initially didn’t even support running local apps, but little by little, its aspirations grew. Over the years, it has added Linux apps and Android apps. And it even tried to get Steam games running on Chromebooks—it gave up on that last one just recently. It also tried to shoehorn AI features into ChromeOS with the Chromebook Plus platform, to little effect.

Android was barely getting off the ground when ChromeOS began its journey, but as we approach the 2030s, Google clearly wants a more powerful desktop platform. Android has struggled on larger screens, but Aluminium is a long-running project to fix that. Whatever we see in 2028 may not even look like the Android we know from phones. It will have many of the same components under the hood, though.

Google could get everything it wants with the upcoming Aluminium release. When running on powerful laptop hardware, Android’s performance and capabilities should far outstrip ChromeOS. Aluminium is also expected to run Google apps like Chrome and the Play Store with special system privileges, leaving third-party apps with fewer features. That gives Google more latitude in how it manages the platform and retains users, all without running afoul of recent antitrust rulings.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veteran NASA astronaut Don Pettit returned from his 220-day mission on board the International Space Station in April 2025, the day of his 70th birthday, making him the oldest active astronaut on the space agency’s roster.

During his seven-month stint on board the aging orbital outpost, his fourth trip to space, Pettit took the time to photograph some dazzling views of the Earth below.

On October 20, 2024, he took a stunning picture of an airplane that was passing by at cruising altitude hundreds of miles below him, a perspective only a handful of people get to enjoy. The plane was likely at around 7.5 miles in altitude, while the ISS orbits the Earth at around 250 miles.

But a moderator at the r/aviation subreddit didn’t look too kindly on the shot after Pettit posted it to the forum over the weekend, deeming it too “blurry” and taking it down as a result. According to a circulating screenshot posted by a user who first brought attention to the takedown, the mod team pointed to the subreddit’s rules to justify its decision, which state that “all blurry or low quality pictures are removed.”

The controversial decision kicked off a heated discussion — and prompted an interjection by a different moderator.

“We brought some new people onto the mod team and unfortunately there are some Learning curves,” the moderator wrote, apologizing for the takedown. “I caught the issue and fixed it. Thanks to everyone who let me know that this happened.”

“I’d say the quality of the picture is pretty dang good considering that it’s from about 250 miles away,” the mod added in a separate apology addressed to Pettit directly.

A quick perusal of Pettit’s submissions to Reddit shows several other fascinating vantage points from the ISS, from atmospheric distortion of the Moon that makes it appear squashed to the Milky Way glinting behind the Earth at night. Another long exposure shows the trails left behind by SpaceX’s Sun-reflecting Starlink satellites.

Other Reddit users were far more impressed than the mod who pulled the post down.

“Can’t believe I got flexed by someone on ISS,” one user wrote.

“Tower, can we get a speed check?” another user joked. (The ISS orbits the Earth at a ground speed of 17,100 mph, while an average passenger jet travels at around 500 to 700 mph, depending on conditions.)

Nonetheless, many users on the subreddit were left with a bad taste in their mouths, with one user describing the unfortunate takedown as “Reddit in a nutshell, baby!” — in an apparent reference to the often-pedantic nature of the people who moderate niche interest subreddits.

“Dear mods, please show NASA how to take better pictures from space so you don’t have to delete them,” the user, who initially raised the issue, wrote.

“What a joke,” another user mocked. One of the most epic pics of aviation from the coolest possible place from an actual astronaut.”

“‘This post breaks our rules,&#39;” they added. “Give me a break, man.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, the United States stock market has been a juggernaut on the international stage. The US dollar has been — and still is — the de facto currency globally.

But for how much longer that will be the case is now looking uncertain. As the New York Times reports, investors are starting to look elsewhere as the Trump administration continues to threaten the independence of its central bank, start a trade war with Europe, and implement self-conflicting monetary policies. As a result of it all, the US dollar continues to weaken, making foreign investments in Europe and Asia far more lucrative.

Meanwhile, Wall Street continues to make enormous bets on artificial intelligence, a highly risky gambit, as tech companies still have plenty to prove and a return still appears to be many years out. The AI boom has sent tech company valuations soaring: the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) now account for just over a third of the entire S&P 500, with experts warning that the industry could be propping up a rough-looking US economy.

The International Monetary Fund warned that the weakening hype surrounding AI could be among the biggest risks to global economic growth, noting that if expectations about AI turn out to be too optimistic, a market correction could send shockwaves across global markets.

President Donald Trump’s nomination for the next chair of the central banking system, Kevin Warsh, appeared to do little to stop the continued weakening of the US dollar, which hit a four-year low last week. The Euro and British pound saw their values soar when measured against the US dollar this year.

Trump —also a huge AI booster, underlining the circular nature of the whole situation — celebrated the weakening dollar, arguing it would make products more affordable, in comments that alarmed investors. Officials had to step in to smooth things over, the NYT reported, arguing that despite Trump’s comments, the US government still supports a strong dollar.

Whether Wall Street’s enormous appetite for AI continues to be a weakening economy’s saving grace, for how long remains to be seen. Investors are sending a clear signal: riskier bets are no longer a hot commodity, as demonstrated by the recent plummet in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Instead, historically safer bets like gold are proving far more lucrative, reaching record highs of $5,500 an ounce in January. Despite a massive drop last week, gold is trading 70 percent higher year over year, indicating investors are seriously on edge.

            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The city’s tech scene is reeling as U.S. immigration agents have escalated their crackdown in Minneapolis, killing several people, including at least two U.S. citizens.

Eight Minneapolis-based founders and investors told TechCrunch that they have put much of their work on hold and now spend their days focused on their communities, volunteering at churches, and helping buy food. It’s part of a grassroots effort, across race and class, that is seeing people speak out, donate money, protest, and offer emotional support to one another.

“There’s a lot of commonality between how a teacher is reacting right now and how a tech professional is reacting,” Scott Burns, an investor in the area, told TechCrunch. He said people are “very fatigued.” Burns is going to church more often to help pack food to deliver to those too frightened to leave their homes. “It was like what happens after a natural disaster,” he said of the effort.

Burns and other members of the Minneapolis tech industry told TechCrunch that the immigration raids have been very disruptive to their lives, describing a city that has seen itself united in the last several weeks in the face of escalating violence from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

How can building a company remain a focal point when ICE agents appear to be everywhere, plainclothed and armed with military-grade weapons? Federal agents have been seen searching public transportation and prowling around workplaces. They are outside homes and in parking lots. They have been spotted circling schools.

One Black founder, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect members of his staff, said he now carries his passport with him everywhere he goes. He is a U.S. citizen but has seen people of color throughout the city profiled and picked up by ICE and border patrol agents.

“People aren’t exaggerating how hard it has been. It’s hard to focus; it’s been a challenge just navigating even my team through it,” he said.

He recalled a routine phone meeting with a colleague who suddenly fell silent. Lost for words, the colleague said she was watching ICE detain someone in the neighborhood, the same one his mother lived in.

“I had to get off the phone and call my mom to make sure she had her passport on her,” the founder said.

Efraín Torres, a Latino founder, works from home, listening tentatively to the immigration raids that happen in his neighborhood. “You can’t not hear them,” he told TechCrunch. Cars will beep. Protestors whistle alerts. “And if you miss it, you’ll see signs saying, ‘My neighbor was taken by ICE.’”

Officials even perform “citizen checks,” stopping people and asking them to prove immigration status — which the Supreme Court said last year can be done based on details like race or if a person has an “accent.” These checks have been conducted on people performing even mundane tasks, Torres said, like snow-blowing the lawn. He said he’s had a few run-ins himself with ICE, which is why he likes to stay low.

“The line separating me from being a victim of assault is just a chance encounter,” he said, adding that he knew people who were followed by ICE — something others have reported is happening alongside raids.

The Trump administration has escalated its immigration raids throughout the country, though the force deployed in the Twin Cities is especially large, with more than 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge.” ICE and border patrol agents now outnumber local police in Minneapolis almost 3 to 1, Senator Amy Klobucharof Minnesota has said.

The state is home to one of the largest populations of immigrants from Somalia, a group the administration has targeted before. That includes U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, who has sparred with President Trump. Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, has also seen himself targeted by the president, as has the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, whio is also a Democrat.

The surge in immigration enforcement is part of President Trump’s campaign promise to curb illegal immigration, though some argue that Trump has been specifically targeting cities and states that didn’t vote for him. More than 2,000 people have been arrested by ICE in Minnesota since Trump took office last January.

“It’s been difficult,” said one Black investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He, too, is a U.S. citizen and can trace his roots in the country back for a century. Still, living just outside the city, he carries his passport with him just in case.

“Where I go to the gym, they’re in rural Minnesota,” he said, meaning agents aren’t only in the city. “It’s just been a strange time.”

Everyone is doing what they can, however, to help others. This investor, for example, works with founders in college, many of whom are immigrants. He buys them food so they don’t have to risk going to the grocery store themselves. He also tries to work from home, when possible, as do many of the other people TechCrunch spoke with.

“It’s a tense and difficult time on the ground,” Mary Grove, another investor in the area, told TechCrunch.

Investor Reed Robinson, who has also been helping community members financially, said some of his founders with children have created a volunteer system to watch each other’s kids at school or daycare. It’s so common for ICE to detain the daycare staff, he said, adding that ICE agents frequently violate the law and court orders.

“It feels unnecessary, it feels intrusive, it feels like a violation of rights,” Robinson said about the immigration operation.

Like Robinson, many people feel anger beneath the unease and fear.

The emotional toll makes it hard to build, investors and founders said. Torres, for example, said his company now has a no-ride-sharing-app policy. Some of his engineers are on H-1B visas (which the Trump administration has also attacked) and have reported being followed by immigration officials.

“Each time, it was three to four armed men in tactical outfits,” Torres said, adding that he and his wife have spoken about fleeing the state. “They’re inflicting trauma everywhere they go.”

The Minneapolis tech scene is still quite small, with companies raising just over $1 billion in the past few years. There are some notable companies in the ecosystem, such as the fintech Sezzle (now public), the clean water company Rorra, and the medtech Reema. There is an incredible history of innovation, Robinson said. “It’s not going to stop; we’re going to continue to do the work while we figure out this current situation.”

The Twin Cities — Minneapolis and St. Paul — are the headquarters of some of the biggest American companies, such as Target, Optum, Best Buy, UnitedHealthGroup, and General Mills, to name a few. Some founders and investors criticized the leadership of these big companies, mainly for their vague responses to the chaos gripping the cities, even as many of their own employees are detained.

“We haven’t had an adequate response,” one startup investor said.

Sixty top executives from the state signed a statement that called for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” after ICE agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Large companies in the state have also come together to fund millions in grants through the Minneapolis Foundation for businesses impacted by the immigration operation.

But compared to what is happening on a grassroots level, many founders and investors said these actions are not enough. A recent CNBC poll found that a third of the executives they polled have stayed silent because they didn’t find speaking out relevant to the business. Eighteen percent were worried about “backlash from the Trump administration,” while 9% said they were still figuring out how to respond.

“When you see the failure of community institutions to demonstrate any kind of bravery, that’s really where it’s probably most disappointing,” Tim Herby, a local investor, told TechCrunch, calling the past two months heart-wrenching.

Grove, the investor, said her team routinely checks in with others in the community, including her portfolio companies, to ensure they are doing well. She said people are helping each other pay rent, while restaurants are offering free meals. A local tech nonprofit, Minnestar, is set to host a community event to bring people together and discuss next steps.

One Black investor said he found it ironic that today, the police are alongside many people in speaking out against the government, just a few years after people in the city were protesting against them after the murder of George Floyd. It’s a new day-to-day.

Another Black founder, meanwhile, said some of his white friends have started to drive him around the city for safety. He recalls one day sitting in a restaurant chatting with friends, when the television started giving live updates of ICE shooting another person. The mood fell somber, a reminder of how these raids have consumed every moment of life.

“I saw a friend yesterday,” he said. “It was the first time he left the house since New Year’s.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Intel continues to try to turn itself around, its CEO promised that the company will start producing a new type of chip, one that has been made very popular by rival Nvidia.

At the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.

TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.

The project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.

Intel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.

This initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.

While Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.

It’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.

            <div id="article-text">All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal told The Block.

YC’s famous “standard deal” is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch.

Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC partnered with Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain-related companies.

Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry.

            <h2>Homeland Security is trying to force tech companies to hand over data about Trump critics</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/homeland-security-is-trying-to-force-tech-companies-to-hand-over-data-about-trump-critics/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.

In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.

While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a person’s emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.

Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.

Bloomberg reported last week that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called @montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.

The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena without providing an explanation.

The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”

Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.

Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.

When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way.

A new report by The Washington Post on Tuesday found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.

The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended a No Kings rally last year, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment.

Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named in an article about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.

The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.

Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting.

When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.

“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.

Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is unable to produce user data that it does not have to begin with.

The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why European countries and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.

The round, which was announced Tuesday and led by Autopilot Ventures, provided a multimillion-dollar accelerant for the startup as it nears the end of a lengthy Federal Aviation Administration certification process for its flight control system. The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.

Other investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital.

Skyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.

This is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.

That simplicity and ease of operation — a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.

Skyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.

Skyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration. Last year, the FAA granted final design approval for the company’s SkyOS flight control computers. Skyryse must now complete formal flight testing and verification to achieve full certification.

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <h2>Trump Is Doubling Down on All the Wrong Things</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Republicans have had a tough stretch. They were defeated in elections in the fall and find themselves at risk of losing control of one or maybe both chambers of Congress later this year. Their standard-bearer, President Trump, has tumbled in the polls and finds himself underwater on his two signature issues, the economy and immigration. There has been unrest in a major American city, and blood shed by Trump’s federal agents. Republicans’ whispers have grown louder in recent weeks: Trump is distracted; he’s focused on the wrong things; the chaos is hurting us. And then a thunderclap from deep-red Texas: a state-Senate race in a district that Trump won by 17 points just over a year ago flipped by more than 30 points over the weekend and elected a Democrat for the first time since 1978.

Now, that is a bad sign for a party in a midterm year. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick deemed it “a wake-up call,” and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a possible presidential hopeful, acknowledged that “a swing of this magnitude is not something that can be dismissed.” And then, hours later, Trump took to social media with an urgent call to action.

“I have determined,” the president wrote, “that the fastest way to bring The Trump Kennedy Center to the highest level of Success, Beauty, and Grandeur” is to close it for about two years before a “Grand Reopening that will rival and surpass anything that has taken place with respect to such a Facility before.”

Trump has never been much for resets. But right now, despite the political peril his party faces, instead of recalibrating he is doubling down. Consider a few of the stories that have dominated the headlines and cable chyrons over the past month: Anger about the scenes of unrest and violence amid ICE deportation operations in Minnesota? Well, the Trump administration has telegraphed that it would like to carry out a crackdown on Haitians in Ohio next. Concern about brandishing military force after the U.S. removed the leader of Venezuela and then threatened Greenland? Trump has sent an “armada” of warships to the Persian Gulf to intimidate Iran. A sense that the president has lost focus on what got him elected as he takes on vanity projects such as the White House ballroom? Well, he’ll see you that and raise you both the Kennedy Center renovation and the construction of a giant arch that no one seems to want.

Trump has always trusted his gut, and his unorthodox political instincts led to one of the most unlikely victories in American politics in 2016 and then, eight years later, its most improbable comeback. He and his White House continue to preach confidence. But will he be proved wrong this time?

For many Republicans, what happened in Fort Worth and its suburbs was the loudest alarm yet. Republican Leigh Wambsganss lost to Democrat Taylor Rehmet despite significantly outspending him. Early analysis has suggested that Republicans have lost some of the gains they had made with Latino voters. Wins like this one are fueling Democratic dreams of stealing congressional seats held by Republicans in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Maine, and, yes, Texas.

Trump tried to distance himself from the Lone Star State result, telling reporters on Sunday, “I’m not involved with that” (he’d endorsed Wambsganss on Truth Social and urged his supporters to vote for her) and “I’m not on the ballot” (maybe not by name, but MAGA infuses all elections these days). Never before has a president so thoroughly dominated the political landscape and national discourse. That is to Trump’s delight, but it potentially works less well for Republicans who are left to defend a series of unpopular decisions and policies, most notably one that was formerly a strength: the president’s immigration agenda.

Many voters liked his plan to fortify the southern border and deport violent criminals who were in the U.S. illegally. But, pushed by the powerful White House aide Stephen Miller to meet huge daily arrest quotas, the administration’s efforts expanded greatly. ICE’s budget was supercharged and officers began to target migrants who, in many cases, had lived in the country peacefully for years, sometimes even decades, and were valued employees, neighbors, and friends. Polls showed that Americans were souring on the effort even before ICE surged 3,000 officers into Minneapolis. What followed: a series of confrontations that left two Americans—Renee Good and Alex Pretti, both 37 years old—dead at the hands of federal agents. The killings, particularly Pretti’s, seemed to play on loop on television and social media for a nation that was largely stuck indoors during a frigid, stormy January.

Read: It wasn’t Democrats who persuaded Trump to change course in Minnesota

An uproar followed, and even some Republicans (quietly) let it be known that changes were needed. Trump appeared as though he might back down. He held cordial calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (both under investigation by his Department of Justice), banished the incendiary Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, and dispatched Tom Homan, his border czar, to the region in the unlikely role of agent of de-escalation. But within days, Trump began climbing down from his climb-down. He once again blasted the Democratic leaders on social media, suggested that he may add more officers, and blamed the state for fostering the atmosphere of violence. And then yesterday, while on a loyalist’s podcast, Trump declared, “Minnesota is a mess. There’s something in the water up there. I won the state three times but I got no credit for it … It’s a rigged state.” (He lost all three elections there.)

Many in the West Wing believe January 3 was a turning point for Trump’s second term, a moment when a presidency that limped to the finish of 2025 was given a jolt of life. That was the day U.S. forces seized the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a Caracas raid carried out with Hollywood-esque precision. Although questions remain about the operation’s aftermath—including the fate of Venezuela’s oil, the role of the United States in running the country, and whether it improved the lives of any Americans—the overwhelming military success astounded Trump. Even now, a month later, he brings it up unprompted to friends and lawmakers, and even during his call with Walz two weeks ago, much to the governor’s confusion.

Trump seems to have a taste for more. He backed down, at least for now, from his threats to invade Greenland after receiving strong pushback from NATO allies and some Republican leaders (including private calls from Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, a person familiar with the conversations told me). But he has become fixated on Iran. Though diplomatic talks are scheduled this week, Trump has not ruled out a military operation against Tehran—and he has grown enamored with the idea of toppling the Iranian regime, thereby achieving something his predecessors could not, an aide and an outside adviser told me. Like others I spoke with, they did so on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the president’s thinking.

Few Trump supporters, however, cast their ballots for international adventurism and gunboat diplomacy. A number of Republicans and MAGA influencers have urged the president to shift his focus back home and on the elections ahead of their party, not the ones behind them. But the president has only ramped up that rhetoric, celebrating the FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, elections office and calling for Republicans to “nationalize the voting.”

In an attempt to keep the president on track, aides have rolled out events on mortgages and housing prices. A senior administration official told me that a prescription-drug announcement is slated for Thursday. White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has urged the president to focus on the economy and last month promised that Trump, who rarely traveled to rally with his supporters last year, would make one trip a week to campaign for Republicans; Trump dutifully held events in Michigan and Iowa. And he didn’t mock the concept of an affordability crisis every time he talked about it.

The White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the president’s approach, telling me in a statement that he “can walk and chew gum at the same time, and that’s especially true of policy priorities such as immigration and crime that also yield meaningful economic benefits.”

But Trump’s goals remain loftier, and centered on making a permanent imprint on the nation’s capital. His original idea for a White House ballroom abruptly escalated to the complete demolition of the East Wing. His construction spree now seems set to include a triumphal arch, as a gateway to Washington from Arlington National Cemetery. The president suggested that it should be 250 feet tall, which would dwarf the nearby Lincoln Memorial and dramatically alter the city’s low-rise skyline.

Then there’s the Kennedy Center. The performing-arts center, on the banks of the Potomac River, is a grand American stage and home to the National Symphony Orchestra. It’s also the official memorial to a slain president, named by an act of Congress in 1964 to honor John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in Dallas just a few months earlier. It was meant to carry the spirit of a young president who, along with his wife, valued the arts and believed they could inspire a nation.

Yet Trump was jealous. He has long wanted to be embraced by the nation’s cultural elite and biggest stars and has been incensed when he was belittled (or ignored) by them, even after achieving the highest office in the land. He took control of the center’s board last year and then, to the outrage of many, added his own name to the memorial. That caused a number of the acts still on the center’s schedule to withdraw, leaving it with little programming (or maybe no programming at all). Trump abruptly announced on Sunday evening that the Kennedy Center would, as of July, close for approximately two years for renovations, even though it had just gone through a $250 million expansion in 2019. Some fear that the revered building will meet the same fate as the East Wing; Trump told reporters yesterday that the center would not be razed, but then again, that’s what he originally said about the future ballroom site.

Before the closure was announced, the center hosted the premiere of the $40 million documentary Melania, about the first lady. Trump donned a black tie for the event. This week, he also has meetings slated with the leaders of Colombia and Honduras. Not on his schedule? A trip out into the nation he leads.</div>

            <h2>This Is What Putin Thinks of Trump’s Peace Talks</h2>

At about two this morning, the familiar howl of air-raid sirens woke me in the center of Kyiv, followed by the low thuds of anti-aircraft cannons attempting to shoot down Russian drones. The news alerts followed, citing the city’s mayor: Russian strikes had left more than 1,000 apartment buildings without power and heat as temperatures fell below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

Vladimir Putin was not going to miss his chance to use winter as a weapon. In recent weeks, Russian missile strikes have hammered the power grid and neighborhood heating systems, leaving both on the verge of collapse. Last week, President Trump appealed to Putin to pause these attacks for a week, long enough for the cold snap to pass and peace talks to move forward. Putin initially appeared to acquiesce—then launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine’s energy network since the start of the war.

No one I met in Kyiv over the past few days expected anything different. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches the four-year mark this month, Putin’s strategy has shifted to one that stands in blatant violation of the international laws of war, which prohibit the bombing of civilian infrastructure. Ukrainians aptly call it “energy terror,” and its goal is to freeze them into a state of hopelessness and soften them up for capitulation.

That goal, like most of his aims in this war, has remained out of Putin’s reach. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to push for peace on terms that his people can accept, including firm guarantees from the United States and its allies that they would act decisively to stop any future Russian attack. Over the weekend, as Ukraine’s negotiators met with Zelensky to plan for U.S.-mediated talks with the Russians this week in Abu Dhabi, hundreds of people gathered for a daytime rave on the frozen surface of the Kyiv reservoir, dancing, skating, and racing their cars.

The images from this defiant party masked a deepening exhaustion in the capital. “People are really on the edge,” Yana Markova, the principal of a primary school in Kyiv, told me when I visited her yesterday. The city’s schools have largely stopped holding classes this winter, and Markova has turned her building into a temporary shelter, its cafeteria serving thousands of meals to people whose apartments have no gas, water, power, or heat. “People have different reactions to all this,” she said over a cup of chicken soup. “Some point their anger at the Russians for doing this. Some blame our authorities for failing to protect us.”

On January 9, after the first massive attack of the year on Kyiv’s energy system, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, urged residents to leave their homes in search of “alternative sources of power and heat.” Temperatures dropped far below freezing that night, and the impact of the bombing “was the most devastating for the capital’s critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement on social media. In many neighborhoods, people sought shelter in subway stations, shivering as they tried to catch a few hours of sleep on yoga mats and camping chairs.

But the metro system does not extend to all parts of the city. The working-class district of Desnianskyi, home to more than a quarter of a million people, consists mostly of high-rise apartment blocks. The blackouts shut down elevators in those buildings, trapping some elderly residents in their freezing homes.

Yesterday evening, about eight hours before the latest wave of strikes on Kyiv, I went to see the head of the district, Maksym Bakhmatov, on the third floor of its administrative building. The ground floor houses the equivalent of a DMV, where people sat around in bulky coats and woolen scarves, some waiting to register their complaints about the lack of basic services. One man used the room’s relative warmth to take a nap.

Bakhmatov sat in his office in three layers of clothes, bracing for the next barrage of Russian strikes. A former television producer, he made his name as a performer on the same comedy circuit as Zelensky, who appointed Bakhmatov to run the Desnianskyi district in May. The official had little hope for the peace talks Trump initiated last year, because the Kremlin has shown no willingness to respect any calls for a cease-fire. “Putin will not stop,” Bakhmatov told me. “His rockets will not run out this year or next year.”

Though his anger was mostly reserved for the Russians, he also had harsh words for the local government, a sign of the political divisions that have deepened as living conditions in Kyiv become more difficult. “The city has sent us zero generators, zero food,” he said. Federal authorities have stepped in to provide emergency assistance, setting up heated tents and food pantries for people in his district.

Read: Ukraine latest attacks showcase its desperation.

After every bomb that hits the nearby power plant, Bakhmatov follows a frantic routine. He gets a call in the middle of the night, warning him of the impending blackouts. The water in every apartment tower in his district—roughly 800 of them—then needs to be drained from the central heating system before it freezes. Failing to do that within two hours could rupture the pipes inside the walls. It might then take years, he says, for the repairs needed to make the buildings livable again. “They have the same heating system in Russia,” Bakhmatov said. “It was all built in the Soviet Union. Putin knows all its weak spots. He knows exactly where to strike.”

The unfolding catastrophe has long been clear to the people who run Ukraine’s energy sector. In the middle of November, one of its top executives, Maxim Timchenko, traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief U.S. officials and members of Congress. “It’s an absolute disaster,” he told me during that visit. “It’s definitely going to be the worst winter of the war, and there is no solution other than an energy cease-fire. That’s the main message I’m bringing here to all levels.”

As the head of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, Timchenko could see that the Russians had carefully selected their targets to maximize the damage not only to Ukraine’s power grid but to its sense of unity. Throughout the fall, their missile strikes destroyed the substations that move electricity from the nuclear-power plants in the western part of Ukraine to the east, where most of the population and heavy industry are concentrated. “They wanted to divide us down the middle,” Timchenko explained. “And in the electricity space, they succeeded.”

Without high-voltage lines to move power across the country, many parts of western Ukraine saw a surplus of electricity this fall and early winter, while the eastern half of the country experienced blackouts lasting as long as 18 hours a day.

As the strikes continued in January and temperatures fell, Zelensky intensified his calls for a partial cease-fire, under which both sides would agree not to target the other’s energy infrastructure. Trump put his weight behind the proposal last week. “I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” he said on January 29. The Ukrainians, Trump added, almost “didn’t believe it, but they were very happy about it.”

The pause in Russian attacks on Kyiv held over the weekend, while other parts of Ukraine suffered more acts of barbarism. On Sunday afternoon, Russian drones attacked a civilian bus owned by DTEK and carrying miners, killing at least 12 people as they rode home from their shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region, in eastern Ukraine. Still, the weekend saw no Russian missile strikes against Kyiv’s power plants, and Zelensky expressed hope that the respite would lay the groundwork for the next round of talks.

They are due to start tomorrow in Abu Dhabi, and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, will be there to mediate. On Saturday, both men met in Florida with the Kremlin’s envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, to discuss the terms of a possible deal. “We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine,” Witkoff wrote afterward on social media. The Russians, he added, are grateful for Trump’s “critical leadership in seeking a durable and lasting peace.”

But that gratitude did not count for much against Putin’s desire to extend the suffering of Ukrainians. He sees the coldest days of winter as instruments of war, and he will use them no matter what mercies Trump may request. As the sun set over Kyiv today, the air-raid sirens started to wail again across the city center. People got dressed and headed to the shelters, determined to wait out the cold for one more night.</div>

            <h2>The Logical End Point of ‘America First’ Foreign Aid</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/foreign-aid-usaid-strategy-charity/685866/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last summer, the Dalai Lama was having a party in Dharamshala for his 90th birthday, and Bethany Morrison, a newly appointed State Department official, was eager to meet with him there. Inconveniently, the United States had recently canceled about $12 million worth of annual foreign aid benefiting Tibetan-exile communities as part of the implosion of USAID. This, Morrison and other State officials thought, would not make a particularly good impression on His Holiness, according to a former State and a former USAID official.

Prior to the Dalai Lama’s birthday, the two former federal employees told me, they had spent months lobbying for Donald Trump’s administration to restore at least some Asia-based aid projects. They had argued that these projects passed Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s new litmus test for overseas spending: They would make America “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.” Nothing changed. (Like other aid workers I spoke with for this story, the former employees requested anonymity because of fear of professional reprisal.)

But as the party’s date approached, Jeremy Lewin, the new head of U.S. foreign assistance at the State Department, was suddenly persuaded to resurrect aid to Tibetans, and had seemingly little regard for where, exactly, the money would be going, the former employees said. In a June email to other State Department officials, Lewin wrote that he wanted to “give some good news ahead of the trip.” Days before the party, the State Department allocated nearly $7 million to support Tibetan exiles in South Asia. (A State Department spokesperson, who did not give their name, told me in an email that many programs were paused in early 2025 as part of a foreign-assistance review “conducted to ensure that the American taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars were being spent efficiently” but declined to comment on the specific circumstances of Tibetan aid being reinstated ahead of the party.)

For the past half century, the U.S. has pursued, however imperfectly, a straightforward ideal of foreign aid that has been codified in laws passed by Democrats and Republicans alike: Resources should be deployed wherever they are needed most. Under this administration, funding for overseas aid is being evaluated by a different measure—using “dealmaking and transactions as near-exclusive metrics of success,” as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank, put it in November.

Foreign aid has always, to varying degrees, been a political project, meant to accrue soft power by forwarding America’s vision for itself and winning over people abroad. In the past year, though, some aid agreements have been nakedly transactional (the U.S. helping finance malaria drugs in exchange for access to minerals, for instance); others, such as those that preceded the Dalai Lama’s birthday party, simply highlight how haphazardly programs have been picked for survival. The overall result is that, instead of being directed at where they can save the most lives, U.S. humanitarian efforts now seem to be aimed primarily at where they can advance the Trump administration’s other priorities.

When the Trump administration suddenly ended most foreign-assistance programs early last year, governments around the world had little time to adjust budgets or make contingency plans. This gave the U.S. new and pointed leverage over most other countries, which it seems eager to exploit. On July 1, the day that some remnants of USAID were officially absorbed by the State Department, Rubio wrote on Substack that the administration’s foreign-funding thinking “prioritizes our national interests.” Talking points distributed widely within the State Department around that time, obtained by The Atlantic, clarify that under the new “America First” approach, the department plans to award funding to two main types of aid: programs that are strategic and programs that are lifesaving. The talking points emphasize that both categories are “not global charity” but rather “a tool of strategic engagement.”

The State Department spokesperson did not dispute this characterization. “President Trump’s National Security Strategy is very clear: the United States will partner with select countries to reduce conflict and foster mutually beneficial trade and investment relationships, shifting from a traditional aid-focused approach to one that strategically leverages foreign assistance to support economic growth,” they wrote. They added that the U.S. “remains the most generous nation in the world for lifesaving humanitarian assistance.” Notably, the president proposed slashing foreign aid by 70 percent in fiscal year 2026; Congress quietly rejected the cut.

Some of the foreign aid disbursed in the second half of last year appears to have been straightforwardly treated as a bargaining chip. Another senior State official described the department’s approach to me as “Can we cut a tariff deal with this country? Okay, we’ll increase the aid going to them. Are there critical mineral rights that we would like to discuss?” Foreign aid might lubricate that conversation too. The State Department hasn’t been shy about this strategy: In a September memo to Congress, which I obtained after its existence was first reported in The Washington Post, the department says it intended to use foreign-assistance money to incentivize other nations to “support U.S. immigration priorities” and diversify “critical mineral supply chains.”

Weeks later, Equatorial Guinea, a small country on the west coast of Africa, agreed to accept U.S. deportees who are not its citizens; in return, it received $7.5 million from a government fund meant to assist refugees and victims of conflict. Eswatini and Rwanda have signed similar deals. Last month, the State Department made the release of funds to fight malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV in Zambia contingent on its government agreeing to terms “for collaboration in the mining sector” and other economic reforms. The Zambia health-financing agreement is one of more than 50 that the State Department plans to sign with low- and middle-income countries in the next few months. Earlier this month, Mike Reid, the chief science officer for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, acknowledged in a post on his personal Substack that the global-health deals put aside “long-standing, epidemiologically sound priorities” and are “transactional”—but he wrote that he ultimately rooted for their success.

Prior to this administration, the U.S. had generally distinguished a country’s government from its people when making aid decisions. The U.S. led the global effort to reduce the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by the near-total sanctions that had been levied on the country after President Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Kuwait. American taxpayers even fed North Korea during its late-1990s famine. “Showing that the United States stood in solidarity with the world’s most vulnerable people, regardless of what their government did or did not do, was kind of a goal in and of itself, as a projection of American values,” the senior State Department official told me. In some cases, that still appears to hold true: This month, for example, the U.S. announced that it is working with the Catholic Church to deliver food and supplies to Cubans, despite the State Department’s allegations that Cuba’s government sponsors terrorism and concerns about “diversion by the illegitimate regime.”

But neutrality as a rule in aid decisions “no longer exists,” the senior official said. Concerns about diversion and terrorism have been used to justify shutting down all assistance to Afghanistan and Yemen—countries where urgent intervention is needed to prevent deaths from malnutrition, according to the federal government’s famine data. And Rubio justified a muted response to Myanmar’s request for help after a major earthquake last spring in part because “they have a military junta that doesn’t like us.”

Meanwhile, countries that have a history of advancing U.S. security interests have been rewarded: Last month, for instance, as Rubio signed a deal contributing $1.7 billion to Kenya’s health system, he expressed his appreciation for the country leading a United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti, a country the Trump administration hopes to stabilize to prevent would-be migrants from attempting the 600-mile trip to Florida. In April, funding was restored for a desalination plant in Jordan, a country where water scarcity is severe but relatively few people die for want of water—and that happens to be the U.S.’s main Arab ally, and is known to collaborate closely with the CIA. Jordan has benefited from its allyship before: In 2022, a federal watchdog determined that, by sending more funding for clean water and sanitation to Jordan than any other nation, the U.S. was subverting the spirit of the law. But if the old system was slanted by strategic interests, the new one has keeled over in pursuit of them. Jordan now appears to be the one of the only—if not the only—countries where the U.S. has reinstated a water-infrastructure project, despite having abandoned more than 20 half-finished drinking-water and sanitation systems around the world.

Sometimes, the administration’s vision of aid seems to be not “America First,” but “Trump First.” For example, in March, a Vietnamese official announced that work on a suspended USAID project to clean up toxic chemicals would resume, one day after Vietnam’s prime minister reportedly met with a representative of the Trump Organization. Soon after, Vietnamese officials argued that the organization should be allowed to skip meeting several legal requirements to begin constructing a new golf resort in Vietnam on an expedited timeline that would “capitalize on the support of the Donald Trump administration” and be more convenient for Trump’s son Eric, who planned to attend the ground-breaking in May. (The State Department spokesperson said that the chemical project was “a high priority for this Administration” but did not answer followup questions about the relationship between the project and the Trump Organization representative’s meeting with the Vietnamese prime minister. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.)

The Trump administration’s approach to foreign aid may gain more resources for the U.S. in the short term, but it also risks sacrificing other goals. The American intelligence community has long known that insurgent groups—many of which openly seek the destruction of the United States—rely on desperation, food insecurity, and hopelessness to gain recruits. USAID’s collapse has greased their efforts. The State Department spokesperson wrote that the department works with partner governments to “strengthen local security capabilities, improve intelligence-sharing, and disrupt terrorist networks before they can exploit instability.” But after U.S.-funded health and counterterrorism programs in Mozambique were cut last year, ISIS surged into the vacuum. When Trump hastily shut down all foreign aid to Afghanistan, the State Department said its “primary humanitarian objective” in the country was to prevent the resources left behind from going to terrorists. Instead, armored vehicles that American taxpayers had bought for humanitarian workers—along with 147 pieces of sensitive security equipment—were seized by the Taliban. (The State Department spokesperson did not directly address the incident. “The Trump Administration will not allow U.S. taxpayer dollars to be used to enable the Taliban’s heinous behavior,&quot; they told me.)

The United States’ new approach to foreign aid brings the nation in line with authoritarian countries that have historically prioritized strategy over charity. Russia’s grain diplomacy functions with the understanding that food today means military bases tomorrow. China subordinates the goal of improving foreign populations’ health outcomes to establishing dependency on its medical tech. The Trump administration may not have wholly forsaken the extraordinary idea that the United States should spend money to save the lives of ordinary people in foreign countries. But it has trampled on the humanitarian pretense for doing so.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The royal family in Abu Dhabi had a problem. Their AI firm, G42, wanted American chips, but both the Biden administration and Republicans in Congress feared letting them have any out of concern that the chips would be transferred to China.

The family solved the problem last year, The Wall Street Journal has discovered, by using the simplest solution that businesses can now employ for a policy obstacle: They seem to have made a deal with the Trump family. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family sometimes called the “Spy Sheikh,” purchased a 49 percent share in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto firm, thus sending $187 million to Trump-family-controlled entities. That spring, the Trump administration reversed American policy and approved the AI-chip transfer.

A sitting U.S. president shouldn’t have a business partner. If he did, ideally, that partner would be a U.S. citizen and not an agent of a foreign government. But if the president is going to have a foreign operative as his business partner, ideally that partner would not have a nickname like the Spy Sheikh.

President Trump has generally managed to confine the proliferating conflicts between his business dealings and the public interest to second-tier news stories. Trump and his spokespeople have rarely had to even defend his choice to operate a global business empire that stands to profit from his decisions.

David Frum: The Trump presidency’s world-historical heist

The Journal’s explosive report, which constitutes the first established instance of a foreign government official buying a large share of a Trump company after the 2024 election, has at least briefly forced the administration and the Trump family to explain themselves. The defenses put forth are not reassuring.

One defense, via World Liberty itself, is that the company need not follow any different ethical standards than other companies. David Wachsman, a spokesperson for the firm, told the Journal, “The idea that, when raising capital, a privately held American company should be held to some unique standard that no other similar company would be held is both ridiculous and un-American.”

The reason World Liberty might be held to a different standard than other firms is that World Liberty was founded by, among others, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Barron Trump, and “co-founder emeritus” Donald Trump during the home stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign.

A normal business can’t simply change government policy in order to enrich itself. Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust upon taking office to avoid the temptation to tilt the policy agenda in a pro-peanut direction. Other peanut farmers did not have to establish blind trusts in response to Carter’s election. That is the difference between a business owned by a sitting president and one that isn’t.

Wachsman also assured the Journal that Trump and Steve Witkoff, a World Liberty co-founder, “had no involvement in the deal and haven’t been involved in World Liberty since taking office,” as the paper paraphrased his answer. But because Trump’s sons can handle the firm’s business, and presumably have regular opportunities to communicate with their dad, that does essentially nothing to dispel the conflict of interest. All that needs to happen to create a corrupt nexus is for Trump to find out who is giving him money.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, appearing on This Week With George Stephanopoulos, offered two additional defenses that are even less convincing: “President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons. They don’t do so in secret. We don’t learn about it when we find a laptop a few years later. We learn about it when it’s happening.” Blanche elaborated: “The president is ethical. He talks more to the press. He says what’s happening more than any president in history. You have a question about it, you can ask him. He gaggled on the plane last night at midnight for, like, 20 minutes. Okay?”

To say that the president is taking money from interested parties while delivering favorable decisions out in the open is not much of a defense. The cliché “It’s not the crime; it’s the cover-up” presumes that you have enough shame to cover up your crime in the first place. Watergate would have gone differently, but still not well, if Richard Nixon had held a press conference in 1972 to announce that he was hiring a team of burglars to surveil his opponents.

But even that threadbare defense isn’t true. Abu Dhabi’s investment in Trump’s company, the apparent quid in the quid pro quo, was a secret for more than a year until the Journal ferreted it out. Having been caught red-handed, Trump is trying to pretend to have freely disclosed it.

It is true that Trump entertains a lot of questions from the press, to which he often replies by insulting the reporters who asked, lying, or changing the subject. That is transparent in one sense of the word (you can see right through him). But it is not transparent in the sense of voluntarily placing pertinent information in the public domain.

Blanche also insisted that Trump’s World Liberty dealings were not different from the business practices of his predecessor: “I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before, as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn’t do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office.”

This is another defense that is not true and wouldn’t go very far even if it were.

Joe Biden did not run a private business while in office. His son Hunter did get involved in international businesses, such as the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, whose interest in hiring him was almost certainly due to the belief that he could put in a friendly word with his father. That arrangement was sleazy enough. But selling the mere appearance of political clout—as vice president, Joe Biden did not deliver any policy favors for Burisma—was not nearly as unethical as Trump actually delivering for his partner.

The comic aspect of a Trump spokesperson pointing to the Biden administration as precedent is that Trump has repeatedly called his predecessor a crook. He has labeled Biden “Crooked Joe,” accused him of running a “crime family,” and described him as “the most corrupt president in American history—and that’s not even close.”

Now his administration says Trump is merely doing the same thing as the most corrupt president in American history. That would mean that Trump, by his own account, is tied for first place as the most corrupt president in history.

The most revealing—you might even say transparent—defense came from the White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public,” she told the Journal. “There are no conflicts of interest.”

This is a simple but fascinating statement. On one level, it’s just a lie: There are documented conflicts of interest between Trump’s businesses and his policy decisions.

Casey Michel: America has never seen corruption like this

On a deeper level, however, Kelly is asserting that the very idea of a conflict of interest does not apply to this administration. It is a dispute not over facts but over concepts. Trump is challenging the idea that a conflict between the president’s and the public’s interests is possible.

This belief follows more or less from every other decision Trump has made, which has collapsed the space between the president and the state. Trump can apparently give himself and his friends carte blanche to commit crimes, while deeming anybody who opposes him a criminal. He can turn the government into a propaganda arm, naming parts of it for himself and making the Army hold a parade on his birthday.

When his spokespeople claim there are no conflicts of interest, they are defining Trump’s actual theory of governing: L’état, c’est moi.</div>

Make real food expensive, then take away the cheap food.

You can still buy cigarettes, and while there was once an attempt to ban alcoholic beverages, that didn&#39;t last.  So, the most likely outcome is a big ugly warning label on the package that says in so many words &quot;THIS SHIT BE UNHEALTHY, YO&quot;.

Which of course, people will just ignore just as they do the warnings on cigarettes and alcohol.  Because ultimately, if you wanna put garbage in your body, that really should be your choice so long as you&#39;re fully informed.

Many places have limitations on what you can add to a cigarette, specifically flavourings. There are also restrictions on advertising and who can buy them.

The US FDA has proposed limiting nicotine content.

No, real food is cheap. I regularly get real zucchini and real potatoes and onions etc from my garden, practically for free.

The last fucking thing we should be worrying about is ultra processed foods.  Fuck anyone on the left who is worried about this for anyone but themselves.You haven&#39;t thought this through. Given that we as a society going to heavily subsidize food for some people, including children, do you think we should at least insist that these subsidies go toward buying ans consuming healthy foods? Or should we allow these subsidies to get diverted to junk food manufacturers simply because they are the lowest bidder?

And this is why people have issues with the government feeding children; because, invariably, they choose the worst options to feed children.  The cheapest, nastiest, least nutritious slop, but we pay top dollar for it, and every year the food gets worse but the bill gets higher.

I get it&#39;s emotional to complain about starving children, but at some point we need to consider how much we&#39;re spending on poisoning these children.

I can see you are extremely emotional about this issue.

I doubt the opposition to feeding children is based on some &quot;out group&quot; bias, but more in the practicalities. The argument is two fold; quality and cost.  Free food for children will prompt more parents to simply rely on the government to feed their children, resulting in worse health outcomes for the children.  That&#39;s the quality argument, and it&#39;s not a bad one truth be told.

Cost is, of course, as I mentioned; I have yet to meet a government program w

None of that has anything to do with what I posted unless...wait...have I been arguing with a bot?

It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment to look at moral trends, and consider what activities which are currently legal may become illegal in the future.

e.g. If you were playing this game in the past, you might have correctly predicted dog fighting, or legal descrimination based on race.

Looking 100 years into the future, we might wonder about the sport of boxing, or factory farming of animals. But I hadn&#39;t considered ultra-processed food...

Oh, no one wants to play that game, or we&#39;d be having a serious discussion about hormone therapy and medically unnecessary surgeries ( maiming ) for minors.Won&#39;t be 100 years though, more like 10, maybe 20.Imagine what kind monsters people in the future will think we were for allowing that to be done to little ones.  And they&#39;ll be 100% accurate.There is certainly precedent for medical procedures which were introduced, but later banned. The lobotomy is such an example.

During tanking, engineers spent several hours troubleshooting a liquid hydrogen leak in an interface used to route the cryogenic propellant into the rocket&#39;s core stage, putting them behind in the countdown. Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant.  

Teams successfully filled all tanks in both the core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage before a team of five was sent to the launch pad to finish Orion closeout operations. Engineers conducted a first run at terminal countdown operations during the test, counting down to approximately 5 minutes left in the countdown, before the ground launch sequencer automatically stopped the countdown due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.

Part of the reason (not all) that Starship will require so much fuel is because of its size and payload capability, which is FAR greater than any other design has proposed thus far.  That&#39;s not to say that Hydrogen isn&#39;t a more efficient fuel relative to methane.  It is, 2x-3x more energy efficient by weight, but not necessarily by Volume which also matters.

I only say this because the details matter.  It&#39;s not as if swapping Methane for Hydrogen lends itself to an Apples-to-Apples comparison.  It&#39;s more com

If you can use non-hydrogen to complete your mission without refuelling, then you&#39;re fine and dandy.

The Starship&#39;s payload is a problem they are actively working on. The original goal was 200 tons to LEO, but the Starship v2 was only theoretically capable of ~30 tons (v2 will never actually go into orbit anyways). The v2 that has flown to-date did not have a workable payload for the size of the vehicle. The problem is/was dry mass being too high. Supposedly v3 (set to launch next month) can do 100 tons and v4 (which does not yet exist) sets the original target of 200 tons. Whether they have achieved even

Challenger was a problem with a solid fuel booster. No hydrogen involved. Columbia was an issue with ice, which would be a problem for any cryogenic fuel... basically anything other than solid fuel.

For the record, I fully expected the launch to be delayed. just Artemis things.

I&#39;m assuming the OP was referring to the general region, which includes both India and China.

Not quite sure how the proximity of programmers to end-users benefits the corporation.

I think this is a good thing, expand opportunities in other countries, Indian engineers and professionals can earn a good income and not have to drag their family half-way around the world to further their careers.

This should worry the state governments where Google currently has large numbers of workers that will be re-sourced back in to India - for example, CA will lose a lot of jobs I suspect...

Old boss once told me, he&#39;d set up a complete call center for a US client in India, for less than he paid any one of his engineers, maybe 10 years before he and I worked together.

Just move to India already, Google. It&#39;s cheaper, and no burdensome regulations.  You&#39;ll be free to exploit your workers far more than you do here.

I mean, that&#39;s Google&#39;s purpose, right?  Pay as least as possible for everything, including people and talent?

No burdensome regulations?  Try opening a company there.  Of course, for giants like Google, it won&#39;t be remotely problematic, since both the Indian government and various state governments will fall over each other to land them in their states

But other than them, there is a whole host of legacy bureaucratic procedures that people have to go through before their companies can operate.  There is a reason foreign companies typically prefer countries like Singapore or Vietnam to India

Yeah, I mentioned that above - that for Google and other giants, they don&#39;t need to worry.  Indian state governments are more than happy to do what it takes to get them into their states

It&#39;s a different story for no-name companies trying to enter

At least the lie would be gone.  Importing infinite Indians to fill your roles here is of little practical difference to the rest of us than simply moving the company.

I mean, that&#39;s Google&#39;s purpose, right? Pay as least as possible for everything, including people and talent?

That&#39;s literally what all businesses are doing through all departments every day.  The entire goal of businesses is to produce the most value for as little resources as possible.

I don&#39;t know how clueless you have to be to make the statement above, but it shows how pitiful our education system really is.

It&#39;s tough to shake those feudal peasant instincts. Particularly when your employment is designed to imitate it as closely as possible.

Offshoring is even more profitable.  Since now the company can hire people not merely for lower salaries than American citizens, but for salaries commensurate w/ Indians, which is even orders of magnitude lower.  On top of that, they no longer need to sweat over visas, nor deal w/ cultural or linguistic issues

All that said, one reason H1Bs were popular was that there was a time (in the 90s) that American citizens were pretty picky about the companies they worked for, which resulted in many companies not b

Oh yeah, anyone who&#39;s not as stupid as the average MAGA.

Truly astounding that you aren’t getting hired.

You got modded down, but as I noted elsewhere, if a company needs to hire a lot of people from country X, then they might as well open up an office in that country, and enable their employees to continue to live where they are, while working for them.  It is pretty disruptive to both countries to pluck them from country X and relocate them to country Y

Well, this is a solution - the companies in question, instead of applying for more H1B visas, hire the same people in their home country, and w/ it, get the added advantage of a much lower scale of employment related expenses.  If anything, they should welcome these companies hiring these people where they live, rather than bringing them to a country where a lot of them will feel like fish

I know that /.ers are Leftist [...]If that is true, and it may well be, I wonder why.

If that is true, and it may well be, I wonder why.

The president made the argument to Laura Ingraham that he wanted those foreign employees to come to the US and work, since we don&#39;t have citizens w/ the required skills.  But it hardly makes sense to uproot them from their countries and bring them here, which, even w/o the visa work, is more expensive than just opening up offices there.  If needed, they could be brought to the US temporarily for training purposes, but beyond that, they might as well work for these same companies sitting in their home countr

Fully endorse this.  If they want to hire Indians, for whatever reasons, just have offices in India!  Instead of uprooting your employees from their homes in India, where they have families, relatives and others who can support them, just have your offices there.  No need to struggle w/ visas, nor pay them US salaries (which they&#39;d have to if they were to afford the living costs in the US).  Pay them what is standard there, and set up the operations there accordingly

I have seen people, particularly the &quot;free trade&quot; crowd, argue that bringing them here brings jobs to Americans, since these new immigrants/guest workers have to buy products here locally.  Doesn&#39;t quite work, since those here temporarily would tend to convert dollars to rupees, determine that things are too expensive, and avoid shopping all that much.  Also, if we want assimilation w/ US culture, it won&#39;t happen as much, as for most of them, English is a second language.  If people don&#39;t like the &quot;press &#39;2&#39; for Espanol&quot;, imagine when they have to press different numbers for Hindi, Gujarati, Telegu, et al.  We&#39;ll get one more country added to the culture wars, and local resentment against foreigners

Instead, build offices in different Indian cities for employees based in various places, so that they need not relocate.  Even in the above story, Bangalore is already too congested, so Google would be better off building different campuses in other cities as well, such as Pune, Noida, Chennai, Kolkata and so on

H-1B visas used to require salaries of $60K or more - Trump is bumping that up, but I forget the new number - will unemployed Comp Sci/Programmers work for that pay level? What are all those workers holding out for, $100K/yr jobs?

US universities cranked out tens of thousands of mediocre programmers who are going to be squeezed out of industry by AI tools, not imported programmers.

I&#39;m sure that all those Comp Sci/Programmers would love to work for $100K/yr.  But the big question: how many companies can afford it?  Even the Googles and Microsofts of the world know to hire multiple programmers for a fraction of that salary, so as to build in &quot;fault-tolerance&quot;, if you will

Yeah, w/ AI now capable of writing good code, I doubt that programming is any more lucrative for Indians than it is for Americans

That&#39;s the other thing.  If you don&#39;t want to import a population that tends to cluster together and become an attractive target for ICE, it makes more sense to hire those people where they already live, and open offices there.  Since more top officials happen to be Indian to begin w/, they&#39;re already used to the type of country India is

That this shit has been in the works for at least 10 years. It&#39;s got nothing to do with trump. I hate the guy as much as anyone else maybe more however this isn&#39;t even accelerating the move to India. Every large tech company on the planet has been working on this move because of course they have. Nobody&#39;s going to bring somebody here from India with all the costs involved if they can keep them there. You can&#39;t compete with india. You cannot compete with someone who literally makes 1/20th what you do and still somehow has a middle class life.Google has 4 large offices in India already. I&#39;m sure those were also Trumps fault too.  Companies always had the choice of H1-B slave versus cheaper overseas slave.

Overseas labor is not slave labor.  Yeah, if one translates Indian salaries into dollars, then it&#39;ll look like they are earning a pittance.  But if one looks at their cost of living - from housing to food and other daily items, that too is a fraction of what it costs in the US.  People who work there are not slaves at least in terms of what they&#39;re being paid.  In India, there are also far more holidays than there are in the US

Aside from the costs, there is also the small fact that India is, along w/ China, one of the world&#39;s 2 largest markets.  Most of the population now has internet access, courtesy smartphones, and there are a whole host of online services there, and e-commerce has picked up.  So even aside from the cost of doing business, companies have a big incentive for getting into that Indian market, particularly if they can&#39;t fluently play in the China one

This is all about cost of labor.  Not filling gaps in talent pools domestically.  Unless the company is hiring in a different country to support products they are selling to that locality, the us government should tax the us company the avg wage difference for every hire made in a foreign country.  Then we can see what is about filling gaps in talent vs exploiting global flexibility of a company vs individual laborers.

I suspect a large majority of the money spent towards open source is in the form of support contracts, yes, but large contracts paid by large companies to large projects.  The problem is that a majority of the *projects* are small, often single person, and *those* do not have a good way of funding their work.  There is no web of small companies paying small projects keeping the greater open source community healthy, and so smaller projects have to look to other ways to fund work.

fund fund fund... or just volunteer, especially if it&#39;s just something small.

AI is dumb, it cannot innovate.  Without humans creating new training data, it will fall behind.   AI must find a way to avoid being fatal to the host it feeds on.

Does it degrade or stay stagnant.Can do both, either, or also neither.
It&#39;s a complication that has to be accounted for, though.

It can reduce perplexity, but that can very much be a not good thing.

What I can say, is that OSS survived just fine before bullshit like enshittified revenue models become popular, and it will survive the AIpocalypse.
Will OSS change? Yes.

The reason people made open source projects and devoted time to maintaining them, was purely because it was enjoyable to do so. In the age of AI, that is gone. I no longer want to release my work for the benefit of others, because now it is only feeding this infernal bullshit machine, which will steal my work and sell it as its own. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, it will send a deluge of slop bugreports and phishing attacks.AI needs to die. The bubble can&#39;t burst soon enough.

You could always try to do something meaningful and original with your work yourself.

Your post denies the status quo. That isn&#39;t how any of this works at all.

It&#39;s a distillation process. AI absolutely can (and is) being trained on AI-generated, AI-augmented, AI-processed, and AI-sintered data.

I&#39;d suggest you familiarize yourself with where things are today (as opposed to 6 months ago, or 2 years ago). If you haven&#39;t reevaluated state of the art in the past 2 months with any depth, you&#39;re gravely behind.

Does the Akira License involve biker gangs and racing around on a motorcycle?

Stack Overflow activity fell roughly 25% within six months of ChatGPT&#39;s launch.

This has nothing to do with &quot;vibe coding&quot;.

I&#39;m also unclear on what &quot;documentation traffic&quot; and &quot;bug reports&quot; has to do with a project earning money. Is this about seeing advertising? Because I&#39;m not going to contribute to a project if that requires me to look at advertising.

If the project is funded through donations, if the donation link is never seen by human eyeballs; the donation link never gets clicked.

The given example of Tailwind monetized by having the base framework be free, but having a collection of tools including a Component Library be licensed. So if an LLM is pumping out examples rather than the docs, the user isn&#39;t going to see the value add subscription.

If a project has advertising and you see it, then you are already contributing. But if the LLM is has to be &quot;

&quot;Open-source maintainers monetize through documentation visits&quot;

Open source is monetized through documentation visits? Not only most open source programmers know how to use an adblocker, but I also saw very few (thanks god!) documentation pages with ads. What are these people talking about?

That was that website where I couldn&#39;t answer questions in an area regarding which I am an expert, unless I had a certain amount of &quot;reputation&quot;. Rest in peace.

To say that open source is being killed by vibe coding is just... crazy. It&#39;s simply wrong.

There are numerous vibe coding apps now which were written entirely with vibe coding. An entirely new paradigm of development exists today which didn&#39;t exist even a year ago - claude code, opencode (omo/slim), codex, cursor, and on and on. Then you&#39;ve got the agentic stacks, and everything else that&#39;s largely open and free. &quot;Come use this vibe coded thing I built this weekend! It&#39;s live in production, you can see it working - and here&#39;s the git repo!&quot;

Coding skills are no longer a barrier to iteration and improvement. There are so many cool projects out there now being done by people who have an idea and see a business case and want to fill it.

Aside from the projects, I&#39;ve already taken 2 libraries myself and forked them to change (and improve) functionality for my specific use cases. I&#39;m assuming they don&#39;t want my changes, but they can always pull them back if they want. They can see I&#39;ve got a fork. My willingness to deal with &quot;well they may not accept my changes&quot; + slowing my own velocity is low. The repo is public, the commit comments are better than anything I&#39;ve personally done in the past.

&quot;AI and vibe coding breaks that process at the early stages because there is no longer the humans looking at new things and taking a chance on something new and unfinished&quot;

Um... have you even tried vibe coding? You can one-shot a project in 20 minutes. I&#39;ve done it numerous times - an old project I spent weeks writing specifications for, boom, done. I also now have a very useful data indexer which integrates smb shares with MacOS finder. Any sort of idea can now quickly come to fruition in a couple hours with a good set of prompts. Want to make an antiquated database format convertible to a newer platform, and reimplement the frontend? I once had to take a 15-year old physical SCO system running a proprietary database over to a virtual environment, 10 years back. It was a painful process, because SCO and failing hardware. But today? Once I got to that point I could&#39;ve reimplemented it anew in a couple days, allowing those companies to expand the software capabilities they paid hundreds of thousands for at the time, to something which suited their current business needs (which were a paper and spreadsheet process).

A mildly capable office tech could take an existing git repo of their project tree and maintain it/add features and maintain the product well enough using vibe coding, instead of languishing for a decade, like they had to previously.

You seem to be missing the fact that LLMs have vastly exceeded prior functionality. Today, the frontier models are easily 2x what they were in October. October was easily 2x what they were in May of last year. May of last year? 2x as capable as they were the year prior. We&#39;re approaching exponential improvements, and models have been solving previously-unsolved NP hard problems: that&#39;s innovation.

If you have an idea, it can be done with vibe coding today if you have the intelligence and creativity to do it. Simple as. If you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t - and won&#39;t.

People do not understand that coding agents are not LLMs.

They are based on LLMs. But on top of the LLM is an expert system tailored to the task you are using it for.

So the stupid arguments, that LLMs can not reason: are just stupid.

Because it is not the LLM that is reasoning, it is the family of agents on top of it.

Um... have you even tried vibe coding? You can one-shot a project in 20 minutes. I&#39;ve done it numerous times - an old project I spent weeks writing specifications for, boom, done.Have you even spent 5 seconds thinking about what you wrote here? If you need to spend weeks writing a specification and &quot;vibe coding&quot; it takes 20 minutes, it means you are either completely incompetent at writing specifications or your vibe-coded project simple doesn&#39;t do what you wrote in weeks. It&#39;s as simple as that.

I don&#39;t know how the next Python is going to get any traction, if table stakes for adoption is &quot;language is understood by LLMs&quot;.

The current generation of coders won&#39;t use it if their LLM of choice doesn&#39;t understand it.

LLMs won&#39;t understand it if there&#39;s no training data, which comes from users.

I&#39;ve always told people that coding would be automated last, if ever.Apparently I was wrong, and will have to settle for being part of the last generation of coders that can actually read and understand code without

The innovation comes from the guy/girl telling the vibe coding platform what to do.

The Agents produce code you would otherwise write by hand.

What is the farking difference if the next for loop is spit out by an AI, I use Eclipse auto complete, or write it in vi by hand?

None, nothing, nada. It is the exact same sequence of characters.

&quot;One proposed fix is a &quot;Spotify for open source&quot; model where AI platforms redistribute subscription revenue to maintainers based on package usage.&quot;

Proposed fix for what?  And what incentive would motivate &quot;AI platform&quot; developers to involve themselves with &quot;subscription revenue to maintainers&quot;?

Open source, in particular GPL, is communistic, do we assume AI is as well?  Because it sure doesn&#39;t seem like it.  And why does open source funding need to be fixed?  RMS created the GPL to compel others to give sour

It&#39;s more accurate to say that the entire concept of libraries and frameworks is now obsolete. Why bother building and maintaining libraries of tested code when you can just generate it from scratch every time? The only reason we used libraries was to keep things maintainable and reusable. If you can just get an LLM to generate bespoke code on demand, and have it do exactly what you want and nothing else, then every piece of software can be a snowflake... unique and fragile, but infinitely replaceable. It&#39;s a paradigm shift, that&#39;s for sure.

If it comes true. I doubt it will. The reason we maintain libraries is because complexity grows nonlinearly with the size of a system. Keeping the systems small with well-defined interfaces manages that problem.

AI isn&#39;t magic. A computer might have greater capacity for tracking down complex behaviour than a human does but it isn&#39;t infinite. And the current systems, just like humans, do a lot better when they have good libraries to stick together than they do if you ask them for a big bare metal monolith.

1) We have needed a more sustainable financing model for FOSS that matters for quite a while now.

2) &quot;Vibe &quot;coding&quot; will not matter in the long run. Its results are just too abysmally bad. People still need a few years to understand as those of low / no skills are always late in understanding the blatantly obvious. (Dunning & Kruger have an explanation for that ...)

It does not matter if the shiny web site - which works perfectly fine - but is an abomination of spaghetti HTML/CSS/JS was coded by an incompetent web developer.Or was generated by an AI agent based on an LLM fed with abomination code from incompetent web developers.The result is the same.

First case requires you to communicate with a human, and you never know how bad his code is.Second case requires you to &quot;communicate&quot; with an AI agent, and you do not care how bad his code is.

I don&#39;t know of a single company sharing proprietary code. So where will vibe be if there is no code to scan?

On another note. A while back people were worried that open source licensed code would make it in commercial licensed code  and would create some legal issues. Isn&#39;t this also an issue with vibe generated code?

To me it seems that it&#39;s more of an issue that vibe creates a problem for proprietary code. GPL to vide makes vibe code into GPL. Share and share alike.

I love pulling a repo and having Claude explain it and figure out how to run it.It used to take forever to get an unfamiliar repo to work because Linux.This is actually one of the best uses of LLMs, getting someone else&#39;s software to work on my machine.The fear of getting knee deep in the weeds because I don&#39;t understand the repo completely, is now gone.

NOBODY loves Google ads!I don&#39;t entirely understand what background playback has to do with avoiding ads.  If anything, playing in the background without Premium would mean hearing and possibly seeing more ads, because you won&#39;t be able to quickly skip them.I also don&#39;t understand why YouTube thinks paywalling this is a good idea.

It&#39;s all about making you pay for something they aren&#39;t providing.  That&#39;s a scam.

They&#39;re just lying because they really are doing it for the first reason you pointed out. What they should do is recognize that some of their content works fine as an audio experience and start selling audio only ads to play when delivering content in that way. Even if the audio ads don&#39;t make them as much money, the savings from not having to delivery video streams to people who aren&#39;t watching the video should make up for it.This.Also, background does not necessarily mean &quot;screen off&quot;.  It can also mean &quot;floating window&quot;, where you&#39;re still seeing the visual ad content and the video content.  Yeah, users might then swipe it off where they don&#39;t have to see the ad, but either way, they&#39;re hearing it.  And if YouTube can&#39;t figure out how to monetize that, this shows a real lack of imagination.

No, it&#39;s likely about ads. Those browers likely have been able to block the YouTube ads consistently. Firefox has been iffy at best - it usually works, but sometimes YouTube ads breaks through. But Edge and such have been really consistent at being able to skip YouTube ads (usually with UBlock). It&#39;s really the only reason I use Edge these days.

They are ensuring consistency. They are insuring it is consistently shitty.

Is it evil, or merely Grade-A Capitalism?

You create a product in America that is two-tiered, with certain features exclusive to those who pay for Premium features.  Then you find that consumers are able to steal from you by sidestepping said features.  Which of course in turn deters current Premium members from continuing to pay, so they cancel their membership and choose a sidestepping alternative instead.  Which directly impacts your revenue and ability to survive.

If I was alphabet I would be extremely careful to make sure I don&#39;t prefer my own browser.  That is.. unless I wanted the government to break me up.

Yeah, just like what happened to Microsoft when they were found to be a monopoly because they favored their own browser over any other.

We&#39;re so fortunate that they were broken up into multiple companies!

For Microsoft, that would be the wrong way.  Instead of making many Microsofts, the govts should go the other way, and make zero!

A judge already  ruled on that monopoly position and didn&#39;t force them to divest from Chrome. [bbc.com] Why change strategies if there isn&#39;t punishment?

He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world&#39;s most popular browser.

What they are doing is enforcing the same rules to non-Chrome browsers that already applied to Chrome.

i.e. fixing the flaw in their code that let you do background streaming without a premium subscription by using a non-Chrome browser.  They want background streaming to be a &quot;paid subscription only&quot; feature.

You can smell the desperation as they fail to keep people from blocking ads. They&#39;re just so so so so greedy and grasping that they piss themselves into a frenzy if they think they&#39;re losing ad views.

Remember, if you go to the bathroom during a commercial, you&#39;re breaking the implicit contract to watch every ad they show you, or you&#39;ll be STEALING from the advertisers. (Some ad exec actually said something to that effect but I can&#39;t find the quote.)

A Google spokesperson told Android Authority that the platform &quot;updated the experience to ensure consistency,&quot;

TRANSLATION: &quot;Fuck you, you&#39;ll watch our ads or we&#39;ll cripple your browser.&quot;

I find few things on my phone more annoying, than when I close the YouTube app, it keeps playing the video. No, when I close the app, the video needs to go away. Period.

Can&#39;t you just turn off &quot;background app refresh&quot; (or its Android equivalent) for the YouTube app?

I disable that for most apps as a matter of course.

And that&#39;s what really pisses me off.  It&#39;s not a function YouTube had to create and support, it&#39;s a function of the device itself, and they prevent it from working.

I guess your idea of watching a video is different from mine. (And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!) When I watch a video, I&#39;m focused on it, not trying to do something else. When I go do something else, I don&#39;t want the video there interrupting me.

Depends on context. There are some videos I watch because I&#39;m interested, and other videos I watch to go to sleep. With the latter it&#39;s quite nice to be able to turn the screen off and still listen to the audio.

Seems like a waste to use YouTube for audio only. There are plenty of music and podcast apps that focus on sound, and don&#39;t stop playing when your screen is off.

Got that last week suddenly, Brave browser on Android,Checking with ChatGPT, it proposed a few things, the one that worked: load the page in desktop mode.I could then switch off my screen and continue listening.

Then i realised last night that Brave might have done something, or Youtube reversed that function ?I no longer need to load the page in desktop mode, i can switch off my screen, continues to play.

If you wonder why i need this, i listen to stuff while falling asleep.

This is how it has been for YEARS!  They didn&#39;t just do it.  Maybe it&#39;s a new thing on Android, but they&#39;ve had their dicks up iPhone users&#39; asses for years.

I know they dropped that motto long ago.  I still find it both sad and funny.

It’s getting harder and harder to remain with their tools.

I do get value from YouTube to help with home improvement projects and electronics hobby how-tos.

But the level of crap that comes through. How do these guys take themselves seriously?  Ads for get rich schemes, perpetual motion machines (some variant of ‘free energy’ devices), bitcoin, ed drugs, etc.  I don’t have particularly salacious browsing habit

I counter with, I would think the board of any public corporation would have a succession plan ready, say for instance there is a health emergency with the CEO.  Or more likely the CEO does something bad and needs to be removed.   The response to this should be &quot;Enrique Lores has decided to leave HP, the acting CEO is Stacy Smith who is fully capable of fulfilling the role.&quot;

From what I have seen over the years, public boards of directors are utterly useless.  They provide almost zero oversight.  They approve non-sensical CEO pay.  Just awful.

Sidenote.  I worked at a Fortune 50, public firm in a role where I was included in the exec deferred comp plans.   There was a ~100 page plan detail and no kidding, 80 of those pages outlined all the stuff that only applied to C-suite comp.  All the special goodies, health insurance for life, the corporate jet, crazy stock options that could never be under water.  They could not lose money even if the firm went bankrupt.   This part of the system is completely broken.

Who cares what happens to HP, I assumed they had gone bankrupt already?

UBlock does a pretty good job of blocking PayPal&#39;s ads.And if you buy an HP computer (or for that matter, ANY Windows computer), the first step is to wipe the hard drive and install a fresh, clean copy of Windows directly from Microsoft. NONE of the computer manufacturer&#39;s branded software, ads any value whatsoever.

If he&#39;s abruptly stepping down as HP CEO, that really upsets the apple cart. And that&#39;s gotta be tanking HP stock, at least in the short term.

Seriously, common professional courtesy is to at least offer a few weeks transition. For a CEO, a few months is more typical.

The last remaining U.S.–Russia nuclear arms–control treaty, New START, expires on Feb. 5—and, with less than 48 hours to go, President Donald Trump hasn’t done anything about it.

Asked about the impending deadline in his New York Times interview last month, Trump replied, “If it expires, it expires. We’ll do a better agreement,” maybe one that brings in China—which has a growing nuclear arsenal—as a participant.

If past is precedent, a new treaty would take at least a year to negotiate; if China takes part, something that has never happened before, it would take many years.

In the meantime, we may well see the renewal of a nuclear arms race, reversing a trend of the past half-century. The stunning thing is that, by all accounts, Trump and his advisers haven’t so much as held a conversation about the possibility or its implications for U.S. policy or the safety of the world.

It’s worth recalling that when Trump scuttled the Iran nuclear deal back during his first term as president, he said that he—master of the “art of the deal”—would goad Tehran into accepting a “better” deal. This never happened. There is no reason to believe, especially given Washington’s tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing, that he’ll bring about a superior substitute for New START either.

New START—the acronym stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty—was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in February 2011, as a follow-on to previous accords, START and START II, which George H.W. Bush had signed with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, respectively. The Obama–Medvedev treaty went further than the earlier accords, forcing each side to cut its long-range nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads—a 30 percent reduction from START II’s limits, a 75 percent cut from START’s. It also allowed very intrusive on-site inspections of each side’s arsenals to verify that they were in compliance.

New START was set to expire after 10 years. Obama envisioned negotiating, well before then, a follow-on accord that would make still deeper cuts, including short- and medium-range missiles. But it never happened. The U.S. had long ago dismantled almost all of those weapons, for good reason, while Russia retained about 2,000, which it wanted to keep to counter NATO’s superiority in conventional armies (just as, during much of the Cold War, the U.S. and NATO kept thousands of nukes in Western Europe to counter the Soviet Union’s conventional edge). Plus, after Putin returned as Russia’s president and started rattling sabers in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere, the political climate for arms control chilled.

So when Joe Biden came to the White House in January 2021, New START—which he had worked on as Obama’s vice president—was about to expire. The treaty did allow a one-time five-year extension, so he and Putin quickly made it so.* Diplomatic channels were still very much open (Putin wouldn’t launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine for another year); both leaders saw it in their interests to keep a cap on a possible arms race.

Now five years have passed, and here we are. Putin recently proposed a quick accord—it could be drawn up and signed in very short order—to extend New START’s ceilings on nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and warheads for another year. Trump has not replied, at least not in public.

Here’s why this is important: A major purpose of arms control is to put boundaries on the threat—to keep each side from spinning and acting upon “worst-case scenarios” of how many nukes the other side might build and, therefore, how many nukes it needs to build in response.

For instance, in the late 1950s, the intelligence branch of the U.S. Air Force estimated that the Soviet Union would have 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles by 1962, maybe by as soon as 1961. By contrast, the U.S. would have just 65 ICBMs. In other words, there would soon be a “missile gap.” As a result, the Pentagon proposed, and Congress readily approved, our own crash buildup of missiles (which would be built by the U.S. Air Force).

Then, in 1960, photos taken above the USSR, first by U-2 spy planes and then by Discoverer spy satellites, revealed a different story. Independent intelligence analysts at the CIA estimated that the Soviets would have just 50 ICBMs in the next couple of years. In reality, the Soviets turned out to have just four ICBMs. There was a missile gap, but very much in the United States’ favor.

However, by this time, the Pentagon had already embarked on its crash missile buildup. Air Force officers were still arguing they needed 2,000 ICBMs over the long haul. White House aides to President John F. Kennedy argued that the new intelligence data suggested the nation could get by with just 600. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told Kennedy that, as a political compromise, to keep the Joint Chiefs of Staff from rebelling, he needed 1,000. Kennedy, who at the time was inclined to side with his Cabinet secretaries, approved 1,000.

As a result, the Soviets, seeing this American buildup, responded with a very real buildup of their own. Had there been better information, a more bounded threat, the arms race of the missile age might have been squelched before it took off.

The parallels with current times aren’t precise. Intelligence analysts don’t have to rely so much on guesswork. Even without on-site inspection, they can learn or infer a great deal—almost everything—from high-resolution satellites, communications intercepts, and a wide range of technical and human sources. (In 2023, Putin stopped allowing on-site inspections, but the U.S. still has very high confidence that he hasn’t deployed more nuclear weapons than New START allows.)

Still, one can easily imagine even today’s officers and analysts with vested interests or hawkish inclinations arguing that, freed from the restraints of New START, the Russians could build many more missiles and warheads—and, therefore, we need to build many more to match. It’s even easier to imagine Russian officers and analysts, who tend to be more paranoid than ours, doing the same. A stepped-up arms race is likely indeed.

This action-reaction complex stems not just from a psychological need to appear equal (though that is part of what goes on). There’s a tangible element here too. The planners at U.S. Strategic Command—and probably their counterparts in Russia—maintain a “counterforce” strategy. Most of our missiles are aimed at their missiles—and, most likely, vice versa. The warheads on our missiles also have sufficient accuracy and explosive power to destroy or disable the Russian missiles in their blast-hardened silos—and, again, most likely vice versa.

By the logic of this strategy, if the Russians build more missiles, we have to build more missiles too—so that we’re still able to hit all of the targets.

This is where the new dimension of arms-race scenarios comes into focus—China. When Obama and Medvedev signed New START 15 years ago, China barely had enough nuclear weapons to warrant attention. Now they have about 600; within a few years, they’ll approach parity with the U.S. and Russia. Nobody quite knows why; Chinese officers, who used to write a fair amount about nuclear strategy, have gone silent. Whatever the motive, if China is seen as an adversary, and if counterforce is still a centerpiece of U.S. nuclear strategy, then we don’t have enough warheads to cover all of the targets.

This is why some defense analysts say it’s just as well that New START is expiring. They say that the U.S. needs more nuclear weapons than New START permits.

But this is where the discussion should begin, not end. Do we really need to be able to destroy all of the Russian and Chinese missile sites? This is a two-part question: First, what are the chances that we’ll face not just war but all-out nuclear war against Russia and China simultaneously? Second, do we need to have the ability to knock out all of their missile sites in order to deter nuclear war?

Deterring nuclear war is the aim here. If the plan is to fight, maybe win a nuclear war, how does that game go? Would we launch a first strike against Russia and China? If we did, and we aimed to destroy their missile silos, would they launch the missiles on warning, before our warheads struck—in which case, they’d inflict more damage on us than might otherwise be the case? Finally, there’s “nuclear winter“—the theory that a certain number of nuclear explosions (the calculations vary, but some are as low as a few hundred) will ignite so many fires and kick up so much dust that much of life on Earth will end. There is no winner in this war.

These are controversies that have gone on for many decades. In previous administrations, the Pentagon, StratCom, the National Security Council, and sometimes the president himself, have engaged in this discussion. They have published a Nuclear Posture Review, in classified and unclassified forms, that spelled out the policy.

Trump has not done this. It is very unlikely that he or anyone else at a high level has discussed this at all, or is even aware of the dilemmas and imponderables. Nor is there likely to be a discussion of this sort in the next few years. In the meantime, Trump and Putin should sign a one-page document extending the terms of New START. It’s an imperfect accord, but it’s better than crying “Havoc!” and letting slip the dogs of a nuclear arms race.

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

There is a uniquely American kink that holds that what really matters in terms of presidential policies and conduct is the question of whether something is “legal” as opposed to moral. In an essay for the Boston Review headlined “The Moral Stupefaction of the American Public,” professor Joseph Margulies argues that if conduct is deemed permissible simply because a mediocre law student can pen a mediocre legal memo justifying it, the country is in far deeper trouble than it presently comprehends. On this week’s Amicus podcast, he explained to Dahlia Lithwick that the inclination to fetishize that which can be justified legally has a way of opening the door to atrocities that cannot be tolerated. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: In your article, you draw out the fact that lawyers are extremely uneasy about invoking the language of morality, because morality is either too malleable or just sanctimonious and annoying. I think your point is that the law—disaggregated from morality—becomes an endless series of hollow CYA memos to be deployed by any given administration to justify absolutely anything from torture at Gitmo to blowing up fishing vessels in the Caribbean?

Joseph Margulies: Yes. And that which is taking place in Minneapolis—and not simply in Minneapolis, but most pointedly in Minneapolis—ought not be framed as: “Is that lawful?” It ought to be framed as: “Is that right?” Are we going to allow a masked, heavily armed secret police force to march through the city all but unchecked, and checked only by the voluntary surveillance—to the extent they are checked—by plain citizens at their peril? A secret police force that, at least it appears at this point, enjoys absolute impunity?

Those are profoundly moral questions. Those are moral judgements. Have we lost the capacity to say this is simply wrong? That this is a grotesque obscenity and cannot be allowed to continue?

This is no longer simply a question of, “Is it a violation of the 10th Amendment?” That’s what they’re litigating in front of Judge Menendez. Or, “Is ICE violating judicial orders?” Answer: “Yes, there’s 96 of them.” The lawyers are fighting that out. Stop it. This is a horrible, grotesque, and ongoing wrong, and that’s the level at which we need to engage.

Why is it that we substitute what I call our legal voice for our moral voice? This is a country that purports to worship, and I use that term advisedly, the rule of law. We tend to believe that legality establishes rightness, establishes legitimacy. So when a question is posed: “Can they do that?” The answer is usually given in terms of: “Yes, of course, it’s all perfectly legal.” Over time, we lose the capacity to render moral objections, even when what is being done is unspeakably grotesque, because we simply don’t engage these muscles.

I read your piece with my lawyer glasses on, and two objections arose for me. One is that morality, as you and I both know, is not just subjective and inchoate, morality was also used to justify segregation—the anti-miscegenation laws were rooted in “morality.” That means, in a good sense, that morality evolves—that which was considered immoral is now urgently moral. But also, there can’t be any broad agreement about what is moral. What we like about the law, particularly in America, is the story we tell about the Framers creating a church of the law, then creating a religious document that is the Constitution, and then agreeing on certain principles that are legal and not moral. When I read your piece, while I agreed emphatically with it, I found myself getting stuck on the point of: How are we ever going to come to some kind of consensus or scientific agreement about what is moral? How should we think about the fact that what is moral today is egregiously immoral in 10 years’ time?

The myth is that by writing it down in a Constitution, we will achieve some consensus, and the myth is that that consensus will be desirable, that it will be reflective of society’s best impulses. You have an argument, I have an argument, and the debate goes no further. Lawyers seem to disagree, but lawyers in the Justice Department, or lawyers in the Trump administration or the Bush administration before that, say: “We have our document that says this is good,” and that’s just going to have to be enough. Unfortunately, if you engage only in “law-speak,” you’re done. You have nothing to say, unless you want to hold up an opposing memo.

The best example of this is the memos that John Yoo wrote that purported to justify torture. The Supreme Court calls it torture. Let’s just call it that. What we are talking about is strapping a person, with his head lowered on an inclined board, with his face covered, and then pouring water up his nose and down his throat, and holding him there until he breathes water, to bring him within sight of his own death. That is the purpose of waterboarding. You are deliberately bringing him within sight, so that he believes that he is about to die. It’s that moment of sheer terror. That’s what waterboarding is. And doing it over, and over, and over again, 86 times in my client’s case. Well, according to those memos, not only is it not torture, it’s not illegal. “I have a document that says so!”

If they can always write that, and they can always write that, then this pretense, this myth that the law will settle disputes in a fair and neutral way, is just gobbledygook and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise. And those lawyers who, or those law students who think, “I went into the law because it’s certain, it’s definite”—well, get over yourself.

I’m hearing what feels like your peak frustration with the “John Yoo special”: As long as it’s not organ failure, it’s not torture. The critique I’m hearing here is that any lawyer, any 1L with a Westlaw account, could magic up a document to justify anything. But the flip of it, of course, is that we are living in a moment where it’s really essential to know what is legal. And as you’re noting, judges around the country are drawing very firm lines in the sand and saying, “No! That’s unlawful, that’s illegal.” In other words, the thing that you are most worried about is also the thing that is saving us.

We have had district court judges and appellate court judges around the country, out on the hustings, facing death threats, and threats of impeachment, but nonetheless very clearly saying, “No. What you’re doing is unlawful.” So you’re not saying that that is a pointless exercise, that the pushback is futile because none of this has meaning. You’re saying something subtler than that. Right?

When you are trying to bend the will of society to reflect a different reality, trying to achieve a different vision for the world, the law has a role. Going into court, going to Congress, going to your statehouses—law has a role. But what we also know from decades of experience is that the law cannot play its role alone. You must have a popular movement behind it, that speaks in a moral voice, and leverages that moral voice, then lawyers who work with that community can translate that moral voice into a set of legal claims. What matters is the existence of that moral claim, that moral voice. If all you had in Minneapolis were a bunch of lawyers going into court and saying, “This violates the 10th Amendment!” you would not get whatever movement we are going to have. What we are seeing is because there are tens of thousands of people, ordinary citizens, ordinary folks who do not think of themselves as rabble-rousers or activists, who are appalled and who are waking up and are registering this in their moral voice: I will not allow this to happen. This is wrong and I’m gonna brave 20-below weather.

I love what you’re saying, because you are not, in fact, unbraiding the law from morality. You’re actually tethering them more closely together.

I don’t know what the folks who are out there in Minneapolis are thinking exactly. Whether they are defending legal rights or a thing they call the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment. I don’t know whether they can recite the language of the Fourth Amendment. I don’t know whether some of them are making purely moral claims, that “This is an obscenity, and I’m not going to let this happen. You are murdering my neighbors. You are shooting my friends in the back. I’m not going to let you do that.” There may be some combination of both legal and moral claims here, because we are trained to think in legal terms. They may think: “I’m not going to let you do that, and the way I’m going to keep that from happening is to protest, and I’ve got a First Amendment right to protest.” We reflexively, unfortunately, think in these kinds of legal terms, but my point in this piece is that we let the dominance of law-speak gradually silence our moral voice.

You had another chillingly prescient piece in the Boston Review back in September of 2021, which feels like a million years ago. The title of the piece was “9/11 Forever.” The point was that our failure to reckon with the legacy of what happened to the law after 9/11 is absolutely the reason we are living in the slipstream of that today. If we had not been willing to tolerate the things we did to the law after 9/11 in the name of safety, or national security, what we tolerated in terms of torture and cruelty, and surveillance, and the conception of privacy that we gave away, and border security as this existential question about national survival. You wrote about all of those things as the price we were willing to pay to feel safe at the time. And a key element of that architecture was the notion that we were in a “war.” That the war on terror hoovered up the language of war instead of crime, and moved us into a world where as long as you could call it a “war,” everything would be OK. That’s the move?

That’s the move. And now in the Trump administration they have decided to declare war, which is just a rhetorical step, against an endless stream of “others.” None of the real horrors that took place post- 9/11, and those taking place now, could have been possible without a thorough embrace of demonization, without a willingness to cast some people outside the sphere of human regard. “We can do what we want with that person because they are not us. I do not see them in me. I do not see myself in them. ” That’s what demonization is. That’s the first move.

What the Bush administration did so well is to begin with that and then articulate a legal framework to justify it. Law-speak that says, “We don’t need to stop with this demonizing language. That can exist as the context, the background, but given that we all recognize that those who perpetrated this are not us and are monsters, we are allowed to do certain things, and here’s the law that shows it’s OK.”

Nobody is as good at demonizing as Donald Trump. He is the master of it. This is his worldview. “Those who are opposed to me are subhuman. They are not of my species.” Once you embrace the idea that there is a category of people whose existence threatens who I am, and that I can do whatever I want with them, and I call that war, or I call that terrorism—it doesn’t really matter what you call it, but you can always find a lawyer to cloak it in law. That’s the easiest part. The hard part is convincing people that the Mexican immigrant who has been your neighbor for 40 years and who makes your economy run, convincing people that that person is a monster. That’s the hard part, and that’s where his success is. And that’s 9/11 forever. That’s what they’ve achieved. The more you do this, the easier it gets. The more often you repeat this, the easier it becomes.

Not every example of this ends in the same place, but we all know where that dark alley ends. That dark alley ends in all the most vicious pogroms and genocides and holocausts that the world has ever known. They all start with this move. And this is what Trump is doing and he’s really good at it. And he’s got a lot of people who agree.

President Donald Trump on Monday escalated his rhetoric against the American electoral system, telling his former FBI deputy director and serial podcaster Dan Bongino that he wants to “nationalize” American elections in 15 “crooked” states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said. “And it’s amazing the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places.’ ” I too used to think we should nationalize our elections, though not for the insane reasons Donald Trump offers. It is Trump himself who convinced me that I was wrong.

American elections are hyperdecentralized, as they are run on the state, and mostly county, level. States have ultimate responsibility for voter registration rolls, the kind of machinery used to conduct balloting, the rules for contesting elections, laws prescribing how candidates qualify to appear on the ballot, and much more. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that states, through their legislatures, get to set the times, places, and manners of conducting congressional elections, “but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Congress sometimes exercises that power to override state rules. For example, a federal statute requires that members of Congress are elected from single-member districts, not from larger districts where multiple members of Congress could be elected.

Given that authority in what is known as the “elections clause” of the Constitution, Congress could do much more to nationalize elections, for example setting uniform rules for voter registration, the approval of voting machinery, and potentially much more. For a long time I thought Congress should use that power to set up a system of national nonpartisan election administration. Indeed, that was the central argument in my 2012 book, The Voting Wars.

If you look around the world at advanced democracies from Australia to Canada, they have an independent governmental body in charge all national elections. The body imposes uniform standards for registration, ballot access, voting machinery, and much more. One can walk into a polling place in Ottawa or Vancouver and have virtually the same experience.

These nonpartisan election administrators are headed by a civil servant or group that does not answer to the government. They and their workers have allegiance to the integrity of the election system, not to any political actor. In contrast, in the United States partisan actors play important roles in our election process, such as secretaries of state who run for office as Democrats or Republicans.

In The Voting Wars, I argued that by joining other advanced democracies we could decrease the amount of partisan fighting and litigation over election rules, increase the competence of election administration, and assure we have a system run with integrity and fair access to voting.

Donald Trump has caused me to abandon this argument. As I wrote in the New York Times last summer, when the president tried to impose his authority over various aspects of American elections via an executive order: “What I had not factored into my thinking was that centralizing power over elections within the federal government could be dangerous in the hands of a president not committed to democratic principles.” At this point, American democracy is too weak and fragile to have centralized power over elections in the hands of a federal government that could be coerced or coopted by a president hell-bent, like Trump, on election subversion. Courts have ruled that parts of Trump’s executive order are unconstitutional because the president has no role to play in the administration of elections.

Trump’s comments on nationalizing elections ironically prove the point that we should not nationalize elections. He apparently wants to target the administration at blue states, doing who-knows-what to make it harder for people to vote for Democrats. He desperately fears a Congress controlled by Democrats that could check his and his administration’s power. As he did in 2020, when he unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the results of the fair presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden, Trump hangs it all on voter fraud. His comments to Bongino about noncitizens voting, just like his comments about mail-in balloting, show Trump as either a liar or delusional. The amount of election fraud of this type is extremely rare. We know it because states, including red ones like Georgia—where Trump’s administration recently raided election offices in a serious threat to the 2026 vote—have gone hunting for fraud and found very little.

The Supreme Court provides another reason for not nationalizing our elections. The court could soon fully embrace that “unitary executive” theory that there can be no exercise of executive power by the federal government that ultimately does not report to the president. (It’s an argument with an exception likely to be applied to the United States Federal Reserve, in order to protect the value of the justices’ 401(k)s.) The unitary executive theory, if adopted, would mean that presidential control over an election body might be constitutionally required. The Trump experience shows why that would be far too risky.

We should now look to states to step up the competence, integrity, and accessibility of their election systems. They serve as the front line against election subversion. Diffusion of power in the states makes it much harder for Trump to mess with the midterm elections. Whether or not the Framers intended it, our messy, decentralized, partly partisan, uneven system of administering elections turns out to be the best bulwark against would-be authoritarian presidents.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/sudo_maintainer_asks_for_help/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s hard to imagine something as fundamental to computing as the sudo command becoming abandonware, yet here we are: its solitary maintainer is asking for help to keep the project alive.

It&#39;s a common trope in the open-source computing community that a small number of solitary maintainers do a disproportionate amount of work keeping critical software going, often with little recognition or support. Ubuntu Unity and the NGINX Ingress Controller are just two examples we&#39;ve covered in recent months, and now we can add another, far more critical one to the mix.

Sudo, for those not familiar with Unix systems, is a command-line utility that allows authorized users to run specific commands as another user, typically the superuser, under tightly controlled policy rules. It is a foundational component of Unix and Linux systems: without tools like sudo, administrators would be forced to rely more heavily on direct root logins or broader privilege escalation mechanisms, increasing both operational risk and attack surface.

&quot;For the past 30+ years I&#39;ve been the maintainer of sudo,&quot; developer Todd C. Miller notes on his personal webpage. &quot;I&#39;m currently in search of a sponsor to fund continued sudo maintenance and development. If you or your organization is interested in sponsoring sudo, please let me know.&quot;

Miller has been maintaining sudo since 1993. According to sudo&#39;s website, Miller&#39;s former employer, Quest Software, served as sudo&#39;s sponsor beginning in 2010, but its sponsorship of sudo ended in February 2024, which coincides with Miller&#39;s departure from Quest subsidiary One Identity.

Archived copies of Miller&#39;s website suggest he&#39;s been looking for a sudo patron since then.

That said, sudo updates haven&#39;t dried up since then, with plenty of updates released since February 2024 according to sudo&#39;s changelog, so Miller is clearly still working on it - and it definitely still needs updates.

A number of security issues in sudo in recent years have needed patching, like a heap buffer overflow bug identified in 2021 that let any local user gain root-level privileges despite their account not being allowed to run sudo commands. The bug had been present for more than a decade, security researchers noted at the time.

Memory issues have been a common problem for sudo, which has led to the development of sudo-rs, a reinvention of the utility built in Rust, which should make it memory safe and reduce Linux systems&#39; attack surfaces. Ubuntu switched to sudo-rs as the default sudo implementation with the release of Ubuntu 25.10 in October 2025.

Whether sudo will cede more ground to sudo-rs may in part have to do with whether Miller finds a sponsor to fund continued development of the utility. The Sudo Project has a number of individual sponsors on Github, but given the message on Miller&#39;s site remains up two years after he posted it, those individuals likely aren&#39;t footing enough of the bill to let him continue to invest time and energy into the project ad infinitum, just like so many other open source maintainers and developers also in his shoes.

We reached out to Miller with questions on sudo&#39;s future, but didn&#39;t hear back. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GitHub, the Microsoft code-hosting shop that popularized AI-assisted software development, is having some regrets about its Copilot infatuation.

Last week, product manager Camilla Moraes opened a GitHub community discussion to address &quot;a critical issue affecting the open source community: the increasing volume of low-quality contributions that is creating significant operational challenges for maintainers.&quot;

AI slop has come home to roost and GitHub wants help from its community of software developers to figure out how to manage the mess.

&quot;We&#39;ve been hearing from you that you&#39;re dedicating substantial time to reviewing contributions that do not meet project quality standards for a number of reasons – they fail to follow project guidelines, are frequently abandoned shortly after submission, and are often AI-generated,&quot; Moraes wrote.

&quot;As AI continues to reshape software development workflows and the nature of open source collaboration, I want you to know that we are actively investigating this problem and developing both immediate and longer-term strategic solutions.&quot;

Moraes said GitHub is considering various options. These include possibly giving maintainers the option to disable pull requests entirely or to restrict pull requests to project collaborators; the ability to delete pull requests from the interface (to avoid having to look at AI slop); more granular permission settings for creating and reviewing pull requests; triage tools, possibly AI-based; and transparency/attribution mechanisms for signaling when AI tools are used.

GitHub did not immediately respond to a request to quantify the scope of the problem, which can show up in subpar pull requests (PRs) – code changes submitted to a Git repo in the hope they will be reviewed and merged into the codebase – and in shoddy bug reports (which may be accompanied by a pull request to fix the flaw).

But several thread participants acknowledged that dealing with AI-generated code and comments has become a pressing problem.

According to Xavier Portilla Edo, head of cloud infrastructure at Voiceflow and a part of the Genkit core team, only &quot;1 out of 10 PRs created with AI is legitimate and meets the standards required to open that PR.&quot;

Other open source projects have been trying to deal with the tide of AI slop that has swelled over the past two years. Daniel Stenberg, founder and lead developer of curl, and the Python security developer Seth Larson have both been vocal in their objections to the maintenance burden created by low-quality AI-generated bug reports. Despite Stenberg&#39;s acknowledgement that AI bug reports can be helpful if done properly, the curl project recently shut down its bug bounty program to remove the incentive to submit low quality bug reports, whether authored by AI or otherwise.

Jiaxiao (Joe) Zhou, a software engineer on Microsoft&#39;s Azure Container Upstream team and maintainer of Containerd&#39;s Runwasi project and SpinKube, responded to Moraes about how AI code submissions are affecting open source maintainers.

&quot;We held an internal session to talk about Copilot and there is a discussion on the topic where maintainers feel caught between today&#39;s required review rigor (line-by-line understanding for anything shipped) and a future where agentic / AI-generated code makes that model increasingly unsustainable,&quot; he said.

Zhou summarized these concerns as follows:

As noted by Nathan Brake, a machine learning engineer at Mozilla.ai, the open source community needs to figure out how to preserve community incentives to participate when AI is doing the coding work that traditionally earned recognition and the contributor is only writing up the issue description.

&quot;[In my opinion,] much of open-source is really at risk because of this: we need to figure out a way to encourage knowledge sharing to keep alive what makes open source and GitHub so special: the community,&quot; he said, pointing to a recent presentation at FOSDEM by Abby Cabunoc Mayes that addressed the issue.

Chad Wilson, primary maintainer for GoCD, expects that AI agents unleashed as a result of OpenClaw and Moltbook are going to make things worse.

In a post to the thread on Tuesday, he said that he had already dealt with one pull request related to documentation and realized that it was &quot;plausible nonsense&quot; only after spending significant time reviewing it.

With regard to AI disclosure requirements that have been endorsed by others, he said the risk is that the open source social compact will break if there&#39;s no way to easily tell whether one is interacting with a human or an AI bot.

&quot;I&#39;m generally happy to help curious people in issues and guide them towards contributions/solutions in the spirit of social coding,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But when there is no widespread lack of disclosure of LLM use and increasingly automated use – it basically turns people like myself into unknowing AI prompters. That&#39;s insane, and is leading to a huge erosion of social trust.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services&#39; European expansion has hit the buffers as the American cloud provider grapples with aging grid infrastructure and lengthy interconnect delays.

AWS has moved quickly to flood the European continent with its elastic compute fabric, but while it may take two years to bring a new datacenter online, securing power for the facilities can take up to seven years, Pamela MacDougall, who heads energy markets and regulation for AWS EMEA, said in an interview with Reuters this week.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in some European datacenter meccas, like Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin, this wait can extend to as much as a decade.

This isn&#39;t unique to Europe. While a 2025 IEA report showed grid connection lead times ranging from one to three years on average across the US, in datacenter hot spots like Northern Virginia, they&#39;re also pushing [PDF] seven years.

&quot;We&#39;re finding more and more across Europe that certainty of the delivery date has continued to be delayed,&quot; MacDougall told the news wire.

These delays have forced AWS to reassess its European buildout.

Power has become more of a problem for bit barn builders as the AI boom enters its fourth year. Since ChatGPT&#39;s debut in 2022, datacenter power consumption has skyrocketed, with typical rack densities jumping from 6-12 kW to upwards of 140 kW, with 600 kW systems slated to start rolling out next year.

Along with greater power consumption, AI workloads, particularly training, can be extremely spiky, with utilization jumping from just a couple of percent to 100 percent in a fraction of a second. This leaves grid operators and utilities tasked with serving these datacenters little time to respond to surges in energy demand.

The permitting process associated with grid improvements in Europe has also proven problematic, though regulation from the European Commission has been proposed to prevent this process from exceeding two years.

Further complicating matters, energy infrastructure remains in incredibly short supply with turbine manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand.

In response, cloud providers including Amazon have begun turning to alternative energy sources to secure power for their facilities. Amazon last year purchased Talen Energy&#39;s Cumulus datacenter campus next to a nuclear power plant, while Microsoft and Meta are also backing projects to reignite or extend the life of aging reactors.

We&#39;ve also seen a flurry of interest in startups developing small modular reactors (SMRs). These mini nuclear power plants could be deployed alongside datacenters if they can be made commercially viable.

With even the most optimistic SMR roadmaps pushing mass production out to the 2030s, a seven-year lead time on grid connections is probably the better deal for now.

The Register reached out to Amazon for comment on how it plans to address these grid challenges; we&#39;ll let you know if we hear anything back. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Palantir is shaping the &quot;under-the-hood&quot; practices of the US Defense Department as demand for its software grows across warfighting, shipbuilding, and weapons procurement, CEO Alex Karp said during the company&#39;s fourth-quarter earnings call on Monday.

“One of the unusual things that unfortunately we can’t talk about is also just how much we can shape what’s going on under the hood, including how do you orchestrate something in a defense or civilian context?” Karp told investors. “It’s not that we’re the deciders, but it is the first time that we can help shape the footprint against which we execute.”

In December, the company announced it signed an up to $448 million deal with the US Navy to deploy ShipOS, which has demonstrated small-scale successes in streamlining processes used within the Maritime Industrial Base, the network of private companies that build American warships.

In some of those early tests, the company has used its digital twinning technology to reduce the time General Dynamics Electric Boat spent planning a submarine schedule from 160 hours to 10 minutes. It also claims that at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the material review process has shrunk from “weeks” to under one hour.

“From the beginning, we have stuck to our very strong values of expanding what we believe is the noble side of the West, which means being lethal on the front end, meaning outside, against adversaries, if necessary,” Karp said. “Hopefully adversaries do not want to mess with us.”

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar said this has set off a wave of demand across the Department of Defense as the company’s Maven platform provides the Pentagon with the ability to coordinate from “the factory floor to the foxhole” in order to deliver “lethality.”

“We’re starting with the sub fleet, but people are asking us to help with all sorts of different weapon systems: fighters, bombers, surface vessels, drones, weapons themselves, munitions, and it’s a big area for us that spans not only the production of the weapon, but also attainment of them,” Sankar told investors. “And if you think about lethality, the ability to deliver combat power, you need an integrated ability to do this from the factory floor to the foxhole and Maven is a huge investment that has changed how we fight across the joint force on the foxhole side.”

The company made a fortune off US taxpayers last year, as its government business surged 55 percent to $1.86 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, the company grew its government business 66 percent versus the same time last year to $570 million, for an annualized run rate of $2.28 billion.

Next year, the company expects total annual revenue of $7.19 billion, a 60 percent increase over the $4.48 billion it made this year.

Karp said the challenge for Palantir is to keep up with expectations, as over the last year it has supported what he said were the most interesting, intricate, unusual operations that the US government has been involved in, which he can’t talk about.

“We’re not in the business of delivering the best products. We’re in the business of delivering projects that are magical on the front line and we unfortunately can’t talk about some of that, but we’ve seen that in the last year, magical implementations that have actually changed how people view US deterrents,&quot; Karp said during the call. “Obviously, the primary heroes here are the war fighters. But you know, the implementation orchestration, which (Sankar) and many, many people at Palantir have spent tireless nights working on has actually changed what people are able to do.”

Palantir’s government business is also seeing stronger adoption in parts of the Middle East and in China, Karp claimed. Those are geographies where strong-arm leaders with authoritarian regimes have traditionally been in place or have recently surged to power. He said Canada and Europe have been reluctant to buy advanced American defense software, often favoring domestic suppliers.

“So Arab countries and Israel, you see adoption. You see wide scale adoption in China, and you see lack of adoption in Canada, Northern Europe, and in Europe in general,” he said. “One of the countries that has the clearest idea of the problem is France, but they don’t really know how to solve it, because the solution involves buying American products, particularly Palantir.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Baddies are exploiting a critical bug in React Native&#39;s Metro development server to deliver malware to both Windows and Linux machines, and yet the in-the-wild attacks still haven&#39;t received the &quot;broad public acknowledgement&quot; that they should, according to security researchers.

The vulnerability affects the React Native Community command line tool, a very popular npm package with nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads. React Native is a development tool created by Meta that allows users to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-11953, arises because the Metro development server started by the React Native Community command line tool exposes an endpoint vulnerable to OS command injection. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to send a POST request to the server and run malicious executables. Similarly, on Windows machines, miscreants can abuse the security hole to execute arbitrary shell commands with fully controlled arguments.

JFrog researchers discovered the vulnerability and disclosed it in early November after Meta issued a fix. The research team assigned it a critical, 9.8 CVSS severity rating, meaning it&#39;s almost as bad as bugs get.

Bug hunters wasted no time publishing proof-of-concept exploits on GitHub, with one such POC being published the same day as the public bug disclosure.

&quot;VulnCheck observed exploitation attempts as early as December, well before public discussion framed CVE-2025-11953 as anything more than a theoretical risk,&quot; VulnCheck CTO Jacob Baines told The Register. &quot;This demonstrates how quickly attackers can act once scanning becomes viable, and why developer tooling - widespread, inconsistently monitored, and often not treated as production-grade - represents a particularly attractive early target.&quot;

In a Tuesday blog, Baines said the bug isn&#39;t receiving the attention it deserves.

&quot;Now, more than a month after initial exploitation in the wild, that activity has yet to see broad public acknowledgment, and EPSS [the Exploit Prediction Scoring System] continues to assign a low exploitation probability of 0.00405. This gap between observed exploitation and wider recognition matters, particularly for vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit and, as internet-wide search data shows, exposed on the public internet,&quot; he wrote.

Baines said the first wave of exploitation began in December, with more attacks delivering the same payloads observed on January 4 and January 21.

These attacks used a multi-stage PowerShell-based loader delivered through cmd.exe, and the code disabled Microsoft Defender protections before retrieving and running the payload: a Rust-based binary with anti-analysis features, including runtime checks to help avoid detection via static inspection.

&quot;The deliberate disabling of Microsoft Defender protections before payload retrieval indicates the attacker anticipated the presence of endpoint security controls and incorporated evasion measures into the initial execution flow,&quot; Baines wrote in a Tuesday blog.

The attacks originated from the following IP addresses: 65.109.182.231, 223.6.249.141, and 134.209.69.155, with the &quot;windows&quot; payload hosted at 8.218.43.248:60124, and 47.86.33.195:60130 hosting both a &quot;windows&quot; and &quot;linux&quot; binary. ®

            <h2>Next-gen nuclear reactors safe enough to skip full environmental reviews, says Trump admin</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/nextgen_nuclear_reactors_skip_nepa_reviews/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Energy says advanced nuclear reactor designs - many of which have so far existed mainly at the experimental, testing, or demonstration stage - generally pose limited environmental risk and can qualify for a streamlined environmental review for future projects.

The DoE announced the &quot;categorical exclusion&quot; for advanced nuclear reactors (ANRs) in a Federal Register filing on Monday, establishing a pathway that can allow ANR projects to proceed without a full environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), provided specific conditions are met. The move follows Trump&#39;s executive orders directing agencies to streamline environmental reviews for nuclear reactors in order to accelerate their deployment.

A categorical exclusion means that a covered category of actions &quot;normally does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and therefore does not require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement,&quot; the filing says. In this case, that&#39;s referring to ANRs, which include Generation III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and mobile reactors.

Authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning of ANRs are all included in the categorical exclusion.

The DoE justified its decision in a written record of support, arguing that safety features of next-generation reactor designs generally limit their potential environmental impact.

&quot;Advanced nuclear reactors have key attributes such as safety features, fuel type, and fission product inventory that limit adverse consequences from releases of radioactive or hazardous material from construction, operation, and decommissioning,&quot; the DoE said in the record of support, while conceding that most advanced reactor designs have yet to move beyond experiments and demonstrations.

&quot;Although past advanced reactor projects have been for solely experimental, testing, and demonstration purposes … these reactors indicate that reactors in this category developed for additional purposes, such as power production and industrial applications, are also appropriate for this categorical exclusion,&quot; the document explained.

The DoE&#39;s move isn&#39;t entirely surprising given Trump&#39;s executive orders cited in the Federal Register publication specifically ask the DoE to establish categorical exclusions for ANRs. Additionally, the DoE reportedly quietly rewrote other nuclear safety documents to streamline reactor projects recently, eliminating hundreds of pages of requirements, loosening groundwater protections, and increasing radiation exposure limits for personnel, among other changes.

Nonetheless, the DoE&#39;s Office of Nuclear Energy told The Register that, contrary to the definition of a categorical exclusion stated in the Federal Register publication, nuclear reactors would still undergo an environmental review under NEPA.

&quot;The U.S. Department of Energy is establishing the potential option to obtain a streamlined approach for advanced nuclear reactors as part of the environmental review performed under NEPA,&quot; a Nuclear Energy spokesperson told us in an email.

&quot;The analysis on each reactor being considered will be informed by previously completed environmental reviews for similar advanced nuclear technologies,&quot; the spokesperson continued. &quot;This methodology is a win for bipartisan supported NEPA reform and will accelerate licensing of advanced reactors while upholding the highest standards of safety and security.&quot;

The Union of Concerned Scientists&#39; nuclear power safety director, Edwin Lyman, disagrees, telling us the DoE&#39;s move cuts corners that will create a public health and environmental safety risk.

&quot;The test reactor designs currently under construction have primarily existed on paper. This lack of real-world experience with the reactors means that they should be subject to more rigorous safety and environmental reviews before they&#39;re built, not less,&quot; Lyman told us. &quot;Any nuclear reactor, no matter how small, no matter how safe it looks on paper, is potentially subject to severe accidents.&quot;

As Lyman noted, most of the ANR designs that the DoE wants to exempt are still in the development phase. Only a single pair of Generation III+ nuclear reactors has been constructed in the US, and those came online in 2023 and 2024, respectively, at the Vogtle nuclear power facility in Georgia.

Small modular reactors, microreactors, and other fantasy generators are still the stuff of dreams. Just one SMR design has cleared US regulatory approval, and none has yet been built and operated, with at least one project already abandoned. Nonetheless, Energy Secretary Chris Wright claims the US will have at least one SMR up and running before the 4th of July in 2026.

Given how far behind the nuclear industry is in deploying reactor designs that are still the stuff of dreams, it&#39;s going to need as many regulatory rewrites as possible. ®

Google filed its own appeal in the case last month.﻿

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice and the plaintiffs in the antitrust case against Google filed a cross-appeal, as the DOJ Antitrust Division announced in a post on X: “Today, the DOJ Antitrust Division filed notice that it will cross-appeal from the remedies decisions in its case against Google’s unlawful monopolization of internet search and search advertising.”

Just a few weeks ago, Google itself filed a notice to appeal and requested a pause on the remedies ordered by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta last year. Those remedies included requiring Google to share search data with its rivals and barring Google from making exclusive distribution deals for its search or AI products that could hinder distribution for competitors. However, Google was ultimately not required to sell its Chrome browser and wasn’t barred from paying distribution partners for preloading or premium placement of its search or AI products.

The DOJ’s cross-appeal suggests that neither party is fully satisfied with Judge Mehta’s ruling in the case, or at least the remedies ordered in September.

            <div id="article-text">After triggering an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, right-wing provocateur Nick Shirley is reportedly trying the same stunt in San Diego.

After triggering an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, right-wing provocateur Nick Shirley is reportedly trying the same stunt in San Diego.

After right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley’s viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota daycares he said were operated by Somali residents, Donald Trump’s administration responded by flooding the state with federal immigration agents and freezing funding for childcare services. (A judge ruled that the federal government must continue funding childcare subsidies, at least temporarily.) Now Shirley is back loitering outside daycares again, this time in California.

Over the weekend the 23-year-old posted a photo of himself with the caption “Hello California I’ve arrived.” Like with his last video, which featured a “source” later identified by The Intercept as a far-right onetime political candidate and lobbyist, Shirley seems to have had a local tour guide: Amy Reichert, a San Diego right-wing activist who unsuccessfully ran for local election. She said on X that she spent two days with Shirley “checking out learning centers” in the city. An accompanying image appears to show the two of them — a tripod-mounted phone in tow — outside a business.

Shirley’s playbook is essentially to pull public records on licensed childcare facilities, looking for citations or reports from state inspectors that he or his “sources” deem suspicious. He then physically visits daycare facilities and, in the case of the Minneapolis video, demands to “see the children” in the provider’s care. In Minneapolis, a refusal to let Shirley and his team into daycares was taken as evidence that the business was a sham — a claim unsupported by follow-up visits. (Perhaps a good daycare should not allow a random YouTuber near its kids?) Subsequent visits by state inspectors found that children were present at the daycares Shirley visited and that they were “operating as expected.”

Even though Shirley hasn’t yet published a video about San Diego, local childcare providers have already reported harassment. One provider told a local news outlet that she came home with children in her care only to find two men with a camera outside her house who finally left when she entered with the children.

“For over a month, Somali childcare providers have endured harassment by internet vigilantes who are dead set on exposing fraud in California’s highly regulated government child care system,” Doug Moore, executive director of United Domestic Workers of America said in a statement on Tuesday. “In the process, they are stalking and intimidating our members at their homes and places of business. These provocateurs are sowing seeds of hatred and distrust of our neighbors after taking cues from the president who referred to Somalians as ‘garbage.’ We treasure our Somali members and their contributions to our families, our union, and our communities.”

Shirley’s online presence is as much MAGA propaganda as it is algorithm bait — I described him last week as a “slopagandist” similar to yellow journalism of the late 19th century, updated for the influencer age. His content is repetitive, with rehashed video titles and recurring themes and filming locations. Unlike a true ideologue, Shirley will go wherever the audience analytics take him. At the moment, the algorithm is taking him to childcare centers.

﻿The game had already been delayed from a planned October 2025 release date.

Development on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 is on “pause,” according to a statement from a Take-Two spokesperson given to Variety.

“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis said in the statement published by Variety. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have ‘PGA Tour 2K25’ coming out and ‘WWE 2K26’ [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”

The Switch 2’s version of Borderlands 4 was originally announced during Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct last April. It had an October 3rd release date before being delayed just days before the planned launch.

Take-Two, which owns Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox, is making the announcement of the pause alongside its Q3 FY 2026 earnings. On Take-Two’s future games lineup included in an earnings press release, Grand Theft Auto VI is still listed for November 19th, 2026. Launch marketing for the game is set to begin this summer, so perhaps it actually won’t be delayed again. The lineup also includes “TBA” launch dates for Judas, which was officially announced in 2022, and the “next iteration” of the BioShock series, which has had a troubled development.

Additionally, Take-Two says that Grand Theft Auto V, which launched in 2013, has sold more than 225 million units so far.

The Super Bowl is not only one of the biggest sporting events in the world, it’s also one of the best times of year to find a deal on a big TV. For major events in particular, a large TV makes sense because it provides a more immersive experience and allows for groups of friends to gather and enjoy the game together. And as interest in big TVs grows, the prices continue to come down, making them more accessible than ever — especially during sales you’ll find this week.

Which TV is best for you and your space will depend on a few factors: how much light is in your room, how big of a TV can you accommodate, what your viewing habits are (beyond the Super Bowl), and of course what your budget is. But luckily there are plenty of good TVs in different sizes and price ranges to choose from.

There are a few reasons why the S95F is one of the best TVs you can get for game day. It’s more than bright enough to stand up to ambient light that might be streaming in through windows or from lamps and ceiling lights, plus it has a glare-free matte finish that significantly mitigates reflections. So, you’ll be able to keep the lights on to see your food and drink and reflections won’t get in the way of seeing any on-screen action. The S95F is a QD-OLED that has excellent color accuracy and vibrancy that will make the field and the players look realistic, and the OLED technology allows for wide viewing angles, keeping the image consistent for you and your friends no matter who is relegated to the edge seats.

Since it is a flagship TV, the Samsung S95F isn’t the cheapest on this list — the 65-inch model is on sale for $2,297.99 at Amazon — but it’s one of the best TVs on the market. Although, Samsung’s built-in OS Tizen is not the most intuitive, with some useful features buried in the menus. Still, if you have a room that gets a bunch of sun during the day, but want an OLED movie experience at night, the Samsung S95F delivers.

LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features including 4K @ 144Hz.

LG’s C5 is its midrange OLED line, and is one that I’ve been recommending for years. As an OLED with pixel-level brightness control, it boasts excellent black levels and color accuracy. It doesn’t match the S95F in terms of brightness output, and it has a glossy screen finish so reflections might be distracting if you’re in a room with a lot of light, but its picture quality is fantastic. You can also get more screen size for less money when compared to the Samsung, with the 65-inch model currently available for just under $1,400.

The C4, LG’s 2024 C-series model, can also still be found on sale (An Amazon seller has the 65-inch for $1,176.95). While it’s a year older than the C5, there isn’t a drastic difference between the two models. Yes, it’s not quite as bright as the C5, but if you don’t have a problem with ambient light and you want something that offers great picture quality, deep blacks, and accurate colors out of the box, it’s worth the consideration.

TCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang & Olufsen audio system.

The QM7K is TCL’s midrange quantum dot mini-LED TV and is a great way to get a bigger screen into your living room without spending too much. Right now the 75-inch model is available for only $999.99 at Best Buy, and a couple bucks cheaper at Amazon and Walmart. With the 2025 model year, TCL made improvements to its blooming control, so the QM7K handles that better than previous models, as well as preventing light from bright images bleeding distractingly into dark areas of the screen. The QM7K uses an HVA panel that helps with its viewing angles, although it doesn’t match the performance of an OLED.

There are also some great deals for the more budget-friendly model, the QM6K (you can get an extra 10 inches of screen size for the same price as the 75-inch QM7K), but its brightness is not nearly as good as the QM7K, so the image won’t have the same impact. If you really want more screen and aren’t worried about brightness, the QM6K will do the job, but I think it’s worth the extra cost to bump up to the QM7K instead.

For the past few years, Hisense has been offering big deals on big TVs for the Super Bowl, and this year is no different. If you want a truly huge TV, the 100-inch Hisense U75QG is available for just under $2,200 at both Best Buy and Amazon. That’s less than the 65-inch Samsung S95F for an extra 35 inches of diagonal screen real estate. The U75QG is also the brightest TV on this list — hitting nearly 3,000 nits of brightness in small highlights — so there’s no issue with it holding its own against any ambient light. It looks really good out of the box with SDR signals (the vast majority of broadcast TV), so Levi’s Stadium will look realistic. And with a 100-inch screen, the game (and the commercials) will be incredibly engaging.

Once the game is done, the U75QG serves as a great everyday TV with good black levels and gaming support with 4K support at up to 165Hz refresh rate. Its HDR color isn’t as accurate as SDR (it tends a little towards blue as the picture gets brighter), but it will still perform well with movies and regular viewing.

            <div id="article-text">SpaceX is profitable, while xAI is burning about $1 billion a month. Is this another case of Musk bailing out himself?

SpaceX is profitable, while xAI is burning about $1 billion a month. Is this another case of Musk bailing out himself?

On Monday, Elon Musk announced that he was merging two of his companies, SpaceX and xAI, in a deal said to be worth $1.25 trillion. The reason, Musk said in an announcement, was that in order for AI to grow, it needed to go to space.

AI relies on “large terrestrial data centers” that run on “immense amounts of power and cooling,” he said, which comes at great expense to the environment and community opposition. The solution: data centers in space. “In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,” Musk said.

Musk isn’t the only one looking to launch data centers into orbit. Google has Project Suncatcher to build solar-powered AI data centers in space. China is looking into space-based data centers, as is Europe. As we reported last year, space-based data centers — in the form of satellites with solar panels — are Big Tech’s latest fad and Silicon Valley’s newest investable venture.

On the surface, it sounds like a logical solution to the unique problem presented by power-hungry data centers. Local communities are rising up against data center projects over concerns about electricity demand, water usage, and rising utility rates. Launching those data centers into space means they are not taking up any space on Earth, and in a sun-synchronous orbit there is the availability of solar energy.

AI relies on “large terrestrial data centers” that run on “immense amounts of power and cooling,” Musk said, which comes at great expense to the environment

But there’s another, simpler way of looking at Musk’s merger: SpaceX is profitable, and xAI is not. Not only is xAI not profitable, it’s in the midst of a serious cash burn as it races to compete with well-financed rivals like Google and OpenAI. As Bloomberg recently reported, the AI company is burning about $1 billion a month as it spends heavily to build data centers, recruit talent, and run the social media platform X.

Meanwhile, SpaceX generated about $8 billion in profit on an estimated $16 billion of revenue ​last year, Reuters reported. The main revenue driver is Starlink, which accounts for up to 80 percent of the company’s revenue. Since 2019, SpaceX has launched over 9,500 satellites and boasts up to 9 million broadband internet users. The company is also a major government contractor, having secured over $20 billion in NASA and Defense Department deals since 2008. When it goes public later this year, SpaceX is expected to raise up to $50 billion in investment.

Meanwhile, xAI has it own government tie-ups. The Department of Defense is using Grok, in addition to other chatbots, to analyze information that flows through its military intelligence networks.

It’s not clear how investors will feel about merging the cash-burning xAI with the profitable SpaceX. But it’s important to note that Musk has done this before, when he merged the debt-ridden SolarCity with Tesla in 2016. Since Musk was the largest shareholder and chairman of both Tesla and SolarCity, shareholders sued to block the merger, alleging it was a $2.6 billion “bailout” of a cash-strapped, struggling company. Musk eventually won the lawsuit, with a judge ruling that he did not force Tesla to overpay for SolarCity.

Musk now faces a new lawsuit from Tesla shareholders over his creation of xAI. The lawsuit alleges that Musk breached his fiduciary duty to Tesla by forming xAI, which competes with the automaker for AI talent, resources, and Musk’s attention. The news that SpaceX is acquiring xAI certainly won’t settle those concerns; if anything, it makes it more chaotic and complex.

So where does this all leave Tesla? In the most recent earnings report, Tesla said it was investing $2 billion into xAI “to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale.” Grok, xAI’s chatbot that’s currently under investigation in multiple countries for generating nonconsensual sexualized images of people, including children, was recently integrated into certain Tesla vehicles as a voice assistant. Grok also lags behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and other large language models in several key metrics.

Data centers in space is pure Musk futurism that has no guarantee of success. It’s not as simple as just strapping a GPU to a rocket and hitting “launch.” First off, GPUs are total power hogs. Unless you’ve got a nuclear reactor floating up there, you’re going to need a massive solar arrays to power it. Then there’s the communication situation; even if you’re hitching a ride on Starlink, you still have to figure out the budget for sending info back and forth to Earth. Eventually, the numbers start to look pretty scary.

Musk says merging SpaceX and xAI is the way to make it happen. And perhaps one day he’ll take the suggestion of bullish investors to combine all his companies, including Tesla, Neuralink, and the Boring Company, into one massive, Musk-run mega-corporation: Musk Inc., if you will. How will Tesla shareholders react?

“Tesla is Musk’s liquid piggy bank, since it’s publicly traded; his other companies are not,” Tesla investor James McRitchie said during a prevote presentation before the company’s 2024 shareholder meeting, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Either he sticks around long enough to use our shareholder capital to fund his other ventures, or he shifts his attention sooner if we reject his pay package and turn off the money tap.”

The Publisher Content Marketplace could make it easier for AI companies to pay for ‘premium’ content.

Microsoft says it is working on the Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), an AI licensing hub that shows usage terms set by publishers. That way, AI companies can easily shop the terms and set up deals to use online content for “grounding” their AI models, while the content owners get usage-based reporting to help set prices.

Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM with companies including Verge parent Vox Media, The Associated Press, Condé Nast, People, and others. The AI boom has been largely fueled by content ingested without payment, and many of the previously mentioned publishers have filed lawsuits and/or arranged content licensing deals as traffic from traditional sources drops. Some, like The New York Times and The Intercept, have filed copyright lawsuits against both Microsoft and OpenAI.

There’s also a publisher-backed open standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that lays out a framework aimed at keeping the digital media business sustainable in the age of AI. It builds licensing terms into a publisher’s website, dictating how bots should pay to scrape their sites.

When asked about how, or if, that could interact with the PCM, Microsoft spokesperson Courtney Ramirez says the company plans “to work closely with publishing partners as we build this pilot experience,” but doesn’t have “anything specific to share today.”

According to Microsoft, with this setup, “publishers will be paid on delivered value, and AI builders gain scalable access to licensed premium content that improves their products.” The company adds that PCM will “support publishers of all sizes,” including large organizations and independent publications.

“The open web was built on an implicit value exchange where publishers made content accessible, and distribution channels — like search — helped people find it,” Microsoft writes. “That model does not translate cleanly to an AI-first world, where answers are increasingly delivered in a conversation.”

Microsoft says it has started to onboard partners, including Yahoo, as it continues piloting the marketplace and is looking to expand further.

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.
