            <h2>US can’t deport hate speech researcher for protected speech, lawsuit says</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/us-cant-deport-hate-speech-researcher-for-protected-speech-lawsuit-says/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imran Ahmed’s biggest thorn in his side used to be Elon Musk, who made the hate speech researcher one of his earliest legal foes during his Twitter takeover.

Now, it’s the Trump administration, which planned to deport Ahmed, a legal permanent resident, just before Christmas. It would then ban him from returning to the United States, where he lives with his wife and young child, both US citizens.

After suing US officials to block any attempted arrest or deportation, Ahmed was quickly granted a temporary restraining order on Christmas Day. Ahmed had successfully argued that he risked irreparable harm without the order, alleging that Trump officials continue “to abuse the immigration system to punish and punitively detain noncitizens for protected speech and silence viewpoints with which it disagrees” and confirming that his speech had been chilled.

US officials are attempting to sanction Ahmed seemingly due to his work as the founder of a British-American non-governmental organization, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH).

In a shocking announcement last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that five individuals—described as “radical activists” and leaders of “weaponized NGOs&quot;—would face US visa bans since “their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US.

Nobody was named in that release, but Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy, Sarah Rogers, later identified the targets in an X post she currently has pinned to the top of her feed.

Alongside Ahmed, sanctioned individuals included former European commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton; the leader of UK-based Global Disinformation Index (GDI), Clare Melford; and co-leaders of Germany-based HateAid, Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon. A GDI spokesperson told The Guardian that the visa bans are “an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”

While all targets were scrutinized for supporting some of the European Union’s strictest tech regulations, including the Digital Services Act (DSA), Ahmed was further accused of serving as a “key collaborator with the Biden Administration’s effort to weaponize the government against US citizens.” As evidence of Ahmed’s supposed threat to US foreign policy, Rogers cited a CCDH report flagging Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. among the so-called “disinformation dozen” driving the most vaccine hoaxes on social media.

Neither official has really made it clear what exact threat these individuals pose if operating from within the US, as opposed to from anywhere else in the world. Echoing Rubio’s press release, Rogers wrote that the sanctions would reinforce a “red line,” supposedly ending “extraterritorial censorship of Americans” by targeting the “censorship-NGO ecosystem.”

For Ahmed’s group, specifically, she pointed to Musk’s failed lawsuit, which accused CCDH of illegally scraping Twitter—supposedly, it offered evidence of extraterritorial censorship. That lawsuit surfaced “leaked documents” allegedly showing that CCDH planned to “kill Twitter” by sharing research that could be used to justify big fines under the DSA or the UK’s Online Safety Act. Following that logic, seemingly any group monitoring misinformation or sharing research that lawmakers weigh when implementing new policies could be maligned as seeking mechanisms to censor platforms.

Notably, CCDH won its legal fight with Musk after a judge mocked X’s legal argument as “vapid” and dismissed the lawsuit as an obvious attempt to punish CCDH for exercising free speech that Musk didn’t like.

In his complaint last week, Ahmed alleged that US officials were similarly encroaching on his First Amendment rights by unconstitutionally wielding immigration law as “a tool to punish noncitizen speakers who express views disfavored by the current administration.”

Both Rubio and Rogers are named as defendants in the suit, as well as Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Acting Director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons. In a loss, officials would potentially not only be forced to vacate Rubio’s actions implementing visa bans, but also possibly stop furthering a larger alleged Trump administration pattern of “targeting noncitizens for removal based on First Amendment protected speech.”

For Ahmed, securing the temporary restraining order was urgent, as he was apparently the only target currently located in the US when Rubio’s announcement dropped. In a statement provided to Ars, Ahmed’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, suggested that the order was granted “so quickly because it is so obvious that Marco Rubio and the other defendants’ actions were blatantly unconstitutional.”

Ahmed founded CCDH in 2019, hoping to “call attention to the enormous problem of digitally driven disinformation and hate online.” According to the suit, he became particularly concerned about antisemitism online while living in the United Kingdom in 2016, having watched “the far-right party, Britain First,” launching “the dangerous conspiracy theory that the EU was attempting to import Muslims and Black people to ‘destroy’ white citizens.” That year, a Member of Parliament and Ahmed’s colleague, Jo Cox, was “shot and stabbed in a brutal politically motivated murder, committed by a man who screamed ‘Britain First’” during the attack. That tragedy motivated Ahmed to start CCDH.

He moved to the US in 2021 and was granted a green card in 2024, starting his family and continuing to lead CCDH efforts monitoring not just Twitter/X, but also Meta platforms, TikTok, and, more recently, AI chatbots. In addition to supporting the DSA and UK’s Online Safety Act, his group has supported US online safety laws and Section 230 reforms intended to protect kids online.

“Mr. Ahmed studies and engages in civic discourse about the content moderation policies of major social media companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union,” his lawsuit said. “There is no conceivable foreign policy impact from his speech acts whatsoever.”

In his complaint, Ahmed alleged that Rubio has so far provided no evidence that Ahmed poses such a great threat that he must be removed. He argued that “applicable statutes expressly prohibit removal based on a noncitizen’s ‘past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations.’”

According to DHS guidance from 2021 cited in the suit, “A noncitizen’ s exercise of their First Amendment rights … should never be a factor in deciding to take enforcement action.”

To prevent deportation based solely on viewpoints, Rubio was supposed to notify chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations, and House and Senate Judiciary Committees, to explain what “compelling US foreign policy interest” would be compromised if Ahmed or others targeted with visa bans were to enter the US. But there’s no evidence Rubio took those steps, Ahmed alleged.

“The government has no power to punish Mr. Ahmed for his research, protected speech, and advocacy, and Defendants cannot evade those constitutional limitations by simply claiming that Mr. Ahmed’s presence or activities have ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,’” a press release from his legal team said. “There is no credible argument for Mr. Ahmed’s immigration detention, away from his wife and young child.”

To some critics, it looks like the Trump administration is going after CCDH in order to take up the fight that Musk already lost. In his lawsuit against CCDH, Musk’s X echoed US Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) by suggesting that CCDH was a “foreign dark money group” that allowed “foreign interests” to attempt to “influence American democracy.” It seems likely that US officials will put forward similar arguments in their CCDH fight.

Rogers’ X post offers some clues that the State Department will be mining Musk’s failed litigation to support claims of what it calls a “global censorship-industrial complex.” What she detailed suggested that the Trump administration plans to argue that NGOs like CCDH support strict tech laws, then conduct research bent on using said laws to censor platforms. That logic seems to ignore the reality that NGOs cannot control what laws get passed or enforced, Breton suggested in his first TV interview after his visa ban was announced.

Breton, whom Rogers villainized as the “mastermind” behind the DSA, urged EU officials to do more now defend their tough tech regulations—which Le Monde noted passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and very little far-right resistance—and fight the visa bans, Bloomberg reported.

“They cannot force us to change laws that we voted for democratically just to please [US tech companies],” Breton said. “No, we must stand up.”

While EU officials seemingly drag their feet, Ahmed is hoping that a judge will declare that all the visa bans that Rubio announced are unconstitutional. The temporary restraining order indicates there will be a court hearing Monday at which Ahmed will learn precisely “what steps Defendants have taken to impose visa restrictions and initiate removal proceedings against” him and any others. Until then, Ahmed remains in the dark on why Rubio deemed him as having “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” if he stayed in the US.

Ahmed, who argued that X’s lawsuit sought to chill CCDH’s research and alleged that the US attack seeks to do the same, seems confident that he can beat the visa bans.

“America is a great nation built on laws, with checks and balances to ensure power can never attain the unfettered primacy that leads to tyranny,” Ahmed said. “The law, clear-eyed in understanding right and wrong, will stand in the way of those who seek to silence the truth and empower the bold who stand up to power. I believe in this system, and I am proud to call this country my home. I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online. Onward.”</div>

            <h2>Leonardo’s wood charring method predates Japanese practice</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/did-one-line-in-a-leonardo-codex-anticipate-yakisugi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yakisugi is a Japanese architectural technique  for charring the surface of wood. It has become quite popular in bioarchitecture because the carbonized layer protects the wood from water, fire, insects, and fungi, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the wood. Yakisugi techniques were first codified in written form in the 17th and 18th centuries. But it seems Italian Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci wrote about the protective benefits of charring wood surfaces more than 100 years earlier, according to a paper published in Zenodo, an open repository for EU funded research.

As previously reported, Leonardo produced more than 13,000 pages in his notebooks (later gathered into codices), less than a third of which have survived. The notebooks contain all manner of inventions that foreshadow future technologies: flying machines, bicycles, cranes, missiles, machine guns, an “unsinkable” double-hulled ship, dredges for clearing harbors and canals, and floating footwear akin to snowshoes to enable a person to walk on water. Leonardo foresaw the possibility of constructing a telescope in his Codex Atlanticus (1490)—he wrote of “making glasses to see the moon enlarged” a century before the instrument’s invention.

In 2003, Alessandro Vezzosi, director of Italy’s Museo Ideale, came across some recipes for mysterious mixtures while flipping through Leonardo’s notes. Vezzosi experimented with the recipes, resulting in a mixture that would harden into a material eerily akin to Bakelite, a synthetic plastic widely used in the early 1900s. So Leonardo may well have invented the first manmade plastic.

The notebooks also contain Leonardo’s detailed notes on his extensive anatomical studies. Most notably, his drawings and descriptions of the human heart captured how heart valves can control blood flow 150 years before William Harvey worked out the basics of the human circulatory system. (In 2005, a British heart surgeon named Francis Wells pioneered a new procedure to repair damaged hearts based on Leonardo’s heart valve sketches and subsequently wrote the book The Heart of Leonardo.)

In 2023, Caltech researchers made another discovery: lurking in the margins of Leonardo’s Codex Arundel were several small sketches of triangles, their geometry seemingly determined by grains of sand poured out from a jar. The little triangles were his attempt to draw a link between gravity and acceleration—well before Isaac Newton came up with his laws of motion. By modern calculations, Leonardo’s model produced a value for the gravitational constant (G) to around 97 percent accuracy. And Leonardo did all this without a means of accurate timekeeping and without the benefit of calculus. The Caltech team was even able to re-create a modern version of the experiment.

Annalisa Di Maria, a Leonardo expert with the UNESCO Club of Florence, collaborated with molecular biologist and sculptor Andrea da Montefeltro and art historian Lucica Bianchi on this latest study, which concerns the Codex Madrid II. They had noticed one nearly imperceptible phrase in particular on folio 87r concerning wood preservation: “They will be better preserved if stripped of bark and burned on the surface than in any other way,” Leonardo wrote.

“This is not folklore,” the authors noted. “It is a technical intuition that precedes cultural codification.” Leonardo was interested in the structural properties of materials like wood, stone, and metal, as both an artist and an engineer, and would have noticed from firsthand experience that raw wood with its bark intact retained moisture and decayed more quickly. Furthermore, Leonardo’s observation coincides with what the authors describe as a “crucial moment for European material culture,” when “woodworking was receiving renewed attention in artistic workshops and civil engineering studies.”

Leonardo did not confine his woody observations to just that one line. The Codex includes discussions of how different species of wood conferred different useful properties: oak and chestnut for strength, ash and linden for flexibility, and alder and willow for underwater construction. Leonardo also noted that chestnut and beech were ideal as structural reinforcements, while maple and linden worked well for constructing musical instruments given their good acoustic properties. He even noted a natural method for seasoning logs: leaving them “above the roots” for better sap drainage.

The Codex Madrid II dates to 1503-1505, over a century before the earliest known written codifications of yakisugi, although it is probable that the method was used a bit before then. Per Di Maria et al., there is no evidence of any direct contact between Renaissance European culture and Japanese architectural practices, so this seems to be a case of “convergent invention.”

The benefits of this method of wood preservation have since been well documented by science, although the effectiveness is dependent on a variety of factors, including wood species and environmental conditions. The fire’s heat seals the pores of the wood so it absorbs less water—a natural means of waterproofing. The charred surface serves as natural insulation for fire resistance. And stripping the bark removes nutrients that attract insects and fungi, a natural form of biological protection.

Leonardo viewed wood as “not merely a construction material but a living organism—a system in balance with its environment,” Di Maria et al. concluded. “His interest is not limited to mechanical effectiveness but extends to the relationship between matter and environment, between natural processes and human intervention. This perspective positions the Florentine genius as a precursor to what we now call bioarchitectural practice: human intervention on materials must be calibrated to an understanding of their biological and physical properties.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The nervous system does an astonishing job of tracking sensory information, and does so using signals that would drive many computer scientists insane: a noisy stream of activity spikes that may be transmitted to hundreds of additional neurons, where they are integrated with similar spike trains coming from still other neurons.

Now, researchers have used spiking circuitry to build an artificial robotic skin, adopting some of the principles of how signals from our sensory neurons are transmitted and integrated. While the system relies on a few decidedly not-neural features, it has the advantage that we have chips that can run neural networks using spiking signals, which would allow this system to integrate smoothly with some energy-efficient hardware to run AI-based control software.

The nervous system in our skin is remarkably complex. It has specialized sensors for different sensations: heat, cold, pressure, pain, and more. In most areas of the body, these feed into the spinal column, where some preliminary processing takes place, allowing reflex reactions to be triggered without even involving the brain. But signals do make their way along specialized neurons into the brain, allowing further processing and (potentially) conscious awareness.

The researchers behind the recent work, based in China, decided to implement something similar for an artificial skin that could be used to cover a robotic hand. They limited sensing to pressure, but implemented other things the nervous system does, including figuring out the location of input and injuries, and using multiple layers of processing.

All of this started out by making a flexible polymer skin with embedded pressure sensors that were linked up to the rest of the system via conductive polymers. The next layer of the system converted the inputs from the pressure sensors to a series of activity spikes—short pulses of electrical current.

There are four ways that these trains of spikes can convey information: the shape of an individual pulse, through their magnitude, through the length of the spike, and through the frequency of the spikes. Spike frequency is the most commonly used means of conveying information in biological systems, and the researchers use that to convey the pressure experienced by a sensor. The remaining forms of information are used to create something akin to a bar code that helps identify which sensor the reading came from.

In addition to registering the pressure, the researchers had each sensor send a “I’m still here” signal at regular time intervals. Failure to receive this would be an indication that something has gone wrong with a sensor.

The spiking signals allow the next layer of the system to identify any pressure being experienced by the skin, as well as where it originated. This layer can also do basic evaluation of the sensory input: “Pressure-initiated raw pulses from the pulse generator accumulated in the signal cache center until a predefined pain threshold is surpassed, activating a pain signal.” This can allow the equivalent of basic reflex reactions that don’t involve higher-level control systems. For example, the researchers set up a robotic arm covered with their artificial skin, and got it to move the arm whenever it experiences pressure that can cause damage.

The second layer also combines and filters signals from the skin before sending the information on to the arm’s controller, which is the equivalent of the brain in this situation. So, the same system caused a robotic face to change expressions based on how much pressure its arm was sensing.

A lot of the details of how the system operates were figured out empirically. For example, they applied the amount of pressure that registers as pain in human skin, and figured out how frequently their sensors generated spikes. This was then set as a threshold to emit a pain signal to the higher control system, and would trigger any reflex responses to excessive pressure. A lot of the more elaborate responses will ultimately depend on how these higher-level systems are programmed. For example, it’s easy for the system to generate a signal that indicates damage in a specific location in the skin; how the overall system responds to that damage isn’t specified by the skin itself.

But the team did make it easy to repair things if damage occurs. The skin is designed to be assembled from a collection of segments that can snap together using magnetic interlocks. These automatically link up any necessary wiring, and each segment of skin broadcasts a unique identity code. So, if the system identifies damage, it’s relatively easy for an operator to pop out the damaged segment and replace it with fresh hardware, and then update any data that links the new segment’s ID with its location.

The researchers call their development a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, or NRE-skin. “Neuromorphic” as a term is a bit vague, with some people using it to mean a technology that directly follows the principles used by the nervous system. That’s definitely not this skin. Instead, it uses “neuromorphic” far more loosely, with the operation of the nervous system acting as an inspiration for the system.

This is clearest in the case of the positional information. The nervous system actually maintains a map of the body, and links sensory inputs to locations on this map. Biology uses nothing at all like the encoding of positional information in the properties of the activity spikes that the NRE-skin uses. So, this system is more biology-inspired than it is a model of actual biology.

It also falls a bit short of biology in its current implementation, in that all it senses is pressure. Actual skin can process a variety of different sensory inputs, including things like temperatures, irritants, and more. These could all potentially be added to something like NRE-skin, but it would require a parallel processing system to keep the additional signals from getting intermingled with the ones from the pressure-sensitive hardware.

All that said, spiking neuromorphic processors can host neural networks and are far more energy-efficient when doing so. So, even with its limitations, this seems like an area of research worth exploring.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/china-drafts-worlds-strictest-rules-to-end-ai-encouraged-suicide-violence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">China drafted landmark rules to stop AI chatbots from emotionally manipulating users, including what could become the strictest policy worldwide intended to prevent AI-supported suicides, self-harm, and violence.

China’s Cyberspace Administration proposed the rules on Saturday. If finalized, they would apply to any AI products or services publicly available in China that use text, images, audio, video, or “other means” to simulate engaging human conversation. Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, told CNBC that the “planned rules would mark the world’s first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics” at a time when companion bot usage is rising globally.

In 2025, researchers flagged major harms of AI companions, including promotion of self-harm, violence, and terrorism. Beyond that, chatbots shared harmful misinformation, made unwanted sexual advances, encouraged substance abuse, and verbally abused users. Some psychiatrists are increasingly ready to link psychosis to chatbot use, the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend, while the most popular chatbot in the world, ChatGPT, has triggered lawsuits over outputs linked to child suicide and murder-suicide.

China is now moving to eliminate the most extreme threats. Proposed rules would require, for example, that a human intervene as soon as suicide is mentioned. The rules also dictate that all minor and elderly users must provide the contact information for a guardian when they register—the guardian would be notified if suicide or self-harm is discussed.

Generally, chatbots would be prohibited from generating content that encourages suicide, self-harm, or violence, as well as attempts to emotionally manipulate a user, such as by making false promises. Chatbots would also be banned from promoting obscenity, gambling, or instigation of a crime, as well as from slandering or insulting users. Also banned are what are termed “emotional traps,&quot;—chatbots would additionally be prevented from misleading users into making “unreasonable decisions,” a translation of the rules indicates.

Perhaps most troubling to AI developers, China’s rules would also put an end to building chatbots that “induce addiction and dependence as design goals.” In lawsuits, ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been accused of prioritizing profits over users’ mental health by allowing harmful chats to continue. The AI company has acknowledged that its safety guardrails weaken the longer a user remains in the chat—China plans to curb that threat by requiring AI developers to blast users with pop-up reminders when chatbot use exceeds two hours.

AI developers will also likely balk at annual safety tests and audits that China wants to require for any service or products exceeding 1 million registered users or more than 100,000 monthly active users. Those audits would log user complaints, which may multiply if the rules pass, as China also plans to require AI developers to make it easier to report complaints and feedback.

Should any AI company fail to follow the rules, app stores could be ordered to terminate access to their chatbots in China. That could mess with AI firms’ hopes for global dominance, as China’s market is key to promoting companion bots, Business Research Insights reported earlier this month. In 2025, the global companion bot market exceeded $360 billion and by 2035; BRI’s forecast suggests it could near a $1 trillion valuation, with AI-friendly Asian markets potentially driving much of that growth.

Somewhat notably, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman started 2025 by relaxing restrictions that blocked the use of ChatGPT in China, saying, “we’d like to work with China” and should “work as hard as we can” to do so, because “I think that’s really important.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earthquakes, volcanic eruption, eclipses, meteor showers, and many other natural phenomena have always been part of life on Earth. In ancient cultures that predated science, such events were often memorialized in myths and legends. There is a growing body of research that strives to connect those ancient stories with the real natural events that inspired them. Folklorist and historian Adrienne Mayor has put together a fascinating short compendium of such insights with Mythopedia: A Brief Compendium of Natural History Lore, from dry quicksand and rains of frogs to burning lakes, paleoburrows, and Scandinavian “endless winters.”

Mayor’s work has long straddled multiple disciplines, but one of her specialities is best described as geomythology, a term coined in 1968 by Indiana University geologist Dorothy Vitaliano, who was interested in classical legends about Atlantis and other civilizations that were lost due to natural disasters. Her interest resulted in Vitaliano’s 1973 book Legends of the Earth: Their Geologic Origins.

Mayor herself became interested in the field when she came across Greek and Roman descriptions of fossils, and that interest expanded over the years to incorporate other examples of “folk science” in cultures around the world. Her books include The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome’s Deadliest Enemy (2009), as well as Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, & the Scorpion Bombs (2022), exploring the origins of biological and chemical warfare. Her 2018 book, Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology, explored ancient myths and folklore about creating automation, artificial life, and AI, connecting them to the robots and other ingenious mechanical devices actually designed and built during that era.

When her editor at Princeton University Press approached her about writing a book on geomythology, she opted for an encyclopedia format, which fit perfectly into an existing Princeton series of little encyclopedias about nature. “In this case, I wasn’t going to be working with just Greek and Roman antiquity,” Mayor told Ars. “I had collected very rich files on geomyths around the world. There are even a few modern geomyths in there. You can dip into whatever you’re interested in and skip the rest. Or maybe later you’ll read the ones that didn’t seem like they would be of interest to you but they’re absolutely fascinating.”

Mythopedia is also a true family affair, in that illustrator Michelle Angel is Mayor’s sister. “She does figures and maps for a lot of scholarly books, including mine,” said Mayor. “She’s very talented at making whimsical illustrations that are also very scientifically accurate. She really added information not only to the essays but to the illustrations for Mythopedia.

As she said, Mayor even includes a few modern geomyths in her compendium, as well as imagining in her preface what kind of geomyths might be told thousands of years from today about the origins of climate change for example, or the connection between earthquakes and fracking. “How will people try to explain the perplexing evidence that they’ll find on the planet Earth and maybe on other planets?” she said. “How will those stories be told?”

Ars Technica:  Tell us a little about the field of geomythology.

Adrienne Mayor: It’s a relatively new field of study but it took off around 2000. Really, it’s a storytelling that has existed since the first humans started talking to one another and investigating their landscape. I think geomyths are attempts to explain perplexing evidence in nature—on the Earth or in the sky. So geomyth is a bit of a misnomer since it can also cover celestial happenings. But people have been trying to explain bizarre things, or unnatural looking things, or inexplicable things in their landscape and their surroundings since they could first speak.

These kind of stories were probably first told around the first fires that human beings made as soon as they had language. So geomyths are attempts to explain, as I say, but they also contain memories that are preserved in oral traditions. These are cultures that are trying to understand earthshaking events like volcanoes or massive floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, avalanches—things that really change the landscape and have an impact on their culture. Geomyths are often expressed in metaphors and poetic, even supernatural language, and that’s why they’ve been ignored for a long time because people thought they were just storytelling or fiction.

But the ones that are about nature,  about natural disasters, are based on very keen observations and repeated observations of the landscape. They also can contain details that are recognizable to scientists who study earthquakes or volcanoes. The scientists then realized that there had to be, in some cases, eyewitness accounts of these geomyths. Geomythology is actually enhancing our scientific understanding of the history of Earth over time. It can help people who study climate change figure out how far back certain climate changes have been happening. They can shed light on how and when great geological upheavals actually occurred and how humans responded to them.

Ars Technica: How long can an oral tradition about a natural disaster really persist?

Adrienne Mayor: That was one of the provocative questions. Can it really persist over centuries, thousands of years, millennia? For a long time people thought that oral traditions could not persist for that long. But it turns out that with detailed studies of geomyths that can be related to datable events like volcanoes or earthquakes or tsunamis from geophysical evidence, we now know that the myths can last thousands of years.

For instance, the one that is told by the Klamath Indians about the creation of Crater Lake in Oregon that happened about 7,000 years ago—the details in their myth show that there were eyewitness accounts. Archaeologists have found a particular kind of woven sandal that was used by indigenous peoples 9,000 to 5,000 years ago. They found those sandals both above and below the ash from the volcano that exploded. So we have two ways of dating that. In Australia, people who study the geomyths of the Aborigines can relate their stories to events that happened 20,000 years ago.

Ars Technica: You mentioned that your interest in geomythology grew out of Greek and Roman interpretations of certain fossils that they found.

Adrienne Mayor: That really did trigger it, because it occurred to me that oral traditions and legends—rather than myths about gods and heroes—the ones that are about nature seem to have kernels of truth because it could be reaffirmed and confirmed and supported by evidence that people see over generations. I was in Greece and saw some fossils that had been plowed up by farmers on the island of Samos, thigh-bones from a mastodon or a mammoth or a giant rhinoceros. The museum curator said, “Yes, farmers bring us these all the time.” And I thought, why hasn’t it occurred to anyone that they were doing this in antiquity as well?

I read through about 30 different Greek and Roman authors from the time of Homer up through Augustine, and found more than a hundred incidents of finding remarkable bones of strange shape, gigantic bones that were inexplicable. How did they try to explain them? That’s really what got me going. These stories had all been dismissed as travelers’ tales or superstition. But I talked with paleontologists and found that if I superimposed a map of all the Greek and Roman finds of remarkable remains of giants or monsters, it actually matched the paleontological map of deposits of megafauna—not dinosaurs, but megafauna like mastodons and mammoths.

Also, I grew up in South Dakota where there were a lot of fossils, so I had always wondered what Native Americans had thought about dinosaur fossils. It turns out no one had asked them either. So my second book was Fossil Legends of the First Americans. In that case, I knew the geography of all the deposits of dinosaur fossils. I just had to drive about 6,000 miles around to reservations, talking to storytellers and elders and ordinary people to try and excavate the folklore. So I sometimes would read a scientific report in the media and think, “here’s got to be oral traditions about this,” and then I find them. And sometimes I find the myth and seek the historical or scientific kernels embedded in it.

Ars Technica:  What were your criteria for narrowing your list down to just 53 myths?

Adrienne Mayor:  I had to do something for every letter; that was a challenge. A few other authors in the series actually skipped the hard letters. I started out with the hard letters like Q, W, X, Z, Y. My husband says I almost got mugged by the letter Q because I got so obsessed with quicksand. I started talking about writing a book about quicksand because I was so obsessed with sand. There are singing sand dunes.

Ars Technica: There’s been a lot of research on the physics of singing sand dunes.

Adrienne Mayor:  Yes. Isn’t that amazing? There are even some humorous stories. One of my favorites is that Muslim pilgrims in the medieval period would travel to special singing sand dunes between Afghanistan and Iran. When pilgrims would feel the need to relieve themselves, they would try to find some privacy, yet urinating and defecating on the sand dune caused a very loud drum roll sound.

Ars Technica: Your work necessarily spans multiple disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. Has that been a challenge?

Adrienne Mayor: I’ve built my career since my first book in 2000 on trying to write not only to other disciplines, but to ordinary educated readers. Some people think it feels like walking a tight rope, but not to me because I don’t have a canonical academic career. I’m an autodidact, I’m not really an academic. So I have absolutely no problem trespassing in all kinds of disciplines. And I depend on the generosity of all these experts.

Some are from the classics and humanities, but an awful lot of them are from scientific disciplines. I think there’s a big tendency to want to collaborate. It’s just that in academia it’s been difficult because people are siloed. So I feel like I have worked as a bridge between the two. Scientists seem very excited to find out that there are epic poems discussing exactly what they’re studying. Paleontologists were thrilled to discover that people were noticing fossils more than 2000 years ago. So the impulse and the desire to collaborate is there.</div>

            <h2>GPS is vulnerable to jamming—here’s how we might fix it</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/gps-is-vulnerable-to-jamming-heres-how-we-might-fix-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, a Widerøe Airlines flight was trying to land in Vardø, Norway, which sits in the country’s far eastern arm, some 40 miles from the Russian coast. The cloud deck was low, and so was visibility. In such gray situations, pilots use GPS technology to help them land on a runway and not the side of a mountain.

But on this day, GPS systems weren’t working correctly, the airwaves jammed with signals that prevented airplanes from accessing navigation information. The Widerøe flight had taken off during one of Russia’s frequent wargames, in which the country’s military simulates conflict as a preparation exercise. This one involved an imaginary war with a country. It was nicknamed Zapad-2025—translating to “West-2025”—and was happening just across the fjord from Vardø. According to European officials, GPS interference was frequent in the runup to the exercise. Russian forces, they suspected, were using GPS-signal-smashing technology, a tactic used in non-pretend conflict, too. (Russia has denied some allegations of GPS interference in the past.)

Without that guidance from space, and with the cloudy weather, the Widerøe plane had to abort its landing and continue down the coast away from Russia, to Båtsfjord, a fishing village.

The part of Norway in which this interruption occurred is called Finnmark. GPS disruption there is near-constant; problems linked to Russian interference have increased since the invasion of Ukraine.

It’s one of the starkest geographic examples of how vulnerable GPS technology is. But such disturbances happen at a lower level all over the globe. The world’s militaries (including that of the United States) are big culprits, breaking out devices that can confuse or disrupt drones, missiles, and aircraft. But the equipment required to interfere with GPS at a less-than-military level is cheap and accessible and affects other aspects of life: Truck drivers, for instance, use it to look like they’ve delivered cargo on time. Players use it to fool augmented-reality games.

Given all this disruption, more U.S. institutions, from the Department of Defense to the Department of Transportation to the Federal Aviation Administration, are making moves toward alternatives and complements for GPS, though perhaps imperfectly. And the existing system has been undergoing a huge modernization program, introducing better-encrypted signals for military users, more varieties of signals for civilians, and higher-power signals for both to the tune of at least $22 billion. The military’s 2025 budget additionally requested $1.5 billion for more resilient “position, navigation, and timing” programs. Other departments have invested smaller amounts. In October 2025, for instance, the Department of Transportation awarded $5 million total to five companies to develop and demonstrate technologies complementary to GPS.

The update’s goals are to make the system more accurate, and harder to mess with. But as threats increase in frequency and sophistication, more work is necessary. “Sooner or later, we’re gonna see bad things happening here,” said John Langer, a GPS expert at the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit research organization. “So we need to armor up for it before it happens.”

GPS is the invisible spine of society, in more ways than most people realize. It became central quickly after the satellite system, built in the 1970s for the military, was optimized for civilians. “Part of what makes GPS so successful is that it’s ubiquitous and it’s inexpensive,” said Langer.

Losing GPS would mean losing a lot more than Google Maps. The technology is integrated into everything from lights that turn on at sunset to dating apps that match users nearby. Its signals also undergird the electrical grid, cell networks, banking, defense technology, and the movements of robots used in industries like agriculture.

The U.S. government currently has 31 GPS satellites in orbit around Earth, and three other governments have their own systems: Russia made one called GLONASS, China created BeiDou, and the European Union built Galileo; all four systems’ data is available to the international community.

GPS works in a deceptively simple way: Each satellite carries an atomic clock aboard. It broadcasts that clock’s time toward Earth. That signal alone is what’s useful to energy infrastructure and financial transactions. But to get position information, a receiver—in a phone or other device—simply has to pick up signals from at least four satellites. It knows what time those signals were sent, where the satellites were when they sent them, and how long it took the signals to arrive. Through fancy triangulation, the phone (or guided missile) then computes its own location.

Or at least that’s the idea. GPS can be jammed, meaning that someone broadcasts a signal much stronger than that of GPS (which has had to travel across thousands of miles of space, and grows weaker with every meter), drowning the real signal in noise. It can also be spoofed, meaning someone sends out a fake signal that looks just like a GPS blip but indicates an incorrect location or time.

Threats like these were always a possibility—and those who built GPS knew about that problem from the beginning, said Todd Walter, director of the Stanford GPS Lab. “Around 2000 is when people got a little more serious about it,” he said. Hardware and software became cheaper, lowering the barrier to swamping or faking signals.

Problems ticked up when the augmented reality game Pokémon GO came online, in 2016. The game required people to travel to places in real life to win. Turns out, not all of them actually wanted to. “All of a sudden, everyone was interested in spoofing,” said Walter.

Pokémon GO cheaters used low-power devices close to the ground, and so didn’t affect cruising aircraft like Widerøe’s. The game made cheating high-tech and furthered methods and technology for signal scrambling, making it available to non-experts, Walter said. At the same time, spoofing arose in conflict zones, where drone and missile attacks are often guided by GPS. Don’t want to get hit by one? Fool its navigation system. “So now people say, ‘Well, we need to protect ourselves from that,’” said Walter. “And so then you see a huge increase in very powerful jamming and spoofing.”

In Norway, officials have noted that GPS disruptions, while most commonly affecting flights thousands of feet in the air, can also cause issues for police cars, ambulances, and ships. According to Espen Slette, director of the spectrum department at the Norwegian Communications Authority (known as Nkom), the agency has detected GPS jammers near hospitals, which could force life-saving helicopters to redirect to a more distant facility. Nkom has also clocked disruptions that affect agriculture and construction operations, while emergency responders have warned about how problems might home in on emergency beacon devices, like the satellite SOS buttons many people carry in the backcountry or aboard boats. The police’s chief of staff in Finnmark encouraged anyone venturing out to, old-school, carry a map and compass.

“It’s hard to grasp the full effect this has on society,” Slette wrote in an email.

Such widespread disruptions are not isolated to the Russia-adjacent Arctic. There are hotspots in Myanmar, most likely associated with drone warfare in the area; on the Black Sea, publicly associated with Russia, which has denied some cases of GPS interference; and in southern Texas, potentially from drug cartels near the border. A report from OpsGroup, a membership organization for international aviation personnel, found a marked increase in spoofing in 2024. “By January 2024, an average of 300 flights a day were being spoofed,” the report said. “By August 2024, this had grown to around 1500 flights per day.” From July 15 to Aug. 15, 2024, 41,000 flights total experienced spoofing. (While in the U.S., it’s generally illegal for civilians to jam or spoof signals, military-led disruptions during conflict are considered a legitimate and legal use-case.)

The uptick indicates that there’s no going back to a world without disruption hotspots. And that, combined with humans’ dependence on GPS, is why scientists and engineers are working on ways to shore up the system—and develop backchannels so a single-point failure doesn’t come to bite anyone, in conflict or in peacetime.

“There are many ways to mitigate GPS disruptions,” Slette wrote in an email. He suggests setting up devices to use signals from all four international constellations, and to install better receivers and antennas. That’s easier for militaries or infrastructure companies, and hard for people who are just buying the latest model of cell phone and have no control over its innards. But existing backups can tell a given device that something fishy may be up. Planes have inertial navigation systems, which mostly use motion-sensing devices to get an independent measurement; phones do too, and they can also check their data against cell towers, to see if something is off in their GPS signal.

But the U.S. government is worried enough about GPS issues that, across civilian and military agencies, research and development for more robust and resilient systems is ramping up. In March, for instance, the Federal Communications Commission launched a proceeding on GPS alternatives, exploring tools that could be used in addition to or instead of traditional GPS.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and the Defense Innovation Unit, meanwhile, are investigating how quantum sensors might help with position, timing, and navigation. The United States’ military branches are also working on their alternative position, navigation, and timing capabilities, and their innovation arms like the Space Force’s SpaceWerx organization are running challenges to support alternative technologies. The Department of Defense acknowledges challenges to GPS and the consequent need to diversify the ways it gets position, navigation, and timing information, noting that it is pursuing the integration of alternative capabilities, according to a statement that public affairs officer Chelsea Dietlin requested be attributed to a Pentagon spokesperson. It is also looking toward working with commercial companies.

Even the Department of Transportation has a strategic plan that includes promoting technologies complementary to GPS. (Undark reached out multiple times to the Department of Transportation to request comment but did not receive a response.) A statement that FAA media relations specialist Cassandra Nolan requested be attributed to an agency spokesperson noted that the FAA is working on a system to detect GPS interference, and that it is working with the Department of Defense on navigation signals and antennas that are more resilient. In addition, the statement noted, the FAA already has “a layered aircraft tracking system that incorporates multiple technologies to guard against threats to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).”

But the newer efforts across government may not be as connected as they could be, according to Dana Goward, president of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group that largely comprises companies working in the GPS-problem space. For one, he said, efforts to bolster military and civilian systems have a fairly strict line between them. And neither has been as effective as he’d advocate: On the military side, plentiful programs exist, but they may not be working together. “It’s not clear if there is any coordination or synergies between the projects or how much senior leader support there is for comprehensive solution sets,” Goward wrote in an email.

On the civil side, Congress mandated in 2018 that a backup to GPS be established, but only experimental systems exist so far. There also have been efforts to repeal the law, with the disputed rationale that funding a single system isn’t feasible and there are better paths toward resilience. Goward contended that the government has hoped the private sector will come up with a usable solution, saving the government from creating one itself.

And companies are coming to cash in on that desire, offering their solutions to both government agencies and other industries. “Our founding hypothesis was ‘let’s take 50 years of lessons learned but throw out the rulebook and do a clean-sheet design of a new GPS system incorporating a couple of fundamentals,’” said Patrick Shannon, CEO of one such company, called TrustPoint. The company, which has hired scientific and engineering experts in signal processing and space, aims to have a fleet of small satellites orbiting much closer to Earth than the current GPS constellation, and transmitting at a higher frequency.

TrustPoint’s satellites, a few of which have already gone to orbit, also send out an encrypted signal—something harder to spoof. With traditional GPS, only the military gets encrypted signals.

Many Russian jamming systems, he said, work tens of kilometers from their ground zero (their ground zero usually being a truck with a generator aboard). But with TrustPoint’s higher-frequency signals, the effectiveness of the jammer goes down by three times, and the circle of influence becomes 10 times smaller, shrinking even more if the receivers use a special kind of antenna that the U.S. government recently approved.

Messing with signals becomes less feasible, given those changes. “They would need exorbitant numbers of systems, exorbitant numbers of people, and a ton of cash to pull that off,” said Shannon.

So far, TrustPoint has launched three spacecraft, and has gotten five federal contracts in 2024 and 2025, totaling around $8.3 million, with organizations like the Air Force, Space Force, and the Navy.

Another company, called Xona Space Systems, is also putting satellites in low-Earth orbit, and has worked with both the Canadian and U.S. governments. The company plans to broadcast signals 100 times stronger than GPS, giving users two-centimeter precision, and making jamming more difficult. The signal also includes a watermark—a kind of authentication that, at least for now, protects against spoofing. They have launched one satellite that’s being tested by people in industries like agriculture, construction, and mining.

TrustPoint’s technology may offer novel defense against the dark GPS arts, but Xona, whose founders met while students at the Stanford GPS Lab, may have an edge anyway: Its signals are compatible with current infrastructure, so no one has to buy a new device. They just have to update their software. “We are not building receivers ourselves,” said Max Eunice, head of marketing and communications. Instead, they’re relying on the billions of earthly devices that already themselves rely on GPS.

Other solutions, like one called SuperGPS, stay closer to the ground. They use radio transmitters on Earth to do the same things GPS satellites do in space. The setup, as demonstrated by scientists at the Delft University of Technology and VU University in the Netherlands, involves scattering radio transmitters around an area or using those already in place. Each transmitter is synchronized to an atomic clock, which sends the time to transmitters via fiber optic cable, which may already be in a place due to existing communications infrastructure. Receivers can collect signals scattered across a wide range of radio frequencies, making it more difficult to jam or spoof them. The team published a proof of concept in a 2022 Nature paper and is working on a second iteration called SuperGPS2.

Tom Powell, another GPS expert at the Aerospace Corporation, said that looking at alternatives and augmentations like these is important—even though GPS recently underwent the 25-year modernization effort, making its own signals more robust to vulnerabilities. “Now that we have delivered, or nearly completely delivered, this modernization, is there a better way to do it in face of the current realities?” he said. He and other GPS experts don’t have answers yet. “We’re just asking questions right now.”

Walter, the director of the Stanford GPS Lab, thinks that whatever a better path looks like, it will likely still include the old-school, original system. “There’s nothing that really does replace GPS,” he said. “I see articles saying ‘post-GPS World’ and so forth. But really, GPS, I think, will always be there.”

People will, and should, strengthen it, Walter added, but that bolstering is going to be piecemeal—efforts may work in a particular region, or they cover some of GPS’s roles (such as providing accurate time) but not others, or they may back up navigation but not be as accurate. They may also cost money. “GPS is free, so that makes it almost impossible to compete with,” he said.

GPS is also straightforward, said Powell. “As satellites go, they’re pretty simple,” he said. They point at Earth, and they transmit signals that tell what time it is. From that, humans get to live in an interconnected, chronologically propriocepted world. Figuring out how to keep it that way, though, is proving a little more complicated.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This holiday season, German automaker Porsche is winning hearts and minds by putting out a Christmas-themed ad that seemingly isn’t made with AI. What a concept, right?

Called “Porsche Holiday,” the 30-second animated commercial shows a driver elegantly tooling around in his new ride, driving through autumnal scenery on a mountainside road and then a cool sea of glass and concrete as the Sun sets on a city. It’s done up in striking 2D-looking animation with precise lines, pleasing geometry, and eye-popping colors — an ad seemingly done right for a change.

Sharing behind the scenes footage, Porsche revealed in a social media post that the ad was a mix of hand-drawn sketches and CGI. It was made by Parallel Studio, an animation team based in Paris.

Though Porsche made no specific mention of AI, people reading between the lines quickly took that to mean that the automaker was quietly bragging about not using the tech, and hailed it as a victory. This perception of it being AI-free drove it to being remarkably viral, and made it an unexpected hit.

“Can’t wait for more of this anti-AI rebound,” one user wrote.

“Amtrak has been hiring artists to create original animations as well,” observed Nathan Allebach, a creative director. “As slop races us to the bottom, real art signals craft, prestige, and trust.”

The response goes to show how divisive AI is, especially in the arts. And ads, the most commercial art form of all, have both been a useful gauge of how companies have been willing to experiment with the tech and of the public reaction to it, which has been largely pretty negative.

Coca-Cola, for example, unleashed a ghoulishly uncanny iteration of its “Holidays Are Coming” last month that sparked outrage over how overtly ugly it was. McDonalds, too, released an AI-generated ad that proved such a disaster that it sheepishly pulled it entirely.

Everyone knows that our modern idea of the holiday season has been heavily shaped by ad agencies, but no one likes to be reminded of how soulless it can be by seeing AI amalgamations forced onto their eyeballs. At least pretend to care about humans, for Pete’s sake.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some people are hitting a weight loss plateau with GLP-1 agonist drugs like Ozempic, so they’re turning to a stronger variety that promises even more dramatic weight loss — up to more than 70 pounds in some instances, The Atlantic reports.

There’s a small wrinkle: the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to officially approve this medication — technically called retatrutide but cheekily nicknamed a “GLP-3” by users — because it’s still in clinical trials. So the market for it is black, or at least severely grey, with shady overseas companies exploiting a legal loophole to get around regulatory barriers.

In other words, everyone taking retatrutide is basically taking part in an unregulated experiment that could have disastrous results. Sure, you can effortlessly melt off the pounds with the synthetic peptide, but some users have reported disturbing side effects — such as dysesthesia, when your body processes normal sensations but you perceive them as painful, similar to the nerve pain diabetics feel in their feet.

In the grand scheme of things, “GLP-3” users are part of a burgeoning group of people who have turned to foreign-made drugs, many other peptides that are also lacking federal approval. These substances, often manufactured in China, have become wildly popular in recent years for their purported anti-aging and longevity boosting potential, among other miraculous claims.

Companies that sell these drugs are able to skirt federal regulations by writing all over their website that the compounds are not for human consumption and are instead meant for research lab purposes — advice that users are pretty clearly not following.

“All of this stuff just scares the crap out of me,” Randy Seeley, a University of Michigan medical professor and GLP-1 agonist expert, told The Atlantic in reference to the unknown side effects of gray market drugs.

One danger with these drugs, Seeley said, is that their formulations aren’t known and they have the potential to be contaminated with bacteria and other substances. (To allay those concerns, some companies post lab results attesting to the purity of their products.)

Of course, everybody thinks their dealer is an exception.

“There’s a lot of people who just get these things and shoot them,” Marco, a retatrutide user who has bought the drug from what he considers trusted sources, told The Atlantic. “I don’t judge them in any way, but I think those people are out of their minds.”

Injecting GLP-1 agonist drugs into the human body boosts the levels of hormones GLP-1 and GIP, which trigger the release of insulin into your bloodstream. Retatrutide does that and more: it mimics another hormone, glucagon, found in the pancreas. This addition further revs up people’s metabolism, making them lose more weight compared to Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs.

Once clinical trials are done, FDA is expected to approve retatrutide, which will no doubt be a bestseller and make its manufacturer, Eli Lilly, even wealthier.

But even if it’s given the green light, it’s not a guarantee that the demand in the gray market will dissipate, especially if normies find the price too weighty to bear.

            <h2>Alzheimer’s Fully Reversed in Mice, Scientists Say</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A team of American scientists claim they have done something miraculous: they “cured” lab mice suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, which has robbed more than seven million Americans, typically 65 years old and up, of their identity and cognitive ability.

The researchers achieved this feat by administering the rodents with the powerful compound P7C3-A20, which they announced in a new paper in the journal Cell Reports Medicine. Scientists from Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center undertook the study.

“The key takeaway is a message of hope — the effects of Alzheimer’s disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Andrew A. Pieper, the study’s principal investigator and a CWRU neuroscience professor, in a statement about the research. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”

This research is part of a growing wave of very promising lab studies that point to a tantalizing future where Alzheimer’s and other neurological issues could be a thing of the past. Besides this P7C3-A20 research, others have scored remarkable lab results using different compounds and treatments.

This has made normally cautious scientists so excited that they are making bold predictions. University of Edinburgh neuroscience professor Tara Spires-Jones, who wasn’t part of this P7C3-A20 study, told the BBC this month she thinks scientists are closer than ever to a “truly life-changing” treatment — in as little as five to 10 years; instead of a slow death where people lose themselves, she forecasts that new tests will detect the condition early and innovative treatments will “really make your life normal.”

Scientists are also closer to understanding what causes Alzheimer’s, which seems to be sparked by different factors such as genetics, environment and other stressors — which means that future patients may receive personalized cocktail of anti-Alzheimer’s treatment and drugs suited for their own situation.

Regardless of the cause, previous research has suggested that Alzheimer’s is a form of inflammation. That means lessening or zeroing out inflammation in the brain would be key rather than managing symptoms.

In the P7C3-A20 study, the scientists focused on the impact of the crucial molecule NAD+, a coenzyme important for driving cellular metabolism and which decreases as we age, according to the study. Patients with Alzheimer’s suffer from a significant decrease of NAD+ in the brain, and hence their brain cells have trouble maintaining normal functionality, staving off inflammation, and canceling other physical hallmarks of the disease.

For the study, the team first took two types of lab mice that have been genetically bred to be predisposed to Alzheimer’s; one cohort had mutations for the amyloid protein and the other had tau protein mutations. Both proteins are important to cellular function, but they can become dangerous if they accrete in the brain in the form of amyloid plaques and tau tangles — causing a breakdown in normal cellular processes.

The team injected P7C3-A20 into both mice cohorts at two months of age, later finding out that this treatment successfully prevented them from developing the disease. But the big news was when they injected the compound into another batch of lab mice, who were suffering from a relatively advanced stage of Alzheimer’s at six months of age; after getting injections, these mice completely recovered their cognitive ability and NAD+ levels were restored to homeostasis leve;s

“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Pieper in the statement. “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain’s NAD+ balance is restored.”

What’s also good about this study is that P7C3-A20 offers an alternative pathway to boosting NAD+ levels versus taking over-the-counter chemical precursors for NAD+, which can can raise NAD+ to such toxic levels that people could develop cancer, Pieper said. Supplements to boost NAD+ are just a click away on your cellphone, which should be worrying for anybody concerned about cancer.

The team wants to move to human clinical trials but some people are clearly not waiting; if you search online on how to obtain P7C3-A20 for yourself,  numerous websites selling vials of the compound will pop up.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just days after its robotaxi fleet crumbled into complete disarray because of a city power outage in San Francisco, the company was forced to suspend all rides again in the Bay Area on Thursday in anticipation of a nasty storm, CNBC reported.

Customers received word of the measure via the company’s ride-hailing app.

“Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,” a notification read.

While you can hardly fault Waymo for erring on the side of caution, the measure comes as its self-driving cabs’ ability to handle conditions that fall outside its typical programming is being called into question.

The San Francisco incident, for instance, left its robotaxis stranded and helpless on public roads. Footage showed the cabs piling up at intersections, where they appeared confused about what to do without traffic lights to guide them. Rather than taking initiative or moving themselves out of the way, the cabs stayed idling in the middle of the roads, blocking motorists and even other Waymos. One video showed at least five of the cabs stuck in the same intersection. Frightened animals have a fight-or-flight response; Waymos have a stand-dumbfoundedly-in-place response.

Waymo has been offering fully autonomous rides to the public in San Francisco since 2024, with at least 800 robotaxis in the area. And though it boasts an impressive safety record, the cars have been a controversial presence with locals, whose complaints about the vehicles’ safety reached new heights last month when one of the cabs ran over and killed a beloved bodega cat.

Beyond tragedies like those, the cabs have been spotted more than occasionally driving down the wrong side of the road and committing blunders like getting stuck in a roundabout.

Other incidents like careening through an active police standoff and becoming paralyzed by a parade have exposed that the cars still struggle to handle the diversity of offbeat road scenarios one might be expected to encounter in a bustling city like San Francisco. Waymo can’t be blamed for the power outage last week, but that it seemingly didn’t equip its cars to handle a scenario like that is concerning.

“I think we need to be asking ‘what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?&#39;” former CEO of San Francisco’s Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin told CNBC.

            <div id="article-text">Who needs vicious music columnists when you live in the age of AI?

Apparently not Ashley MacIsaac, a Canadian fiddler, singer, and songwriter who was labeled a sex criminal by Google’s AI overview.

According to the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, event organizers at the Sipekne’katik First Nation, north of Halifax, canceled an upcoming performance featuring MacIsaac after Google incorrectly described him as a sex offender.

The paper reports that the misinformation was the result of one of Google’s AI summaries — brief summations it helpfully plasters above all other search results — which blended the musician’s biography with another person who bears the same name.

“Google screwed up, and it put me in a dangerous situation,” MacIsaac told the paper.

Though the AI overview has since been updated, MacIsaac explained that the situation presents a huge dilemma for him as a touring musician. For one thing, there’s no telling how many other event organizers passed on hiring him because of the libelous claim, or how many potential audience members got the wrong impression, but not the correction.

“People should be aware that they should check their online presence to see if someone else’s name comes in,” MacIsaac told the Globe.

After the truth came to light, the Sipekne’katik First Nation issued an apology, and extended a future welcome to the musician.

“We deeply regret the harm this error caused to your reputation, your livelihood, and your sense of personal safety,” a First Nation spokesperson wrote in a letter shared with the newspaper. “It is important to us to state clearly that this situation was the result of mistaken identity caused by an AI error, not a reflection of who you are.”

A representative for Google, meanwhile, said that “search, including AI Overviews is dynamic and frequently changing to show the most helpful information. When issues arise — like if our features misinterpret web content or miss some context — we use those examples to improve our systems, and may take action under our policies.”

Yet as MacIsaac correctly asserts, reputational risk is a difficult thing to repair. There’s no telling how far that misinformation might have spread — and when a corporation rolls out lazy software with obvious flaws, who’s responsible for the damage?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autopilot system took over a plane and pulled off an emergency landing completely autonomously.

The nail-biting intervention took place after the twin engine turboprop, a Beechcraft Super King Air, suddenly lost cabin pressure while flying across Colorado on December 20. Garmin’s Emergency Autoland system then took over, flew the plane, communicated with air traffic controllers, and made a fuss-free landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver.

“This was the first use of Autoland from start-to-finish in an actual emergency,” Garmin said in a statement, via CNN.

Various forms of autoland systems are routinely used to land aircraft in tough weather conditions where visibility is poor — but not during emergencies. Garmin’s system, however, is part of an emerging line of autoland systems intended for emergency use only, and is designed to take “complete control of the flight to land the airplane” in situations “where the pilot is unable to fly,” according to the manufacturer. That it managed to effortlessly handle a real-world emergency here is a milestone in aviation safety.

In this case, Garmin’s Autoland was automatically triggered because the “cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels” after the aircraft experienced “a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization,” Chris Townsley, CEO of the plane’s operator, Buffalo River Aviation, said in a statement. The pilots put on their oxygen masks, then “made the decision to leave the system engaged,” he added.

Once at the reins, the autonomous system selected where to land on its own, based on criteria like distance and runway length, and communicated its intent to ground control. “Emergency autolanding, 19 minutes from runway 30R at KBJC,” the system told the tower, as quoted by The Register.

The plane landed at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport around 2:20 pm local time. No passengers were on board the aircraft. Footage posted by emergency responders shows the two pilots disembark the plane on the runway.

In this case, the pilots made the voluntary decision to let Autoland take over and did not lose consciousness, contrary to initial speculation. (The system’s automated voice erroneously told air control that it had taken over after “pilot incapacitation,” leading to the confusion.)

“While the system performed exactly as expected, the pilots were prepared to resume manual control of the aircraft should the system have malfunctioned in any way,” Townsley said. The pilots “consciously elected to preserve and use all available tools and minimize additional variables in an unpredictable, emergent situation.”

The FAA said it was investigating the incident.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta Platforms is acquiring Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup that’s become the talk of Silicon Valley since it materialized this spring with a demo video so slick it went instantly viral. The clip showed an AI agent that could do things like screen job candidates, plan vacations, and analyze stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research.

By April, just weeks after launch, the early-stage firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million. General partner Chetan Puttagunta joined the board. Per Chinese media outlets, some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via an earlier $10 million round.

Though Bloomberg raised questions when Manus started charging $39 or $199 a month for access to its AI models (the outlet noted the pricing seemed “somewhat aggressive . . . for a membership service still in a testing phase,”) the company recently announced it had since signed up millions of users and crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue.

That’s when Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ, which says Meta is paying $2 billion — the same valuation Manus was seeking for its next funding round.

For Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money (investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree).

Meta says it’ll keep Manus running independently while weaving its agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.

There is one wrinkle, however, which is that Manus, which launched eight months ago, has Chinese founders who founded parent company Butterfly Effect in Beijing in 2022 before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, asking back in May on X who thought it was “a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me.”

Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’s most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.

Unsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.

The more a founder says AI in the pitch, Agarwal said, the less AI the company likely uses. “The people who are doing things that are really innovative, they’ll talk about it, and it’s built in, but it’s not the core of their pitch,” she told the audience.

Bansal, who built and sold multiple companies before becoming an investor, distilled investor expectations into three core questions. First, he asks whether there is a large enough market to tackle. Does the founder’s idea have the potential to become a huge company? And is the problem he or she is solving actually worth solving?

The second thing investors want to know is why this founder is the one who should be building the company. “There has to be something unique about you,” Bansal told the crowd, adding that this included having special members on the founding team or having special skills. “Why would you win? If the problem is interesting, there will be 20 other companies trying to solve it, so why would you win and what’s your opportunity?”

The third thing investors want to see, Bansal said, is some validation. “Traction with customers,” he said. “Validation could be initial customer feedback, revenue, something, but some kind of validation.”

These three questions, Bansal noted, all lead to the ultimate litmus test: Could this become a billion-dollar company?

The panel also addressed how AI startups can differentiate themselves as the space becomes saturated. Bansal emphasized the importance of domain expertise and a clear competitive strategy. Neundorfer said the companies that catch her attention are those enabling new behaviors rather than simply improving an existing process incrementally.

Agarwal offered more tactical advice to founders, saying they should explain how AI technology enables their product; articulate clear go-to-market strategies; and demonstrate how their business will be more efficient than incumbents.

It’s also very important to be honest about what competitors are out there, she added. Some of you have “lost some credibility with me because you didn’t have it on your slide,” she told the founders in the audience.

Finally, the investors shared advice for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape. Agarwal urged founders to stay on top of industry developments. Neundorfer recommended staying connected to founder networks to share tools and insights.

Bansal’s advice was simpler: “Focus on building your product.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/social-media-follower-counts-have-never-mattered-less-creator-economy-execs-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As social media becomes increasingly reliant on algorithmic feeds, creators are navigating a new normal: Just because you post something doesn’t mean your followers will see it.

“I think that 2025 was the year where the algorithm completely took over, so followings stopped mattering entirely,” LTK CEO Amber Venz Box told TechCrunch.

This isn’t news to creators – Patreon CEO Jack Conte has ardently banged this drum for years – but throughout the year, the industry at large has reacted to this phenomenon in different ways, from the influencers to the streamers.

According to the executives that TechCrunch spoke to about the near future of the creator economy, creators are finding new ways to harness and cultivate their relationships with their followers – some acting as a salve to AI slop, while others are flooding the zone with a new form of slop themselves.

Box’s company, LTK, connects creators with brands through affiliate marketing, where creators earn commissions on products they recommend. The business model depends entirely on audiences retaining trust in individual creators. Given concerns about fragmentation in the creator-audience relationship, this could pose an existential threat to the company.

But a study commissioned from Northwestern University found that trust in creators increased 21% year-over-year, which was a pleasant surprise to Box.

“If you asked me at the beginning of 2025, ‘Hey, is trust in creators going to go up or down?’ I would have probably said down, because people understand it’s an industry – they understand how it’s working,” she said. “But actually, AI pushed people to kind of rotate trust to real humans that they know have real life experiences.”

By that, Box means that consumers are more likely to go out of their way to see content from the creators they know and trust. According to the study, 97% of chief marketing officers intend to grow influencer marketing budgets in the new year.

That doesn’t mean that owning these relationships is straightforward. LTK creators, who rely on affiliate income, are betting this AI-induced skepticism will drive people toward more direct relationships through paid fan communities or less algorithmic platforms like LTK itself. For other kinds of creators, such as streamers, video podcasters, and short filmmakers, the strategy for owning their audience can more closely resemble growth hacking.

As Sean Atkins, CEO of short-form video production company Dhar Mann Studios, put it, “In a world that’s driven by AI and algorithms, where people trust another human being more in this micro atomization of attention, how do you market when you sort of can’t control that?”

According to Eric Wei, cofounder of Karat Financial, a financial services company for creators, creators have a new secret weapon: armies of teenagers on Discord who creators pay to make clips of their content, which those same teenagers post en masse on algorithmic platforms.

“That’s been going on for a bit,” Wei explained. “Drake does it. A lot of the biggest creators and streamers in the world have been doing it – Kai Cenat [a top Twitch streamer] has done it – hitting millions of impressions… If it’s algorithmically determined, clipping suddenly makes sense, because it can come from any random account that just has really good clips.”

Wei thinks that clipping is going to become even more popular this year, since it’s a reaction to this fragmentation in social media relationships. Even the biggest creators are finding it hard to reach their fans directly, which is why they turn to clipping. While going viral on these algorithmic feeds is certainly easier if you have a ton of followers, you don’t need any track-record on a platform for it to decide that your video should be distributed more broadly. So, if these “clippers” post a short highlight from certain creators’ streams, they can earn money based on how many views the video gets.

“Clipping feels like an evolution of meme accounts,” Glenn Ginsburg, president of QYOU Media, which produces content for young audiences, told TechCrunch. “It’s become a race among many creators to try and take this content and push it out far and wide, almost competing to see who can get the most views on the same IP.”

Reed Duchscher – founding CEO of Night, the talent management company that represents Kai Cenat and other top creators – masterfully coaches creators through maximizing their virality. As MrBeast’s former manager, Duchscher helped cultivate the fast-paced, attention-grabbing style that transformed MrBeast from a YouTuber to an empire. He’s also behind Kai Cenat’s clipping strategy, though Duchscher isn’t quite as enthusiastic about its broader potential as Wei.

“Clipping is important if you’re a creator, because you do need to flood the zone with content, and it’s a good way to get your face out there,” Duchscher told TechCrunch. “It’s also very hard to get to scale, because there’s only so many clippers on the internet, so to spend large media budgets… there’s just a lot of complications.”

Perhaps clipping only works now because the technique has not yet become so prevalent that it’s seen as spam.

“The creator wins because they get more of their content out,” Wei said. “The clippers win because now this army of teenagers are getting paid. Everybody wins, except that if you take this to its logical conclusion, we just get lots and lots of slop.”

The prevalence of slop on social media has become enough of a threat that Merriam-Webster called slop its word of the year.

“Over 94% of people are saying that social media is no longer social, and over half of them are rotating time elsewhere into smaller niche communities that they know are real and that they can talk to and interact with,” Box said, pointing to platforms like Strava, LinkedIn, and Substack.

As the relationship between a creator and their audience becomes more difficult to maintain, Duchscher predicts that creators with more specific niches will succeed – he thinks that “macro creators” like MrBeast, PewDiePie, or Charli D’Amelio, who amass hundreds of millions of followers, will become even harder to emulate.

Pointing to success stories like like Alix Earle or Outdoor Boys, who have millions of followers but not necessarily mass appeal, Duchscher adds, “Algorithms have gotten so good at giving us exactly the content we want. It’s much harder for a creator to break out into every niche algorithm.”

Atkins agrees, arguing that the creator economy extends far beyond entertainment. “The creator economy generally is viewed through this lens of entertainment. I think that’s a mistake, because thinking about the creator economy is a little bit like thinking about the internet or AI – it’s going to affect everything.”

Atkins mentions the gardening creator brand Epic Gardening as an example. What started as a YouTube channel has created a real, tangible presence in the world of gardening.

“Epic Gardening bought the third largest seed company in the United States, so now he’s the third largest seed company [owner], as a content creator,” he said.

Though the creator economy is in flux, it’s a resilient industry – one that’s accustomed to navigating the whims of the algorithm, persisting onward for decades, even if the uninitiated may see it as a brand new realm.

Creators are “literally impacting everything,” Atkins said. “I bet you there’s a creator who’s an expert at cement mixing for skyscrapers.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/2025-was-the-year-ai-got-a-vibe-check/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Money was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.

OpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.

Such astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.

The first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.

The era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?

We’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.

The biggest AI labs got bigger this year.

In 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a Softbank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals, and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation. That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.

OpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds, its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states).

Then there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk also owns.

We’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.

Former OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion.

These absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.

For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.

The result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage.

Some of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:

But cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.

Whether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers – including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion – are already slowing projects in some regions.

Even as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.

In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.

While it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.

Even Gemini 3, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI – which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous ‘code red’ memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance.

There was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.

As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?

That shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay.

More than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.

OpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse, while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.

Google, for its part, is leaning on incumbency. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.

In a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.

AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” – the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes – sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.

While some copyright battles met their end – like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors – most are still unresolved. Though the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training, to demands for compensation (See: New York Times sues Perplexity for copyright infringement).

Meanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions – and their sycophantic responses – emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots.

Perhaps most telling: the calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.

Industry leaders have warned against chatbots “juicing engagement,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional over-reliance on ChatGPT.

Even the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy.

If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value.

The era of ‘trust us, the returns will come’ is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia. Time to place your bets.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There has been a flurry of AI voice recording gadgets like Omi, Bee, and Friend that want to capture your voice and let you converse with an AI chatbot. While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the Stream ring by Sandbar and a new AI ring from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices.

Amid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions.

The company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for preorder in August, two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry — and its ultra-thin design makes that easy.

At just 0.12 inches thick — about the width of three stacked credit cards — it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone.

The company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet.

One of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud.

Plaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation.

The recording device has impressive battery life. I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge.

Plaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content.

One problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level.

There is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to others in the meeting that you are recording the session.

You can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to. Plaud natively provides 300 minutes of free transcription every month. The company also lets you customize AI-generated notes through templates suited for different profiles and tasks. You can create your own template as well. The transcription is accurate in most instances, and now you can also access the recording, transcript, and notes through a website. The company has also addressed the problem my former colleague Brian Heater had of tapping on the word and not being played the corresponding recording.

While a pendant or pin-like form factor is possibly easier to carry, the card-sized recorder offers better microphones and more versatile placement options. It’s worth buying the $179 gadget if you take a lot of in-person meetings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.

That low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.

Electricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space.

And that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.

This confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.

For example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.

Gridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.

Several other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.

Base Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.

Other startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.

There’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.

Nvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.

These changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.

Utilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.

Software, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.

And that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.

A year ago, no one knew for sure whether Project 2025 would prove to be influential or if it would fall by the wayside, like so many plans in President Donald Trump’s first term. Today, it stands as the single most successful policy initiative of the entire Trump era.

Project 2025, which was convened by the Heritage Foundation during the Trump interregnum, was not just one thing: It was a policy white paper, an implementation plan, a recruitment database, and a worldview, all rolled into one. As I wrote in my book this past spring, the authors sought to create an agenda for the next right-wing president that would allow him to empower the executive branch, sideline Congress, and attack the civil service. The resulting politicized, quasi-monarchical government would enact policies that would move the United States toward a traditionalist Christian society.

In the roughly 11 months since he took office, Trump has closely followed many parts of Project 2025, finally embracing it by name in October. Both Trump and the plan’s architects have benefited: His second administration has been far more effective at achieving its goals than his first, and the thinkers behind Project 2025 have achieved what Paul Dans, one of its leaders, described as “way beyond” his “wildest dreams.”

Project 2025’s biggest victory has been an extraordinary presidential power grab, which has allowed Trump to act in ways that previous presidents have only fantasized about, and to act with fewer restraints. He has laid off tens of thousands of federal employees, sometimes in defiance of laws. More than 315,000 federal employees had left the government by mid-November, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Entire agencies, such as USAID, have been effectively shut down, and the Education Department may be next.

Elsewhere, the administration has slashed environmental regulations, withdrawn from a major international climate agreement, undermined renewable energy, and worked to encourage oil and gas drilling on public land. It has discarded key civil-rights-enforcement methods, dismantled anything that might be construed as DEI, and set the agenda for aggressive immigration policies, not just closing the border to many foreign nationals and deporting unauthorized immigrants but also cracking down on valid-visa holders and seeking to denaturalize citizens.

This is not small-government conservatism—it’s an effort to concentrate federal power and turn it into a political weapon. Long-standing guardrails against presidential interference in the Justice Department have been demolished. The White House has fired line prosecutors, and Trump has illegally appointed his own former personal attorneys to lead U.S. Attorney’s Offices. These prosecutors have brought charges against many of Trump’s political foes, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Representative LaMonica McIver; others have been placed under investigation. (Judges have thrown out indictments against Comey and James, though the DOJ is appealing those dismissals. McIver, who was indicted in June for allegedly impeding federal agents and interfering with an arrest, denies wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty.)

The administration has dabbled in impounding funds appropriated by Congress, despite a law barring this. It has also mounted a major assault on the independence of regulatory agencies, as established by Congress; Trump has fired multiple appointees, sometimes in apparent violation of law, but the Supreme Court has allowed him to proceed. Earlier this month, the justices heard arguments in a case that could overturn or severely narrow the 1935 precedent that safeguards agency independence. We already have a glimpse of what a fully politicized regulatory environment might look like: Chairman Brendan Carr, a Project 2025 author, has used his position at the Federal Communications Commission to pressure CBS News and ABC, even trying to get the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel fired earlier this year.

Trump’s presidential power grab will allow his administration to achieve more of Project 2025’s ambitions in the coming year and beyond. All of this has been enabled by a Republican-dominated Congress, which has with few exceptions allowed the president to seize legislative prerogatives, and by the Supreme Court, which has repeatedly allowed Trump to move forward on his expansion of power using the so-called shadow docket.

But Project 2025 has not been a complete success. One key belief of the authors was that Trump’s first administration was undercut by bad appointments and by failures to fill other roles. To that end, Project 2025 created a huge database of potential appointees and offered training courses. Although Trump has managed to find more aides loyal to him than in his first term, his pace of confirmation for top jobs trails the pace of most recent presidents. He has also seen a historic high in nominations withdrawn in the first year of a presidency.

More fundamentally, the Christian nationalism that courses through Project 2025 has been somewhat eclipsed by other priorities. The Trump administration has made few major moves to restrict access to abortion or to enact pronatalist policies, and the conservative Catholic writer Ross Douthat recently argued that Christianity seems to be window dressing in the administration’s policy rather than a real ideological driver of decision making. Big Tech was a notable boogeyman for the authors, who view smartphones and social media as a danger to traditional religious values, but major Silicon Valley figures have become hugely influential in the White House.

For the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 has been a somewhat Pyrrhic victory. Although its policy ideas are steering the administration, the think tank finds itself on the outside—a product, it seems, of Trump’s displeasure that coverage of Project 2025 complicated his campaign last year. Heritage is also fighting an intramural battle over how to handle the racist and anti-Semitic strains of the right.

Another, larger question looms. For decades, American conservatives have argued for restraints on government, in part out of fear of how progressives have used power to enact their policies. Project 2025 threw that out, embracing right-wing big government. Its unpopular ideas are one reason that Republicans are facing a daunting election environment in 2026 and perhaps 2028. If Project 2025’s authors felt, as Russell Vought once said, that America was “in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover” before Trump returned to office, they may find the situation even more apocalyptic if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2028—and inherits the sweeping powers they have handed to the White House.

All Hail Dead Week, the Best Week of the Year

Christmas is over and we have arrived at the most wonderful time of the year—nominally still the holidays, but also the opposite of a holiday, a blank space stretching between Christmas and New Year’s Eve when nothing makes sense and time loses its meaning …

In between the end of the old year and the beginning of the new one is this weird little stretch of unmarked time. For most people, this week isn’t even a week off from work, but at the same time it also isn’t a return to the normal rhythm of regular life. Nobody knows what to do with this leftover week, awkwardly stuck to the bottom of the year. I call it “Dead Week,” a time when nothing counts, and when nothing is quite real.

Listen. Here are the 10 best albums of 2025, according to our music critic Spencer Kornhaber.

            <h2>Why the Supreme Court Is Giving ICE So Much Power</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/ice-scotus-impunity/685298/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Untold numbers of ICE agents have appeared on America’s streets in recent months, and many of them have committed acts of aggression with seeming impunity. ICE agents have detained suspected illegal immigrants without cause—including U.S. citizens and lawful residents. They have, in effect, kidnapped people, breaking into cars to make arrests. They have used tear gas and pepper spray on nonviolent protesters. They have refused to identify themselves, wearing masks, using unmarked cars, and switching license plates, presumably to avoid detection. They have kept people in detention without access to lawyers. They have questioned people simply for appearing Latino, speaking Spanish, and being in areas believed to be frequented by illegal immigrants.

Many of these tactics are plainly illegal. The Constitution incontestably applies to federal immigration officers: The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and excessive force and requires a warrant to search a private home. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process and bans self-incrimination. The Sixth Amendment establishes a person’s right to counsel. Why, then, are they getting away with not following the Constitution?

Their impunity traces back to two Supreme Court decisions that put far too much faith in ICE’s commitment to respecting people’s constitutional rights. As a result of these cases, people whose rights are violated by ICE agents have little to no recourse. Contrast that with the rules for police officers. If a police officer kicks down your door and searches your home without a warrant, questions you without a Miranda warning, or illegally arrests you, a provision known as the exclusionary rule may prevent the evidence gathered through those tactics from being admitted in your prosecution. And if you happen to be acquitted, you can sue for damages. None of that is true when it comes to ICE.

The first of these two cases is a 1984 decision, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, that untethered ICE from the exclusionary rule. In a 5–4 opinion, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor rejected the exclusionary rule for immigration courts, favoring, instead, “a deliberately simple deportation hearing system.” In a typical criminal case, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct—the idea being that the police will avoid such conduct if it risks undermining a conviction. But for ICE, the Court decided, such deterrence is not necessary. Unless ICE conduct amounts to an “egregious” violation of the Fourth Amendment, the evidence that agents gather even through illegal means can be used in immigration courts. Key to the Court’s decision was a presumption that Fourth Amendment violations by ICE officers were not “widespread” and that the Immigration and Naturalization Service “has already taken sensible and reasonable steps to deter Fourth Amendment violations by its officers.” Such assumptions may not have been reasonable then; they are certainly not reasonable now.

A second Court decision appears to have eliminated, or at least seriously limited, the possibility of lawsuits for damages after individuals are unlawfully detained, searched, or experience excessive force at the hands of ICE. When the police engage in misconduct, the victim can sue the responsible officers for damages. Again, not so for ICE. In the 2022 decision Egbert v. Boule, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, denied the rights of plaintiffs to sue Border Patrol agents for excessive use of force in the name of “national security.” There is every reason to believe that the Supreme Court would extend the rationale in Boule to shield ICE from liability as well. The Court would effectively be greenlighting ICE’s abusive tactics and insulating agents from damages when they are, in fact, no different from any state or city police officer who violates a person’s constitutional rights. As in INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, the rationale in Boule relies on the agency’s purported ability to self-regulate; after all, Thomas suggested, Border Patrol “must investigate ‘alleged violations’ and accept grievances.” Can anyone count on such care to come from Border Patrol under this administration? Again, the faith in these institutions to self-regulate seems tragically misplaced.

The remaining options for someone mistreated by ICE are inadequate, to say the least. An individual could file a lawsuit under the Federal Torts Claims Act against federal officers, but that law has its shortcomings: A person must submit a detailed claim to the government and wait for a response before they can go to court. That process can take years and years. An individual could also file a complaint with the DHS Office of Inspector General or the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which would theoretically launch an investigation, but in this administration, the chances of redress for misconduct are slim to none. Nothing drives the point home more than the case of a CBP commander, Gregory Bovino. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found that he had lied to the court about whether he had used excessive force against protesters in Chicago. Was he dismissed or disciplined? Neither; he went on to lead another immigration sweep, this time in New Orleans.

Then there are the practical problems with contesting ICE misconduct. Where in the United States is the immigrant? In which detention facility? Do they have a lawyer? Worse, what if they have already been deported through a process known as expedited removal? Expedited removal generally involves a determination by a low-level immigration officer who, in many cases during a single interview, determines that the noncitizen arrived in the U.S. without proper documents and therefore cannot prove that he or she has been physically present in the U.S. for two years. (Exceptions are made only for people who have a credible fear of persecution or torture, or who intend to apply for asylum—exceptions that have been severely limited under this administration.) Although expedited removal used to apply only to noncitizens within 100 miles of the border, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has expanded the policy to apply to any unlawful noncitizen anywhere in the country who cannot prove two years of residency, giving them no time to secure counsel or gather evidence, no right to appeal, and surely no meaningful due process.

Even for those who manage to get before an immigration judge, the process is formidable. ICE attorneys have been systematically asking immigration judges to dismiss proceedings in order to strip individuals of even the limited protections those hearings afford. Judge Jia Cobb, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., noted in a recent decision that people have been arrested immediately following dismissals, subjected to expedited removal, and shortly removed. These tactics, combined with the administration’s expanded policy of mandatory detention—meaning the immigrant is not entitled to bail—have turned immigration courts into what the former chief counsel for Joe Biden’s Citizenship and Immigration Services characterized as a “deportation pipeline.”

Much of what ICE is doing is not remotely constitutional. The Court decisions that laid the groundwork for the agency’s lawlessness no longer stand up to basic scrutiny. As Justice O’Connor said in INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, “our conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule’s value might change, if there developed good reason to believe that Fourth Amendment violations by INS officers were widespread.” There’s more than good reason; there’s every reason.</div>

            <h2>Mary Todd Lincoln, Taken Out of Context</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/oh-mary-theater-trump/685446/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By now, you will be used to the feminist practice of finding a historical woman and rescuing her from the clutches of evil biographers who have done her dirty. What if Marie Antoinette or Typhoid Mary were a more rounded figure—more constrained by the expectations of her time, perhaps, or a victim of her circumstances and upbringing?

That is not the approach that the playwright Cole Escola has taken in Oh, Mary!, which is currently playing on Broadway and has just opened in London. Escola’s question about Mary Todd Lincoln, wife and widow of America’s 16th president, is this: What if she were an absolute monster? The idea for the show came from an email Escola sent to themselves in 2009, which read: “Write a play (maybe musical?) about Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln in which it comes out being a good thing that Abe Lincoln dies.”

To fulfill that brief, the 39-year-old playwright has taken the Mary of the historical record—a laudanum user, prone to wild mood swings and shopping sprees, eventually confined to an asylum by her own son—and made her worse. This Mary drinks paint thinner and pushes her companion, Louisa, down the stairs. Above all, she desperately wants to be a cabaret star, and believes that Abraham has thwarted her dream. Fatally, he reacts to her constant complaints by hiring a handsome actor—whose identity becomes important later in the plot—to give her lessons for the “legitimate theater.”

Read: What the U.S. could learn from an Irish theater

Having already seen the show on Broadway, I was curious to know how such a quintessentially American story would land in Britain. (No one here could pick Mary Todd Lincoln out of a first-lady lineup, even though this is the second play about her to open in London in 2025.) How does a show whose satirical power comes from cutting against received wisdom deal with the audience having no idea what that received wisdom is? The answer is: Training wheels and a reliance on physical comedy help, up to a point.

In London, the play begins with a straightforward exposition dump: A preshow voiceover establishes Mary Todd Lincoln as the wife of President Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated by the actor John Wilkes Booth. Oh, Mary!, shorn of its political resonance, falls squarely into an established populist British stage tradition: pantomime, in which unwitting 7-year-olds are corralled into a theater at Christmastime to watch well-worn favorites such as Aladdin or Dick Whittington and His Cat, a folktale in which a young man (always played by a woman) leaves home to make his fortune in London. Pantomime leans heavily on popular songs, risqué jokes, and melodrama, just like Oh, Mary!

In addition to writing the play, Escola originated the lead role, playing Mary as a 19th-century Veruca Salt, all wobbling curls and petulantly folded arms. “Mary is just me,” Escola once told NPR. “It’s all based on me and my feelings, and all of my characters are some aspect of me that I’m ashamed of or curious about.” Since then, the Marys have tended to be either queer actors or gay icons, underlining the show’s immersion in gay culture. (Mary repeatedly addresses a portrait of George Washington as “Mother,” and this Abraham Lincoln is gay, too.) The London Mary is played by the nonbinary actor Mason Alexander Park, best known for portraying Ariel in Jamie Lloyd’s truly cursed production of The Tempest.

I saw the play on Broadway with the drag queen Jinkx Monsoon, who followed Escola and others, and was herself followed by Jane Krakowski. The role does not call for subtlety. “I have to imagine that somewhere along the line someone had to have told you, ‘You’re a little too big,’” Monsoon told Krakowski in September. “I’ve been told that a billion times.”

When I saw Monsoon’s (yes, very big) performance, I did think, snobbily: Oh, look, the Americans have discovered panto. I wasn’t alone. The London reviews have been positive, but the two harshest ones described the show as “sophomoric” and “farce at its broadest” (The Guardian) and “a bit … ’70s? A little bit Airplane!, a little bit Benny Hill, maybe even a touch of Mr Bean” (Time Out). In the British context, these reviewers implied, Oh, Mary!’s humor reads as dated rather than groundbreaking. That’s largely because of the pantomime tradition. I was brought up on this genre, which also usually features a dame (always played by a man: In a production of Aladdin, Ian McKellen once gave a fantastic Widow Twankey) and volleys of double entendres for parents. The title character in Dick Whittington has a cat mostly so all the other characters can remark on his “lovely pussy.”

This is the energy that Escola has brought to Oh, Mary! Todd Lincoln, under her prim crinoline, is wearing red-and-white-striped bloomers, which is very panto. And just like a panto, the staging is deliberately lo-fi: two static sets, a wheeled-on theater box, and a bit of front-of-curtain business. On Broadway, The New York Times described it as having “the cheesy naturalism of community theater.”

What Escola has built on this foundation, however, is truly unhinged. Do you remember the end of Inglourious Basterds, when Quentin Tarantino kills off the entire Nazi Party in an exploding movie theater? Yeah, about that unhinged. Mary might be awful, but Escola makes her pathetic too, with her terrible loneliness and her deluded belief that she could have been a star. “I don’t even want to be alive,” she tells her acting teacher at the start of their first lesson. More than anything else, she is bored—a default condition for humanity before smartphones and reliable Wi-Fi. History isn’t just battles and bowers; it’s privileged people in gilded rooms waiting for death or the invention of streaming services, whichever comes first. For aristocratic women, this boredom was particularly acute, because their enforced inactivity was a status symbol. The Mitford sisters, growing up in rural Oxfordshire in the 1920s, found their lives so tedious that they invented, as one of them put it, “a contest to see who could best stand being pinched really hard.” This sounds exactly like something Escola’s Mary would inflict on her companion, Louisa.

Earlier this year, Oh, Mary! was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, an award that  in 2016 went to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton. As it happens, I rewatched Hamilton not long ago, and its earnest paeans to diversity (“Immigrants, we get the job done”) now feel like the last gasp of the Obama era.

When Hamilton first came to Britain, I wrote that its blend of rap, classical music, and Gilbert and Sullivan operettas showed that it “speaks all the cultural languages of America, and it echoes Obama’s ability to change cadences depending on his audience.” Added to that, by offering cheap tickets in a daily street lottery alongside the usual sky-high prices of Broadway, “Miranda created a fan base that mirrors the ‘Obama coalition’ of Democrat voters: college-educated coastal liberals and mid-to-low-income minorities.” Hamilton might have been great entertainment, but it also took seriously the idea of educating America about its history, in a spirit now continued by the popular Substack historian Heather Cox Richardson.

Read: Watching Hamilton is like opening a time capsule

Like Hamilton, Oh, Mary! uses color-conscious casting, reframing white historical figures by having nonwhite actors play them. And like Hamilton, it is an improbable box-office smash: It became the first production to gross more than $1 million a week at the Lyceum Theater in New York. But otherwise, the two plays could not be more different. Instead of Obama-era earnestness, Oh, Mary! is steeped in the signature moods of the Trump era: pure camp, twisted humor, and lol nothing matters nihilism. (Think: Donald Trump dancing to “YMCA,” or the casual cruelty of all those deportation videos.) Escola did “less than no research” into Mary Todd Lincoln, to avoid the temptation of writing in-jokes. “I wanted to have the same knowledge that the audience had,” Escola told Seth Meyers. “I didn’t want to do research and then be making jokes about, like, ‘Well, that’ll get a laugh ’cause that’s where she was born.’” This artistic decision worked out well for me, a person who had no idea where Mary Todd Lincoln was born until I looked it up for this article.

The audience also learns precisely nothing about Mary’s divided loyalties—she was born in Kentucky, and several of her half-brothers fought for the Confederacy. Her real-life grief over the death of her sons Eddie and Willie is completely absent; Mary assures her acting teacher that “I never go near the children.” Even the Civil War barely gets a look-in. When Abraham complains about fighting with the South, Mary growls, “The South of what?!” His announcement of the end of the war is included only to set up a contrast with Mary’s activities that afternoon—discovering that Louisa “wants to rub ice cream on her pussy!”

In its absolute refusal to take history seriously, Oh, Mary! is basically the anti-Hamilton. But then, we are living through the mirror image of the Obama era right now. Escola’s Mary is a monster, but also a ham, a narcissist, and a born entertainer—and the audience ends up glued to her every move. I mean, you could suggest a parallel with contemporary America there. Or you could just enjoy the wigs and the gags and the spotted bloomers.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you went to the movies this fall, you probably met him: the Sad Art Dad. You’ll have known him by his miserableness; despite the flash of the cameras and the cheers of the groundlings, he’s most often found moping alone. His vocation may vary—movie star (in Jay Kelly), art-house director (Sentimental Value), blockbuster Tudor playwright (Hamnet)—but his problem tends to be the same. He has chosen great art over good parenting, utterly failing as a father, and he knows it. There’s something delicious about his cocktail of self-pity and self-loathing, which can arouse both the viewer’s repulsion and compassion. It may not be much fun to be a Sad Art Dad, but it’s certainly fun to watch one.

The distant and distracted patriarch, although abundant on-screen in 2025, is not a novel invention. Yet most movie dads are more likely to be found balancing stellar careers and model parenting (lawyer-dad in To Kill A Mockingbird; Mob-dad in the Godfather films) than exhibiting—let alone acknowledging—their fatherly flaws. Sometimes prioritizing professional ambitions is even depicted as admirable: In Interstellar, Matthew McConaughey plays an astronaut who abandons his kids for a decades-long space mission, but only in order to save humanity. The character might beat himself up for it, but the viewer understands that it’s a pretty good excuse, as far as they go.

What’s different about this new cinematic crop of dads is their culpability. They each choose themselves over their kids, prioritizing creative fulfillment. George Clooney’s titular A-lister in Noah Baumbach’s Jay Kelly admits as much when trying to explain his years-long absence to his now-adult daughter: “I wanted something very badly,” he says, “and I thought if I took my eye off of it, I couldn’t have it.” At least Jay is trying to apologize. When Gustav (played by Stellan Skarsgård), the ornery patriarch of Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value, is accused by his daughter Nora (Renate Reinsve) of never having watched her perform, he defends himself by saying that he doesn’t like theater. Meanwhile, in Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) likes the theater a bit too much. Although he’s a much more affectionate parent than Jay or Gustav, the Bard’s absence—he gallops away from plaguey Stratford-upon-Avon to the Elizabethan West End—has calamitous consequences for his kids.

Read: Parenting is the least of her worries

But these films are not pat condemnations of the flawed fathers they depict; they illustrate, sometimes with seeming ambivalence, the consequences of such self-absorption. Tellingly, Sentimental Value’s most tender scene doesn’t feature Gustav at all. Instead, it’s a quiet moment between Nora and her sister, Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Having finally read Gustav’s latest screenplay, and found within it surprising echoes of the darkest periods of her own life, an emotional Nora sits on her bedroom floor beside her sister. The script is so uncannily accurate, Agnes notes, that it’s as though their father had been there for Nora’s suffering. “Well, he wasn’t,” Nora replies. “You were.”

It’s a gorgeous demonstration of familial love that also lays bare the true cost of the Sad Art Dad’s narcissism. He has made himself redundant; his children have learned, painfully, to cope without him. The same specter of redundancy haunts both Hamnet and Jay Kelly. When Shakespeare arrives home after tragedy strikes, he finds that he’s too late to help his family. He then announces his intent to return to London—and his wife, Agnes (Jessie Buckley), slaps him. Jay’s daughter Jess (Riley Keough) tells her father with brutal candor not to worry about her: “I’m gonna have a good life, just not with you.” A memorable shot in Sentimental Value shows Gustav standing alone on a Normandy beach, his hulking, black-suited figure marooned against miles of sand and scudding lilac clouds. The price of failed fatherhood, it seems, is loneliness.

Does the Sad Art Dad regret his choices? Is making great art—which, in these films, has a capacious, allegorical quality—worth ruining your relationship with your kids? Each of these movies tries to convince us, with varying degrees of success, that prioritizing your artistic endeavors offers emotional compensation. Hamnet, for instance, ends with a delicately choreographed moment of parental connection. Agnes, standing in the audience at the Globe Theatre, reaches out to grasp the hand of the young actor playing Hamlet; in the film’s version of the play, the tragic boy-hero is named for her dead son. Moving though it is, the scene’s mawkishness renders it unpersuasive: Agnes’s abrupt pivot from bitterly resenting her husband to forgiving him strains credulity. A play, even a Shakespeare play, is no substitute for a child.

Read: Two different ways of understanding fatherhood

Jay Kelly also considers the case for putting your craft before your kids, but only half-heartedly. It toys with the idea that the magic of the movies at least partially justifies Jay’s parental negligence; the film ends on a long close-up of Jay’s face as he watches a retrospective reel of his career, visibly moved. But the film ultimately gives up trying to convince the audience that the art was worth the human cost. In its closing line, Jay asks, fruitlessly, for a chance to live his life over again. Measured against the wreckage of his relationships, Hollywood’s comforts prove chilly even to the movie star.

Sentimental Value’s vision of film as a doorway to empathy and repair is by far the most compelling. Gustav’s script may dwindle beside the compassion his daughters offer each other, yet his transformation of Nora’s pain into art is still an act of love. As Agnes says to her sister: “I think he wrote it for you.” Gustav’s work, we realize, is more empathetic, more attentive to other people, than he is. His daughters might find this to be a bitter-tasting irony, but the consolation is real—particularly for an actor like Nora, who eventually finds creative catharsis playing the part Gustav based on her.

Oddly, despite his inadequacies, the Sad Art Dad suggests a promising cultural shift on-screen. To pay attention to the idea of flawed fatherhood, after all, is to think seriously about what constitutes its opposite, the good dad. Laura Dern’s unsentimental divorce lawyer says it well in Baumbach’s Marriage Story, which is also about depressed dads: “The idea of a good father was only invented, like, 30 years ago.” As such, it’s striking to find three films out at the same time that are gnawed by such similar anxieties. Perhaps Joachim Trier put it best: “Tenderness is the new punk.”</div>

For sickness and diseases.  Excellent governance!  Let&#39;s kill scientific research, hand away the future, and get more of us killed.

But why do you need to spend money on &quot;research&quot; when you can pray for free?

Indulgences, like the rest of the practices of the catholic sect, are a heresy. Remember, Jeebus threw all the merchants, including the afterlife insurance salesmen, out of the temple.

Hot, fervent hail marys, on the other hand, backed by a firm belief will work miracles, Allah willing.

China is recruiting biotech talent from the US? Like they&#39;re saying go work in China and save up money? I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone do it unless the offer was so great that you&#39;d have enough money to outright buy a US home at the end of it. As in, be able to save like $700k within 7 years (which in 7 years should get you a &quot;todays&quot; $500k home in the US). That means you&#39;d have to get paid around like $180k (after China taxes if they make you pay that). I blindly assume China comfortable expat living expenses are like 80k.

As for &quot;you&#39;re helping China advance&quot; .. well don&#39;t on any circumstances tell them how to do anything that would give them a national security advantage .. but if it&#39;s something like a rare disease or cancer cure that all humanity could benefit from and your own country isn&#39;t offering you shit then why not. When you get back you can always make that cure in the US.

Lets wait 3 months more and see if that statement still holds true. Business analysts expect RAM prices to increase throughout 2026, stabilize at 2026 price level throughout 2027 and increase in price yet again in 2028.

&quot;You will own nothing and be happy about it&quot;, that is future planned for you and the rest of us slobs in the trenches.

Seriously, where is a good Robespierre&#39;s when society needs one...

The crazy thing is that the price increases have already made Appleâ(TM)s infamously ludicrous upgrade pricing seem reasonable.  Apple want Â£400 for 32GB.  A couple of months ago, that was 4 times over the going rate.  Now itâ(TM)s pretty much normal.  The cheepest DDR5 6000 on newegg is Â£330, and higher bandwidth stuff costs of the order of Â£5-600.  (And thatâ(TM)s ignoring that Appleâ(TM)s on chip RAM is anywhere between 50% faster and 300% faster th

Because youâ(TM)re a nerd probably.  That said, the article seems to motivate things rather poorly.

I donâ(TM)t get how anyone would ever expect this to be cheep though.  The reason RAM is expensive is because the production capacity for chips is being used to produce GPU RAM for AI data centres, not because thereâ(TM)s some disconnect between chip prices and DIMM prices.  Buying the chips is going to be just as expensive, because the chips, and production capacity are needed elsewhere.  What

I&#39;m more upset because the &quot;dept.&quot; field was apparently populated by someone who doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually supposed to be &quot;desperate-times-call-for-drastic-measures.&quot;

the problem isn&#39;t that people aren&#39;t assembling ddr5 -- the problem is the dram isn&#39;t available.

Pretty sure I&#39;ve seen this story already. Someone commented about alternate memory packaging designs completely missing it is the actual chips that are in short supply.

This came out of The Socials. It&#39;s just for clicks.

It&#39;s worth it to him to assemble a module at the same cost as retail, because the YouTube Partner program pays him to take a video of it.

Yeah, this doesn&#39;t really help unless a bunch of DDR5 DRAM chips fall off of the truck somewhere. Probably one headed to an OpenAI data center being built somewhere that doesn&#39;t have power yet.

Building your own module still requires chips! This is just stupid, adding unneeded complexity of building your own when it doesn&#39;t solve the initial issue.

This is Russia we&#39;re talking about. A slightly bigger problem in obtaining the modules thanks to their invasion causing sanctions.

The cost &quot;savings&quot; aren&#39;t there either - the actual cost of the DIY modules rivals that of actual DDR5 RAM kits.

In the end all the Russians do with that precious RAM is bolt it onto a drone with C4 and send it into residential areas in neighboring countries. They don&#39;t care.

Pay enough and someone somewhere will make the dram chips for the right price.

The reason memory is expensive is because there&#39;s only a certain amount of manufacturing capacity for the chips, not the fucking circuit boards. If it were the circuit boards, we could spin up factories in days to make new DIMMs.

Come on editors, do better. This article is either by a troll or by complete morons. Either way it doesn&#39;t deserve a place here.

Assuming by the downvotes you must be both 100% correct and directly countering the propaganda. The internet is absolutely flooded with pro-Russia and pro-China apologetic posts these last weeks: here, on X, HN, reddit - it&#39;s everywhere I look and it&#39;s really obvious. Anything countering it is immediately moderated and removed, but these bots seem to have complete freedom.

Yes, my first thought exactly. This &quot;story&quot; is without any insight whatsoever.

The price-hike is NOT for the PCBs. It is for the memory chips. What they are doing makes absolutely no sense except very temporarily. It is in no way a solution for the problem.

... if the Russians were weaving their own magnetic core memory.

We&#39;ve buried all the silicon in the tulip fields.

The word has been so abused that I become suspicious every time I hear it.

Indeed. And when the &quot;innovation&quot; is &quot;Weyland on Gnome&quot;. Seriously, I do not use either and I do not plan to. I just want my systems to work.

That&#39;s an innovation in almost exactly the way that crapping on the office floor is.

Seriously? Gnome does not give you a choice of focus-follows-mouse? What backward defective wannabe-level crap is that piece of software? Now I will look even less at it than I had planned (which was &quot;never&quot;).

Any sane Window-Manager just gives you a choice. My fvwm has now been configured for focus-follows-mouse for something like 35 years and I had one (!) easy configuration change in all that time when fvwm2 came out. And that is it. This thing needs to work as I want it to and do so long term. Nothing el

Of course it gives you that option. Just activate it in Gnome Tweaks. You have the choice between:

Click to FocusFocus on HoverFocus Follows Mouse

What pisses me off is that the entire justification for wasting 15 years to develop a &quot;replacement&quot; for X11 ended up being obsoleted by technologies that could easily have been foreseen in 2010. cgroups in Linux means every application can be given its own authentication token for the X server, allowing X clients to be given application-by-application security. No need to send everything to everything any more. And full backward compatibility is possible. All that&#39;s needed is for the Xorg team to implement the protocol. ...which they won&#39;t do because it&#39;d be admitting that the entire last 15 years producing a slower, less efficient, display system with fewer features and some really boneheaded limitations, and making the rest of the community write awkward kludge-ridden desktops around it was a complete waste of time and money that could have been spent on (1) the three months needed to implement security and (2) fixing bugs and bringing other improvements to Xorg.

RedHat&#39;s &quot;contributions&quot; over the last 20 years:  Making XFS the default rather than ext4, removing Btrfs, introducing Systemd, PulseAudio, PipeWire, DBus, Wayland, Podman, corporate telemetry reporting, dropping 32-bit and fbcon. Aka, all the annoying shit we don&#39;t like that makes Linux into an incompatible, monolithic, &quot;opinionated&quot;, corporatized operating system. And let&#39;s not forget how they closed their source code.

Well before IBM acquired them, RedHat has been slowly corrupting and subverting the entire Linux ecosystem to serve its own corporate interests. Because they&#39;re the largest player, they effectively force everyone else to follow suit, or face not being compatible.

I think you&#39;re going to get your way, but it&#39;s going to be the undoing of yourself and your employer.

Spoken like someone with a conflict of interest and a strong delusion about how much public good will their employer has left to burn through before becoming themselves irrelevant.

I just remember my driving licence number. They type it into the system, my face pops up, quick visual check. Done.

I had a situation once where I was going hiking on the morning of 1 Jan and the police set up a blockade at the entrance to my local motorway to breathalyse everyone after the New Year&#39;s Eve. The conversation went like this:

Office: Do you have your driving licence with you?Me: I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t. But I remember its serial number if that helps?Officer: You remember your licence number?Me: Yeah, its ABCDEFG123456HI78JK.Officer: ... Alright, mate.

Watch the videos. You are not handing the phone to anybody

Personally if I am approached by a police officer, I&#39;m putting all my digital devices into lockdown. When you&#39;re being pulled over or detained, you&#39;re on the losing side of a power dynamic and in no circumstance would I ever advise anyone to physically present a phone to a police officer even if you think it is just going to be an innocent NFC tap. To me that is inviting trouble. Yes, in theory your phone is still locked. Yes in theory, the officer can&#39;t just take your phone willy nilly. And in theory, Appl

To hand my phone unlocked over to the police.

No, you can hand over your phone locked - your driver&#39;s license will be shown on the lock screen. You&#39;d unlock your phone, tell the wallet app to display your ID then lock your phone and your ID will be displayed on the screen.

You don&#39;t need to to unlock your phone to find an item in an Apple Wallet, you just double-click the side button to invoke Apple Pay and flick through the cards till you get to the one you&#39;re after. No unlocking at all, and the act of double-clicking also simultaneously triggers the FaceID authentication that ensures you are able to tap-to-authenticate.

The point is for people to feel like they got some kind of sci-fi gadget for their $1000. Also they&#39;d like for you to feel that it&#39;s mandatory to carry at all times.

Not being readers, the audience doesn&#39;t realize this is dystopian sci-fi. Like, the kind you don&#39;t want.

Cop pulls me over, the phone has been shut down. Handing them your phone with digital license is just invitation for them to go plug your phone into a moblie forensics tool and go fishing..

Seriously, hand over your license and registration and proof of insurance paper and refuse to agree to any searches, refuse to answer any questions (politely) and ask if you are free to go.

These digital wallets are just pretense to get you to unknowingly give consent for a search

Also notice that most of the states into this are police-friendly states already.

It&#39;s weird seeing blue states allowing this, and red states getting onboard with technology when they also want voter ID and all that stuff.

It&#39;s been years since I used PHYSICAL driving license, car registration, IDs at airport, credit /debit cards, educational certificates, life or other insurance certificates and even property papers (to some limited extent - only urban and only if bought recently in last 5-8 years)

OR depended on a specific manufacturer&#39;s App like Apple Google Samsung wallets for these things.

The US is light years ahead of the world in most aspects but really lagging behind in some things that matter. Including payment system

I&#39;m not sure a driver&#39;s license on a phone is &quot;advanced.&quot; Sometimes, technology isn&#39;t an actual improvement.

Wait, if you&#39;re AmiMoJo, you&#39;re British, right? So how have you got through airport security without showing a physical passport?? Boarding cards, sure. But physical passport is still needed, is it not? Also, while I can indeed pull up the airline app to access my boarding card, it&#39;s massively *less* convenient than adding it to Apple Wallet and being able to use the features that provides eg appearing automatically on the lock screen as a notification for convenience once boarding time approaches.

Officer, I was driving 50mph over the speed limit with my lights off at night in a stolen car with no plates, the wrong way down an Interstate highway, and as you can see by the empty bottles around me, my blood alcohol level is higher than your IQ.  Why would you expect me to have a license?

I don&#39;t understand what problem this is supposed to solve.

One less thing to take out with you and risk having it be lost or stolen. The risk already exists with your phone unless you&#39;re very unusual, and at least with your phone it&#39;s somewhat hard for a thief to access the data, whereas your driving licence has crucial information right there on it ready to be used by anyone who can get their hands on it. The main benefit is convenience, which you may not value that much but which others may.

There&#39;s some obvious risks to making driver&#39;s licences digital, but there

Let&#39;s be honest. It must be pretty empty in the non-tech job market at the moment. But if you studied fine arts... perhaps these sort of difficulties were not that difficult to predict.

Regardless, I wouldn&#39;t be terribly impressed with a person using a hookup site to get work.

If you do anything art related, not only do you need to network, but you need to have your &quot;break out&quot; moment or else you&#39;ll never really do particularly well. And you won&#39;t stand a chance at that unless you can get on the good side of people in your industry. Not willing to perform sexual favors? Your politics aren&#39;t the same as theirs? You hang out with the wrong crowd? Good luck. It&#39;s doable, but you&#39;ll really have to be on the far top side of the bell curve. Those big fancy award ceremonies you see aren

The issue for &quot;Networking&quot; on Hinge or Bumble or Tinder is you set yourself up for being used for sex, and get very little in return. Going to a party of hinge people sounds like the networking is going to be more like getting a train run on you than getting a job.

Turning everything into a red light / green light tree of checklist questions, thanks to 10 years of dating apps warping minds, has led us here.

- First - Dating apps and their imbalance of women getting flooded with likes and 80% of men getting little or no likes- Second - Job search candidate filtering from the employer side.  Turing screening job candidates against an increasing in size set of red flag knockout questions- Third - AI on top of this with AI filled out resumes, job applications, cover letter

An interesting idea, but what if you&#39;re a non-skinny woman, or a man under six feet?

An interesting idea, but what if you&#39;re a non-skinny woman, or a man under six feet?Good point. Seriously - this approach is an embarrassment. And there comes a point where a person has to perform, which is not always correlated with physical appearance. And I take it that whoever her date is, when she&#39;s at the party, he has to be okay with being abandoned while she looks for work.  Sounds like a horrible path.

Well then you can&#39;t take advantage of desperate men.

This strikes me as a subtle type of catfishing. It also occurs that you could use a fake photo, because what&#39;s the guy gonna do after he gets you an interview--tell HR she didn&#39;t look like her photo? (Note that the guy probably isn&#39;t a CEO or something--almost all companies pay attention to referrals and recommendations.)

An interesting idea, but what if you&#39;re a non-skinny woman, or a man under six feet?More to the point, dating apps already suck for young men. It&#39;s hard enough for them to get a match of any kind, and the apps are notorious for women ghosting men or going out with men just to get a free meal or monetary favor of some kind. Now imagine finding out that the only reason a woman goes out with you was to use you for your work connections. How is this not a kind of catfishing or fraud?I tell my sons to avoid these apps like the plague. This kind of stuff only reinforces that.

So Tiffany Chau used a dating platform as ploy to get a job interview rather than to actually find a date.  Perhaps the &quot;date&quot; prospect lucked out that it didn&#39;t lead to anything further.

I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve encountered more obnoxious things recently... like a tech news site that constantly links to paywalled news articles :)

It&#39;s pretty disgusting behavior IMO, but on the other hand, a girl&#39;s got to eat.

If you don&#39;t have a connection, don&#39;t go on the date, and it won&#39;t happen to you.

I suspect its more like quid pro quo than networking

Sure, you could. but *should* you? Probably not. In both cases, you&#39;re more likely to annoy people and get blocked, than to accomplish your goal.

Standard procedure in Hollywood; as this scene from Scream 3 exemplifies...

So put out or get out...now in the tech market. The new golden age is continuing...

            <h2>One State Supreme Court’s Lazy “Shortcut” Erases Civil Rights</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/colorado-supreme-court-civil-rights-constitution.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This piece was originally published in the Behind the Bench newsletter on state constitutional law. Behind the Bench is published by the State Law Research Initiative.

It can be astonishing, and more than a little depressing, to see the lengths some courts go to avoid upholding basic constitutional rights. In June, I wrote about how the North Carolina Supreme Court’s Republican majority dilutes civil rights by requiring claimants to prove that challenged state actions, including discriminatory laws, are “unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.” The problem, as liberal Justice Anita Earls pointed out, is that “either the statute is consistent with the constitution or not,” and the “notion that you have to somehow establish that beyond a reasonable doubt makes no sense”—except, of course, as an excuse to erode civil rights.

Today, I bring your attention to the Colorado Supreme Court, which this month reaffirmed an inexplicable quirk of its excessive sentencing jurisprudence that preemptively extinguishes constitutional rights for entire categories of people. The court declares certain crimes to be “per se grave or serious,” which in practice means that no one convicted of such crimes can ever challenge their sentence, no matter its severity. The long-standing rule is both wholly illogical and blatantly unconstitutional (in the sense that it erases constitutional rights), but there is some good news: It appears that two justices are finally ready to, in their words, “deep six this concept.”

Colorado’s state constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual” punishment, including excessive or “disproportionate” prison terms. To assess excessive punishment claims, Colorado courts begin by comparing “the gravity or seriousness of the offense to the harshness of the penalty.” Normally, Colorado case law takes a relatively capacious view of how a crime’s “gravity” should be measured. It accounts not just for the offense and its elements but also for potentially mitigating factors such as whether the person “was an accessory, complicitor, or principal,” along with the person’s “culpability and motive.” In theory, this definition captures how personal characteristics (such as youth, disability, or addiction) and other circumstances (such as the role of group dynamics, poverty, or coercive relationships) might reduce someone’s culpability and factor into the constitutional analysis.

But for some offenses, the Colorado Supreme Court—and only the Colorado Supreme Court—has devised what it calls “the ‘per se’ shortcut.” Under this rule, the court “designate[s] certain crimes ‘per se grave or serious,’ ” which, the court says, renders a sentence all but “impervious to attack on proportionality grounds.” In other words, the court’s justices have decided they will not do their jobs for people who have certain convictions. Rather than actually assess excessive punishment claims in light of all the factors the law requires, they will just assume that these claims fail, giving prosecutors and legislators free rein to pursue the sort of punitive excess that has fueled mass incarceration for decades.

And it’s not like this rule has been reserved for what might intuitively be the most violent, high-culpability crimes. Robbery, for example, remains “per se grave or dangerous” even though the circumstances under which robberies take place vary wildly, as do the characteristics of the people who commit them (more on that below). Even worse, for nearly 30 years Colorado courts put all drug offenses, including mere possession, on this list until a “clarify[ing]” decision in 2019 finally changed that. (It took decades for the Colorado Supreme Court to realize that it “makes little sense to automatically treat the sale of a large quantity of cocaine by the leader of a drug cartel as equally grave or serious as the mere possession of a very small quantity of cocaine by a drug addict who is not involved in sale or distribution.”)

The court concedes that this “shortcut” is “unique to Colorado law” and that it “eliminates a longstanding layer of due process for criminal defendants.” Nonetheless, it remains on the books because it supposedly “saves time” and promotes “consistency.” I would submit that “saving time” is never a good reason to dispense with constitutional rights, but the court’s claims to efficiency are dubious in any case. Now, instead of properly analyzing its cruel and unusual clause, the court spends its time hopelessly trying to figure out what on earth “per se grave or serious” actually means and what offenses it applies to. With this rule in place, and with prosecutors thirsty to invoke it, the first part of every excessive punishment analysis turns into Tom Cruise cross-examining Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men: Q: “Grave Danger?” A: [Raises eyebrow] “Is there another kind?”

But there is a glimmer of hope. In People v. Kennedy, decided earlier this month, Justices Carlos Samour and Richard Gabriel “specially concurred” to advocate nixing the per se grave or serious shortcut.

In Kennedy, the court stood by its shortcut and upheld the 24-year prison term at issue. But it also held that vehicular homicide–DUI is not “per se grave or serious” because it is a strict liability crime with no specific intent element. “When a crime requires no proof of mens rea,” the court said, “it is impossible to evaluate the culpability of defendants convicted of the offense under every factual scenario.”

It is good that the court declined to expand the shortcut to cover a new offense, but the analytical problem here is that the same reasoning applies to crimes that do require proof of intent. To use an example mentioned above, the court thinks that people who commit robbery have sufficiently high culpability “under every factual scenario”—a conclusion that can only be understood as the willful ignorance of reality. Just a few other facts one might want to know: How old is the person? Are they a youth or emerging adult under age 25, and therefore more susceptible to peer pressure and impulsive decisionmaking? Was the person coerced by an abusive partner or authority figure? Did the person use a weapon and if so what kind? Was it a gun that turned out to be fake? Did the person act out of desperation? Was anyone physically harmed? The list goes on. To say that virtually no punishment could be unconstitutionally severe for all robbery convictions across all factual scenarios is absurd.

Justices Samour and Gabriel, at least, have started to push back. They argued that “easier and faster isn’t always better,” and that such “superficial proportionality review” is inappropriate when constitutional rights are at stake. Ultimately, they found “the drawbacks of per se designations far outweigh any purported benefits.”

Of course, Samour and Gabriel are right, but I’d add another critique: This constitutional “shortcut” makes absolutely no sense. Recall what it is ostensibly a shortcut to: comparing the gravity and/or seriousness of a criminal offense (including, per Colorado case law, characteristics of the offender) with the severity of the punishment imposed for it. In this context, neither “grave” nor “serious” is a bright-line, binary category. They exist along a spectrum. There is no being “not serious” up to a point before falling over a line into “seriousness.” This isn’t bankruptcy. This is a test about whether certain prison terms are too severe; one would think or at least hope that the Colorado Supreme Court is not perfectly fine with incarceration for wholly unserious crimes. To say that an offense is automatically “serious” or “grave,” therefore, means absolutely nothing, and it certainly doesn’t help understand if the resulting criminal punishment is fair.

What the court must mean, then, is that some crimes are sufficiently serious, but that only makes sense relative to the punishment imposed—a fact irrelevant to the court’s per se designation.

Perhaps I am thinking too hard about this. Such an arbitrary, court-created rule—born out of some combination of cowardly deference to extreme punishments and sheer laziness, and that even prosecutors agree is “a weird concept anyway”—doesn’t deserve that much credit. The point is: The Colorado Supreme Court’s rule, it turns out, is less a shortcut and more a barrier to protecting fundamental constitutional rights that should be torn down.

Only days remain until Zohran Mamdani ascends the throne of New York City, and nearly all his great opponents have given up. Andrew Cuomo, vanquished. Financier Bill Ackman, reduced to congratulations for the mayor-elect and even offers of support. Donald Trump, singing his praises after inviting him over to hang. Maybe the great socialist boogeyman isn’t so scary after all.

But not everyone is in the mood for total defeat. In a recent interview with Fox News, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman in Long Island announced a novel approach to combat the threat of socialism bearing down from America’s largest city: He is building a wall.

Mamdani, he said, “talks like he’s pro-criminal, not pro-victim.” And as such, in a last-ditch effort, Blakeman is going up with a wall on the border of Queens and Nassau counties, where New York City ends and what most think of as Long Island begins.

This makes plenty of sense. All truly great civilizations have a signature wall. China, for example. Also Donald Trump’s America. So why not Long Island? And this is not some archaic cinderblock and mortar contraption: It’s a top-of-the-line, high-tech fabrication.

“We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras,” Blakeman said in late November. “Nassau Exec Bruce Blakeman plans a wall of surveillance at NYC border after Mamdani win,” boasted the New York Post. So maybe not a Great Wall of China exactly, but certainly a wall with Chinese characteristics, given that an estimated 90 percent of surveillance cameras are made in China.

I appreciate the great works. But my request for a tour of the construction site was shot down; the county exec’s office gave me the elliptical redirect to watch Fox News. No one could tell me whether the wall was up or not. And the clock was ticking. So I headed for the borderlands, to watch the county batten down the hatches for the impending arrival of pro-criminal socialism, or else to delight in the last few days of open borders, Long Island–style.

I spoke with numerous sources in Long Island politics to pin down just where this wall might begin. The Queens–Nassau border is no small tract. To make matters worse, the border is effectively a stretch of highway, the Cross Island Parkway.

I began my tour at Bellerose Terrace, which I was told might be singled out as high priority. I got off at Jericho Turnpike. No surveillance wall in sight.

I stopped by the Bellerose Village Hall and asked for directions to the wall. A very kind woman working behind the desk straightened me out: I was being too literal.

“I think they’re talking about cameras,” she told me. But even so, she couldn’t point me to any new ones. “We haven’t seen any of that yet. They didn’t tell the village anything.”

The wall would be a crowning achievement of Blakeman’s tenure as county executive in Nassau. He has, in some sense, made Long Island into one of the world’s policing laboratories. In August, the county unveiled a $70 million police training village, replete with New York City–style homes, a church, a courtroom, a bar, and even a Long Island Rail Road–style station, where police run around doing what look a lot like combat exercises. Blakeman has also chartered a militia, hiring and deputized armed citizens for mobilization during emergency declarations. And now the wall.

Some would say that astronomical financial commitments to policing have gotten results. A 2024 U.S. News and World Report study found that Nassau County was one of the safest counties in America. Others would say that that same survey also found that the rest of the New York metropolitan area—aka crime-infested hellscape teeming with socialist policies—was similarly safe. Ten of the top 25 safest counties in the country were in New York metro, including Queens County and Brooklyn. The next year Blakeman announced even more police hires, and no more tax hikes to pay for them.

I got back on the Cross Island Parkway and headed for Elmont. This was another town, I was told, that had been identified for wall construction.

I saw a Nassau County Police Department squad car and talked to the officer inside. “That is coming from way more higher up than me,” he told me, of the wall implementation. He, too, was at a loss as to where I could identify some of these new cameras. “I mean, they could be up in any of the towers,” he said. Street lights and telephone poles and electrical wires were all fair game.

This abstracted wall, hung high in civilian infrastructure and currently invisible, couldn’t come at a more important time. With Elise Stefanik summarily bounced from the New York gubernatorial race after a swift falling out with Republican national political leadership, Blakeman is now likely to be the Republican standard bearer, in a race Republicans continue to tell themselves they can actually win because of the unpopularity of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, the fantastic ineptitude of the New York Democratic Party, and some anti-socialist backlash to the Mamdani ascendance. Republicans love to point out Blakeman won his most recent race by close to 12 percentage points in a county with over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. Trump has already endorsed him.

The result of Blakeman’s police push is that, obviously, the police budget is gargantuan. The 2025 budget of $4.2 billion doesn’t raise property taxes for the fourth year in a row, even though it adds over 50 new cops; over $1 billion of that is going to the police. He has boasted that he has hired 600 law enforcement officers and vetoed over $150 million in tax hikes, which would seem to spell financial trouble in the long run.

When asked how he would foot the bill for it all, Blakeman told Fox News it would come from civil asset forfeitures, an extremely controversial practice that allows law enforcement to seize property—including cash, cars, and assets like homes—from people merely suspected of being linked to crime, even without being charged or convicted. Some might say that they were going to pay for the wall by stealing from people in New York City.

I drove down to Valley Stream. Same story, no construction cones, no earth-moving, no camera crews. I stopped by another Nassau County Police Department office, where they instructed me to call the public affairs contact, who told me not only that he didn’t think they’d even started yet, but that he wasn’t “even sure they’re even gonna be allowed to do that.”

So maybe it was open borders after all. What else was there to do? I got back on the Cross Island Parkway, drove it north and south, crossed freely into Nassau and back into Queens. I counted preexisting security cameras as I went: three on a large gray tower on the west side of the parkway. One on decommissioned road work sign. One on a streetlight near the off-ramp. One more on another gray tower. Did I commit crimes all the way? Wouldn’t you like to know.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus is another entry in our occasional “Dear (Juris)Prudence” series, in which we invite listeners to ask their burning questions about the law and answer them as best we can. Write to amicus@slate.com to pose a question to Dahlia and Mark. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

What do we do about the Supreme Court? Several Supreme Court decisions over the past decade under John “ball-and-strikes” Roberts have not just reinterpreted laws but have effectively rewritten the Constitution such that many Democratic priorities are now effectively unconstitutional (gun control, campaign finance regulations, civil rights). Even a trifecta with a filibuster-proof majority cannot pass laws to address these issues. If you were put in charge of writing the Democrats’ Project 2029 Supreme Court chapter, what recommendations would you give to undo the damage this court has done that goes beyond waiting for the Grim Reaper?

Mark Joseph Stern: I’ve already laid out the blitz of executive actions that the next Democratic president needs to undertake immediately to undo the damage of Trumpism. But this question points toward an uncomfortable reality: To survive and endure, the next administration’s agenda must be accompanied by a suite of structural reforms that will, over time, make the Supreme Court more reflective of popular will. Congress absolutely needs to add states to the union, starting with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. That will ensure that rural red states like Wyoming and South Dakota are not so egregiously overrepresented. Remember, the senators who voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court represented fewer people than the senators who voted to oppose him. That is a huge structural problem that Congress can fix.

Now, any structural reforms that Congress enacts—including statehood for D.C.—need to include a provision stating that the Supreme Court cannot strike it down with a supermajority vote of 7–2. I am borrowing that idea from law professors Ryan D. Doerfler and Samuel Moyn. North Dakota and Nebraska actually have a version of this in their constitutions: Their state Supreme Courts can only strike down laws when a supermajority of justices finds them unconstitutional. I don’t think that’s such a bad idea. A supermajority requirement to invalidate legislation should be stuffed into everything Democrats do from here on out. Not just D.C. statehood, but campaign finance reform, gun safety laws, environmental regulations, civil rights. Put it in there that the law cannot be struck down unless seven justices agree that it’s unconstitutional.

I would also add a timing element, because this is one of the most insidious ways that the Supreme Court manipulates its docket. Think back to the Affordable Care Act: By the time SCOTUS weighed in, Democrats had lost their majority in the House of Representatives, so they would not have been able to repair whatever damage the court inflicted. There needs to be a time limit for judicial review built into all of these bills, combined with stringent limitations on forum shopping so that Matthew Kacsmaryk cannot immediately block them indefinitely. All legislation should require that any challenge must be commenced within, say, 30 days of the law’s enactment. And that challenge must be heard by a three-judge district court randomly drawn from around the country. Every bill should create an expedited appeals process and say that the Supreme Court must decide on the law’s constitutionality within one calendar year of passage—at which point Congress’ composition would presumably be the same.

What happens if the Supreme Court refuses to comply with all of this? The logical next step is to expand the court. Of course, Democrats could always choose to start with that, but I don’t think the political will is there quite yet. It seems to me that the first step needs to be a good-faith effort by Democrats to recalibrate the balance of power by reestablishing Congress’ primacy and diminishing the Supreme Court’s untouchable supremacy. If SCOTUS won’t allow that, then it’s time to add four seats.

That’s when the liberal justices need to aggressively restore constitutional democracy by ruthlessly overturning all of the worst decisions of the Roberts court. You know what I’m talking about: Dobbs, Shelby County v. Holder, Rucho v. Common Cause, all the bad voting-rights rulings, the affirmative action decision. The current Republican justices have already shredded adherence to precedent. A future liberal majority should say no to unilateral disarmament and apply the same rules. That is how Democrats put the court back in its place: by undoing its attacks on democracy and restoring the constitutional settlement the Roberts court has spent years dismantling. I think it’s something Democrats should be talking about right now.

During his first year back in office, President Donald Trump amassed an unprecedented amount of power in pursuit of his far-reaching agenda. His quests to crush the Democratic Party’s electoral power, seize control over the economy, and deport millions of immigrants were all actively abetted by the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices. Time and again—often over the shadow docket, with no explanation—the 6–3 supermajority cleared the path for Trump’s aggressive executive overreach. Those who believed that SCOTUS might serve as a modest check on the administration’s abuses were proved wrong almost weekly, as the court’s far-right bloc delivered win after win to the president it had helped return to the White House. The justices’ rare rebuke to Trump on Tuesday over his deployment of the National Guard in Chicago illustrated just how far outside the law this president must go before a majority is willing to tell him no.

On this week’s year-end episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern ponder the two big questions posed by this alliance: Why did the Supreme Court conservative supermajority align with Trump, and what consequences might it face for its choices? A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A year ago, we were operating under the theory that three of the six conservative justices were not all in for MAGA and genuinely cared about democracy. That was a mistake. Instead, what we have seen is the so-called center go all in for Trump, doubling and tripling down on the idea that this administration is like every other administration and any judge who tries to thwart it is a woke liberal—including fistfuls of Trump judges who aren’t auditioning for the Supreme Court. And just as the Supreme Court went after DOJ officials during Jack Smith’s prosecution of Donald Trump, it’s now going after judges who stand in the president’s way, suggesting that they are anti-Trump zealots suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” while we the justices are normal and must put a stop to it.

Why? It’s hard to believe that they go to cocktail parties with only the furthest of the far-right donors. It’s hard to believe that they don’t occasionally read the Washington Post or the New York Times. So what is going on? And this is the real thing I think we haven’t grappled with, but I’m not sure people who are watching the court have yet satisfactorily explained it, at least to my ears. What possible benefit is there to being the stewards of the MAGA destruction of America?

Mark Joseph Stern: My top-line thesis—and I want you to dispute it, because I don’t know if it’s entirely right—is that these justices have fully cast their lot with Trump and Trumpism. And a big part of Trumpism is antidemocratic, ensuring that political minorities can entrench their own power through undemocratic institutions like the Senate, the Electoral College, and the judiciary, as well as through voter suppression and assaults on democracy. Trumpism seeks to perpetuate a system that privileges the elites, the wealthy, white people, Christians, non-LGBTQ+ people. And I fear that the Supreme Court is now intertwined with that perception of who deserves power and who can legitimately exercise power—which is Trump and his GOP and their supporters. So it fills the need to protect Trump’s entire project from the direct forces of actual democracy.

That’s why one of the big pieces of this puzzle is voting rights. The Supreme Court is currently on the brink of delivering another blow to the Voting Rights Act in Callais v. Louisiana. It has been green-lighting voter suppression for so long. Just this month it reinstated Texas’ racial gerrymander that benefits Republicans. Any conversation of this kind needs to start there, because what we are seeing is the court trying to accelerate and facilitate the Trump agenda—and, on the other side of it, trying to ensure that the people can no longer shake loose this regime or really do anything to stop it and reverse what it has done, because there’s only one true way. It’s originalism and Trumpism, which are increasingly the same thing. And anyone who contests that is wielding an illegitimate claim to power. That justifies taking away voting rights and equal representation and democracy and whatever is necessary to ensure that what the regime’s doing now can just keep going forever.

When I started doing these New Year’s shows, it really struck me that we get absolutely caught up in individual big-ticket cases that weigh toward Trump and the culture wars, without looking at all the cases in the aggregate. When you’re covering the court, it is very easy to think, in the moment: The only case that matters is tariffs. Or transgender athletes. Or birthright citizenship. And, to be sure, every one of those cases is a blockbuster. But if you look at the big themes this year, you’re exactly right: It’s the voting cases. There are a lot of voting cases on the docket. We’ve talked about Callais and Texas’ gerrymander. There’s also campaign finance, plus a major case about mail ballots that the court will hear this term.

I think we really need to see the trend line, which is: The Supreme Court now has six votes to do anything it wants. And it is constantly taking cases about how people vote, where people vote, how their votes are counted, how campaigns are financed. While the big-ticket cases with huge social justice and racial justice implications do matter, it’s the democracy cases that have the biggest impact. We’re barreling into the midterms, and the 2028 election after that. And the way for the Supreme Court to achieve all the big-ticket items it wants is to make sure that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have a permanent majority.

By the way, these democracy cases don’t always get treated as seriously in the public conversation. They can be arcane; explaining campaign finance is a two-bourbon job right now. These are abstractions, and they can get devalued in the discourse. But we have to reckon with the fact that if you are a six-justice supermajority and you want to make sure you can do all the stuff you want to do for the next 10 or 20 years, you need to ensure that nothing will stop you, not even an election.

I do want to add that the birthright citizenship case, while absolutely a social justice issue, is also a democracy case. It’s about who counts as an American. And if the Trump administration gets its way, it would radically reduce the number of people who have a constitutional claim to birthright citizenship and are therefore able to participate in basic aspects of civic life. And that’s a theme that sounds in a lot of these other cases: Who gets to be a full and equal American citizen, and who gets something more like skim-milk citizenship? You see it in democracy cases and civil rights cases alike: Straight white men get the highest form of American citizenship. They can’t stop winning, while everybody else is losing.

That really does lead me to this stakes question, because we ask all the time on this show: What are the stakes for women? For LGBTQ+ communities? For immigrants? But I want to ask the question: What are the stakes for the Supreme Court? Because it seems to me we don’t think nearly hard enough about what is on the line for those six MAGA justices if they don’t shrink democracy enough to change electoral outcomes.

I think they have reached a point of no return, and they are scared of what happens if the political winds switch direction. At least some of them must understand that they have failed to act as independent jurists. In the mind of a majority of Americans, they are a political body, and as I said, they have cast their lot with Trumpism. If they had spent the past year truly standing up to Trump from time to time, I don’t think they’d have as much to fear from Republicans losing political power. I doubt there would be as much Democratic appetite for Supreme Court reform, including term limits and court expansion.

The Republican-appointed justices could have played this smarter if their goal was to stave off Democratic backlash. Giving Trump just 25 percent more losses would have given a lot of people the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the court was more or less doing its job. Americans want to see one branch stand in the way of another when it looks like there is an abuse of power. At this point, though, the justices have gone too far down this road to turn around. And they should be worried, because there is a very real chance that the entire Trumpist project will fall apart. And they are now so intertwined with Trumpism that they might collapse with it. That’s why it is so important for them to weaponize these democracy cases. There may come a time when the only way they can maintain their grasp on power is to oppress the majority.

Over the past calendar year, the Supreme Court’s center has shifted to the right and then more to the right, and the justices’ decisions have time and again facilitated Trump’s agenda. But the Roberts majority is not simply focused on what the current president wants; it has its sights set on a larger project: voting. Suppressing and constraining and problematizing the core function of democratic rule.

In this episode, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern reflect on the significant developments at the Supreme Court over the past year with an eye toward the implications of the court’s decisions on democracy, voting rights, and the erosion of checks and balances. Looking back at the past year at One First Street, Dahlia and Mark trace the cases that reveal the court’s long game, with elections coming quickly, and discuss the forces for and against democracy being exerted within and without the high court. Then, they turn to the urgent matter of what you and I can do about it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT has found that local carrier Korea Telecom (KT) deployed thousands of badly secured femtocells, leading to an attack that enabled micropayments fraud and snooping on customers’ communications – maybe for years.

Femtocells are customer premises equipment which include a small mobile base station and use a wired broadband service for backhaul into a carrier’s network. Carriers typically deploy them in areas where mobile network signals are weak to improve coverage in and around customers’ homes.

KT deployed thousands of the devices, all of which used the same certificate to authenticate to the carrier’s network. According to analysis by Korean infosec academic and IEEE Fellow Yongdae Kim, the femtocells had no root password, stored keys in plaintext, and were remotely accessible because SSH was enabled.

Attackers could therefore waltz in and retrieve the certificate, then use it to clone a femtocell that KT would treat as a legitimate device and happily connect to its network. And because the cert was set to expire after ten years, miscreants who understood these vulnerabilities had a long period in which to clone a femtocell and use it for evil. The Ministry’s report suggests attackers used one fake femtocell for ten months across 2024 and 2025.

The report also found that KT customers’ devices would automatically connect to a cloned femtocell, and that attackers could read those customers’ text messages and learn what numbers they called.

Korea Telecom operates a micropayments service that allows its customers to pay for digital content using SMS messages. In September, the carrier investigated some of its customers’ bills and detected the use of cloned femtocells in transactions valued at $169,000.

The Ministry’s report says 368 customers fell victim to the micropayment scam.

Yongdae Kim wrote that the $169,000 haul “is absurdly small for this infrastructure sophistication.”

“Rational inference: large-scale data collection was primary. Someone&#39;s greed exposed it. Without micropayment fraud, undetectable,” he added, suggesting that miscreants running cloned femtocells may have used their ability to access customers’ phones for surveillance.

That theory appears plausible for two reasons. One is that KT only has data on payments dating back to July 2024. The Ministry’s report therefore states it is not a definitive account of femtocell-related problems.

The other is that Korean police today published the results of their investigation into the matter, which turned up one fake femtocell that used a key installed in a device used on a Korean military base in 2019, and which went missing in 2020.

The police investigation found multiple cloned femtocells, plus evidence of a large gang running them. Police arrested 13 alleged participants and haven’t ruled out that the gang got some of the information it needed to run its ops from a previous attack on Korea Telecom that saw BPFDoor malware leak info from the carrier for three years starting in 2022. The investigation also alleges the perps went “war-driving” while running an illegal femtocell, to find more phones they could access. One of the arrested men tried to use a fake femtocell at Incheon Airport, on the same day someone else tried to export the cracked hardware to China.

The alleged mastermind of the gang remains at large but is the subject of an Interpol Red Notice.

South Korea’s government has reacted by insisting that KT let customers quit their contracts without penalty.

South Korea is currently a hotspot for bad security. Local e-tailer Coupang, and SK Telecom , are both in trouble for leaking millions of customer records. The nation has also endured a massive camera hijacking operation that grossly invaded some citizens’ privacy, and faces constant attacks and provocation from North Korea. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UPDATED Meta will acquire made-in-China AI outfit Manus and harness its “general agent” technology across its products.

Manus debuted in March 2025 and immediately pitched itself as a leap beyond generative AI chatbots, which it characterizes as best suited to summarizing information and answering questions.

The outfit promotes its own services as enabling “wide research and context-aware reasoning to produce actionable results in the format you need.”

To illustrate that promise, Manus offers a scenario in which users ask its tech to select the best candidate for an job by evaluating job applications stored in a .ZIP file. Manus can open that archive, read the files it contains, evaluate them according to user-defined criteria, then produce a document that ranks candidates by suitability for the role.

The service does that in its own “computer” – a cloud-hosted VM – that Manus says “operates as a multi-agent system powered by several distinct models.”

Manus was created by a Chinese company called Butterfly Effect, which also operates an entity in Hong Kong an recently moved its headquarters to Singapore. The outfit recently claimed to have $100 million annual recurring revenue just eight months after launch.

Meta’s announcement of the deal states: “Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide” and reveals the made-in-China company’s staff will join the social networking giant. The value of the deal was not disclosed.

Manus hailed its acquisition as “validation of our pioneering work with General AI Agents.”

“Our solution is driving value for millions of users worldwide today. With time, we hope to expand this subscription to the millions of businesses and billions of people on Meta’s platforms,” Manus’s post states, before adding a canned quote from CEO Xiao Hong who said joining the Zuckosphere represents a chance to “build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made.”

“We’re excited about what the future holds with Meta and Manus working together and we will continue to iterate the product and serve users that have defined Manus from the beginning.”

Meta boss-for-life Mark Zuckerberg wants to build a “superintelligence” service, which he defines as software “that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.”

In pursuit of that goal, Meta has committed to at least $70 billion of capital expenditure in 2025 and expects to spend more next year, much of it going towards building datacenters to host AI workloads. While the company credits AI with helping it to improve advertising revenue, Meta does not currently offer a paid AI service but is reportedly testing a subscription product called “Meta AI+”.

Manus seems a good fit for that offering, and perhaps also a step towards superintelligence.

The deal is the fifth AI-related acquisition Meta has made in 2025, following its purchases of AI startups PlayAI and WaveForms, accelerator developer Rivos, and wearable device developer Limitless. The social networking giant has also dangled eight-figure compensation packages to lure top AI talent to the company. ®

to note a report from Nikkei in which Meta said Manus will sever ties to Chinese investors and will not operate in China.

            <h2>Nvidia spends $5B on Intel bailout, instantly gets $2.5B richer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/29/nvidia_intel_5_billion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia’s $5 billion Intel stock purchase is already worth $7.58 billion, turning the recently approved bailout of its rival into a shrewd financial play.

Nvidia had locked in a purchase price of $23.28 per share for Intel when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan struck a deal in September.

The deal had been under scrutiny by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which was examining whether Nvidia’s potential 4 percent ownership stake could run afoul of antitrust laws.

However, the FTC gave the deal a greenlight on Dec. 18.

The purchase of 214 million shares closed on Dec. 26, according to Intel regulatory filings. Intel shares closed Monday at $36.68.

Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia and Intel will jointly develop “multiple generations” of chips for datacenter and PC in a move to capture share across the entire chip customer base from consumer to hyperscale customers.

The two companies will work on connecting their chips via the incredibly fast NVLink, which reaches 1.8 TB/s of bandwidth (900 GB/s in each direction) per GPU – about 14x the bandwidth of a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot.

In the PC arena, Intel will build Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.

Intel will also be able to build x86 systems-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX chips will power PCs that contain integrated CPUs and GPUs.

The agreement between Intel and Nvidia to develop chips for the data center and for the PC is similar to one that ran afoul of regulators in 2021 when Nvidia attempted to buy UK-based chipmaker Arm outright for $40 billion.

At the time, the FTC said such a deal would have given a large chipmaker control over one of its rivals and amounted to the largest semiconductor deal ever attempted.

The FTC sued. Nvidia abandoned the deal two months after the lawsuit was filed. Then FTC chairman Lina Khan noted it was a rare out-of-court win for the agency during US Senate testimony.

“The proposed merger would have given one of the largest chip companies control over its rivals’ designs for competing chips,” she told United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights in September 2022. “By doing so, the FTC’s complaint alleged that the combined firm would have had the means and incentive to stifle next-generation technologies, including those used to run datacenters and driver-assistance systems in cars.”

Khan, an appointee of former US President Joe Biden, is no longer with the agency. Nvidia has a long-standing relationship with both Arm and Arm-based SoC designers. Prior to its 72-core Grace CPUs, Nvidia worked with Arm on its Tegra family of chips, which power consoles like Nintendo Switch. And as we previously reported, Nvidia has extended similar support for its NVLink tech to Qualcomm and Fujitsu. ®

            <div id="article-text">Rogue insiders suspected of taking bribes to hand over Coinbase customer records to criminals are beginning to face justice, according to CEO Brian Armstrong.

The Coinbase chief said on X the day after Christmas that Hyderabad police had arrested an ex-Coinbase customer service agent, and that the apprehensions weren&#39;t going to stop there.

&quot;Another one down and more still to come,&quot; Armstrong said.

The arrest follows a May disclosure by Coinbase that &quot;a group of rogue overseas support agents&quot; working for the US-based cryptocurrency exchange had allegedly taken bribes from cybercriminals in exchange for nearly 70,000 customer records.

According to Coinbase, the December 2024 incident involved the theft of names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, images of government IDs, account data, masked SSNs and bank account information, and &quot;limited corporate data.&quot; Despite the extensive theft of personally identifying information, no 2FA codes, private keys, or access to wallets were obtained as part of the breach.

Nonetheless, the criminals behind the theft reportedly used the stolen information to trick some Coinbase users into handing over cryptocurrency while posing as Coinbase employees, as well as trying to use the incident to extort the company for $20 million.

&quot;Instead of paying the $20 million ransom, we&#39;re establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attackers,&quot; Coinbase said in May. It&#39;s not clear if the arrest has coincided with any bounty payout; we reached out to Coinbase with questions for this story but didn&#39;t get a direct response to any of our questions.

X users met Armstrong&#39;s post about the arrest in India with considerable criticism, accusing the company of opening its customers up to the bribery of customer service representatives and exfiltration of its data by outsourcing its customer service to India instead of relying on US-based agents to support its users.

Coinbase has been accused of having poor customer service in the past, with CNBC reporting in 2021 that account takeover attacks on the platform were rampant, and that the company allegedly left customers hanging when they asked for the outfit to help restore access to their accounts or claw back their stolen digital cash.

While Coinbase didn&#39;t touch on our questions about the state of its customer service or the bounty fund, a spokesperson did tell us that it was busily chasing down fraudsters bilking its customers out of cash.

According to a December 19 blog post, Coinbase said it worked with the Brooklyn District Attorney&#39;s Office to support the investigation and charging of a Brooklyn man accused of impersonating a Coinbase representative and stealing nearly $16 million from about 100 users nationwide.

The Brooklyn DA alleges that 23-year-old Ronald Spektor had engaged in a long-running social engineering scam tricking Coinbase users into believing their accounts were at risk from being compromised, posing as a Coinbase customer service rep, and convincing them to hand over their crypto coins, which were transferred to a wallet under Spektor&#39;s control.

More than $600,000 of the suspect&#39;s alleged proceeds have been recovered by law enforcement so far, Coinbase said earlier this month.

Coinbase told The Register during a phone conversation on Monday that, despite the seeming similarity between Spektor&#39;s charges and the overseas customer service bribery theft, the two aren&#39;t related. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A criminal group is beating Conde Nast over the head for not responding sooner to its extortion attempt by posting stolen subscribers&#39; email and home addresses and warning the publisher of Wired, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Teen Vogue that it has 40 million more entries.

The group known as Lovely said that it tried to tell Conde Nast about the holes in its security a month ago, but after not receiving a response, they decided to publish the email addresses of subscribers on Christmas Day.

The current leak is centered around readers of Wired magazine. The miscreants published 2.3 million emails, which had the names of 285,000 subscribers, 108,000 home addresses, and 32,000 phone numbers.

Additionally, some user IDs, display names, account creation and update timestamps, and in some cases last session dates and IP addresses, have been published, which shows the database that was targeted could have contained live data and was not a static marketing repository.

“Conde Nast does not care about the security of their users’ data. It took us an entire month to convince them to fix the vulnerabilities (on) their website,” the hackers wrote in a forum post. “We will leak more of their users’ data (40+ million) over the next few weeks. Enjoy!”

The batch of files was published to Limewire and Gofile.io.

The world could soon learn if you subscribed to The New Yorker, from which they could infer whether you are the kind of person who appreciates their dry, witty cartoons that take poignant stabs at life in the modern age. The Register has reached out to Conde Nast for comment, but has not yet received a reply.

Security researchers who downloaded the tranche of files determined that the hackers were not bluffing. The email addresses which were released appear to match subscribers whose emails have been compromised. Researchers with Hudson Rock said the attack bears the hallmarks of techniques used by infostealer malwares such as RedLine and Racoon.

“Our researchers identified legitimate subscriber credentials for wired.com within global infostealer infection logs. By matching these compromised credentials against the records in the leaked database, we have definitively confirmed the authenticity of the dataset without any interaction with the victim organization,” Hudson Rock wrote on its website.

Its researchers warn that victims could be subject to doxxing, swatting and phishing campaigns as a result of having their information published. However, Hackread pointed out that the silver lining appears to be no credit card information has been exposed. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How’d you like to earn more than half a million dollars working for one of the world’s fastest-growing tech companies? The catch: the job is stressful, and the last few people tasked with it didn’t stick around. Over the weekend, OpenAI boss Sam Altman went public with a search for a new Head of Preparedness, saying rapidly improving AI models are creating new risks that need closer oversight.

Altman flagged an opening for the company&#39;s Head of Preparedness on Saturday in a post on X. Describing the role, which carries a $555,000 base salary plus equity, as one focused on securing OpenAI&#39;s systems and understanding how they could be abused, Altman also noted that AI models are beginning to present &quot;some real challenges&quot; as they rapidly improve and gain new capabilities.

&quot;The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025,&quot; Altman said, without elaborating on specific cases or products.

AI has been flagged as an increasingly common trigger of psychological troubles in both juveniles and adults, with chatbots reportedly linked to multiple deaths in the past year. OpenAI, one of the most popular chatbot makers in the market, rolled back a GPT-4o update in April 2025 after acknowledging it had become overly sycophantic and could reinforce harmful or destabilizing user behavior.

Despite that, OpenAI released ChatGPT-5.1 last month, which included a number of emotional dependence-nurturing features, like the inclusion of emotionally-suggestive language, &quot;warmer, more intelligent&quot; responses, and the like. Sure, it might be less sycophantic, but it&#39;ll speak to you with more intimacy than ever before, making it feel more like a human companion instead of the impersonal, logical ship computer from Star Trek that spits facts with little regard for feeling.

It&#39;s no wonder the company needs someone to steer the ship with regard to model safety.

&quot;We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities,&quot; Altman said, &quot;but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused.&quot;

According to the job posting, the Head of Preparedness will be responsible for leading technical strategy and execution of OpenAI&#39;s preparedness framework [PDF], which the company describes as its approach &quot;to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.&quot;

It&#39;s not a new role, mind you, but it&#39;s one that&#39;s seen more turnover than the Defense Against Dark Arts faculty position at Hogwarts.

Aleksander Madry, director of MIT&#39;s Center for Deployable Machine Learning and faculty leader at the Institute&#39;s AI Policy Forum, occupied the Preparedness role until July 2024, when OpenAI reassigned him to a reasoning-focused research role.

This, mind you, came in the wake of a number of high-profile safety leadership exits at the company and a partial reset of OpenAI&#39;s safety team structure.

In Madry&#39;s place, OpenAI appointed Joaquin Quinonero Candela and Lilian Weng to lead the preparedness team. Both occupied other roles at OpenAI prior to heading up preparedness, but neither lasted long in the position. Weng left OpenAI in November 2024, while Candela left his role as head of preparedness in April for a three-month coding internship at OpenAI. While still an OpenAI employee, he&#39;s out of the technical space entirely and is now serving as head of recruiting.

&quot;This will be a stressful job and you&#39;ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,&quot; Altman said of the open position.

Understandably so - OpenAI and model safety have long had a contentious relationship, as numerous ex-employees have attested. One executive who left the company in October called the Altman outfit out for not being as focused on safety and the long-term effects of its AGI push as it should be, suggesting that the company was pushing ahead in its goal to dominate the industry at the expense of the rest of society.

Will $555,000 be enough to keep a new Preparedness chief in the role? Skepticism may be warranted.

OpenAI didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

LG expands its lifestyle category by adding the Gallery TV to display artwork in your living room.

In just the past couple years, the art TV category that’s been dominated by Samsung’s The Frame has seen growth, with additions from both TCL and Hisense. Now LG has announced its own entry, the LG Gallery TV. The TV will leverage the Gallery+ service that LG released earlier this year, which includes thousands of display visuals ranging from pieces of art to cinematic images to gaming scenes. Much like Samsung’s Art Store, Gallery+ has a limited free option, but its full capability requires a subscription.

The new Gallery TV shouldn’t be confused with the G Series OLED TVs, like the LG G5, even though the G Series used to be called the Gallery Series up until a couple years ago. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with “a specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience” (so it likely has a matte coating). LG hasn’t specified the backlight configuration, but all of the other art TVs use edge lighting, so it’s a safe bet that this one will as well. OLED technology, while offering superior picture quality to mini LED, isn’t able to display a single image for an extended time without concern of image retention (or burn-in).

LG has taken a cue from Hisense and includes a frame with the Gallery TV. The default frame is white, with the option to purchase an additional wood-colored frame. The TV will be available in 55 and 65 inches, but pricing has yet to be released.

The co-founder of GOG and CD Projekt has acquired the preservation-focused game marketplace.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

GOG is splitting from CD Projekt, the game company that launched the preservation-focused PC gaming marketplace in 2008. In an update on Monday, GOG announced that its co-founder, Michał Kiciński, has acquired the digital storefront and its online gaming platform GOG Galaxy from CD Projekt — which he also co-founded — for $25.2 million.

The acquisition isn’t changing anything about GOG’s mission to keep games DRM-free, according to the announcement that says it’s “more central to GOG than ever:”

GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.

This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.

It also won’t change GOG’s relationship with its former parent company, CD Projekt, which will keep selling existing games, like The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, along with upcoming titles, on the marketplace:

The SNES version of the USB cartridge slot can authenticate your carts and back up your games and save data.

After announcing and teasing its design well over a year ago, Epilogue’s new SN Operator will finally be available for preorder starting tomorrow. Like the company’s GB Operator that debuted in early 2021, the SN Operator is a standalone USB cartridge slot that lets you play and archive old Nintendo console games on PCs, Macs, or handhelds like the Steam Deck using their original carts. But where the GB Operator was built for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and GBA games, the SN Operator instead supports any Super Nintendo and Super Famicom game.

Preorders for the SN Operator will open at 12PM ET on December 30th for $59.99. That’s $10 more expensive than the smaller GB Operator, which will remain available too. The hardware is expected to ship in April 2026.

The cartridge slot connects to computers or handhelds over USB and works alongside Epilogue’s accompanying Playback app. The app features a built-in SNES emulator for playing your original cartridges, but you can use other emulators if you already have one you prefer. Games that relied on accessories like Nintendo’s Super NES Mouse or the Super Scope are also compatible with Playback and will use your computer mouse instead of those peripherals.

On top of new console support, the SN Operator includes another function that should appeal to retro gaming fans with large collections of aging and degrading cartridges. The Playback app can authenticate cartridges so you know for sure if that rare title you found at a flea market is real or a bootleg. It can also create digital copies of your cartridges including their save game data so you can archive your collection and keep on playing where you originally left off, even if your original cartridges stop working. The SN Operator will work with any cartridge that can be played in Nintendo’s original hardware, including bootlegs you accidentally purchased. But Epilogue does specify you should only back up cartridges you own — so no using this to borrow and copy a giant collection from a friend.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Most platforms give you some control over what appears in your recommendations and ‘for you’ feeds.

﻿Most platforms give you some control over what appears in your recommendations and ‘for you’ feeds.

Love them or hate them, more than half of the world’s population interacts with algorithmic recommendations in some way every day. Algorithmic recommendations play an integral role in how users discover new content across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. It can be nice to be fed a stream of fresh posts, pictures, and videos that are already tailored to our interests instead of manually hunting for content to engage with, but algorithms don’t always show you what you actually want to see.

Many online platforms provide features that aim to help you fix this. The algorithms they deploy are, after all, designed to make you spend more time consuming content and work in similar ways. Recommendations may be based on demographic data like age, sex, and location, your online activity, what you and similar users are interacting with, and more. Most algorithm tuning features follow the same basic premise: you tell the platform what you want to see more of, or less of.

For example, Meta’s in-development “Dear algo” feature for Threads takes that premise quite literally, allowing users to ask for “more” of specific type of content. Meanwhile, the recently launched “Your Algorithm” tool for Instagram lets users see and manage which topics are driving their Reels recommendations. Some content on online platforms may be artificially promoted regardless of whether it aligns with user interests, however. This article breaks down what algorithm tuning tools are provided by some of the most popular online platforms, and other solutions that can help you to — at least partially — reign in recommended content.

The posts that appear on your Facebook feed are a mix of recommended content and whatever is being published by friends and pages you follow. For the latter, you can just leave any page groups you’re no longer interested in and unfriend users to stop seeing their posts.

An easy way to do this is to go to Settings & privacy > Content preferences, and then open the “Unfollow people and groups” option to quickly manage your friends and group lists in one place. The Content preferences menu also lets you toggle off suggestions for political content and provides a “Show less” option for sensitive or graphic content.

There are other controls available under Settings & privacy > Settings > Your activity > Activity log that list other interactions you’ve had on the platform: comments, search history, videos watched, and more. Deleting these interaction histories (either individually or by clearing them entirely) may help to prevent Facebook’s algorithm from suggesting similar content in the future.

For specific posts, you can click into the three-dot menu at the top right of the post itself and select either “Interested” to see more of similar content, or “Not interested” to prompt Facebook into showing you less related content. Meta said it’s planning to “introduce new ways for you to shape your Feed” on Facebook in the coming months, including the ability to give feedback on why something in your feed may not be relevant to you.

For Reels specifically, Meta has a tool that allows you to manage which topics Instagram is using to feed recommended videos to your Reels tab. On the Instagram mobile app, you can tap the icon that resembles two hearts on line sliders at the top-right corner of Reels videos to see an AI-generated summary of topics that are based on your activity history, such as gaming, haircare, college football, or whatever else you’ve interacted with.

Tapping on any of these interests gives you the options to watch Reels on that topic, delete it from your interests, or specify to see less of it on your feed. You can also manually add new interests that you want to see more or less of that aren’t included in the AI summary. The Instagram app will also let you tap the three-dot menu on individual Reels to select “Interested” or “Not Interested,” but this feature isn’t available on the desktop Reels tab.

The main Instagram feed presents those Interested / Not Interested options on both mobile and desktop devices. And like Facebook, Instagram users can click into Settings to manage preferences for sensitive and political content and curate their activity history across likes, comments, reposts, tags, and more to remove anything that might be flagging certain interests to Instagram’s algorithm.

Threads allows you to tap on the three-dot menu on any post on the web and mobile app, and select “Not interested” to see less content around that topic. Unlike Facebook and Instagram, however, Threads won’t let you specify posts you want to see more of. There are also fewer options to manage recommended content if you head into the account settings on desktop devices — you can restrict profiles to see fewer posts from them, block profiles entirely, and mute specific words or phrases to prevent posts that contain them from appearing in your feeds.

The Threads mobile app will provide additional options under the settings menu at the top right of your user profile. From there, you can remove any likes you’ve left on posts, or select “Content preferences” to toggle suggestions for political and sensitive content, alongside muting accounts and filtering words.

Threads is also testing a feature called “Dear algo requests” that can be accessed under this menu, or by typing “Dear algo” in a post, and then describing what you want to see more or less often in your feeds for up to three days. I’m seeing this feature available on my own account in the UK, but the beta may not be available to every user yet.

There are two ways to tune your algorithm on X, and they can both be accessed the same way across web and mobile apps. The first is to tap the three-dot menu at the top right of a post on your “For You” feed, and select “Not interested in this post” to see less of any similar content. Note that this option won’t appear if you open the post itself, so make sure you’re accessing the menu from the feed timeline.

The second and more comprehensive option is to open Settings and privacy > Privacy and safety > Content you see. This view will let you toggle to display media containing sensitive content and see a full list of interests that X is using to “personalize your experience” across the platform. These will all feature a ticked checkbox, so just go through and untick anything you’re not actually interested in seeing, though X says that changes “may take a little while to go into effect.”

The “Content you see” menu also lets you mute accounts and keywords to keep them out of your feeds and manage topics you want to follow or see less of. Following topics will prompt X to show you more related content, while the topics on posts you’ve already flagged to see less of will appear under the “Not interested” tab.

TikTok provides similar algorithm tuning tools to X, including the ability to flag specific videos you’re not interested in. You can access this on the TikTok mobile app by long-pressing on the video or by opening the three-dot menu at the top right of videos on the desktop web platform. Web users can also open the settings menu to filter specific keywords, preventing posts that contain them in titles, descriptions, or stickers from appearing in your feeds.

Additional features can only be accessed on the TikTok mobile apps. On your user profile, open the three-line menu at the top right and select Settings and privacy > Content preferences. You can open the Manage topics option to see a list of preset interests like Dance, Humor, Sports, Food & Drink, and more, each with a slider to adjust if you want to see more or less of that topic on your feed. Content preferences also allow you to enable a “Restricted Mode” that limits content that “may not be comfortable for all audiences.”

For more drastic changes, TikTok has a feature that helps to retrain its algorithm to what video topics you enjoy watching. Selecting “Refresh your For You feed” under Content preferences will “temporarily show you popular videos you may not normally see,” according to TikTok, allowing it to learn what you like from scratch based on videos you like, share, and interact with.

YouTube’s algorithm tuning tools may require some patience because the platform doesn’t provide an overview of topics or interests you’re being targeted with. On the YouTube homepage, you can open the three-dot menu at the bottom right under each video on the web or mobile app and then select “Not interested” to see less of similar content, or “Don’t recommend channel” to keep the creator who posted it out of your feeds.

The same feature works slightly differently for Shorts — the “Not interested” and “Don’t recommend channel” options are both available on the YouTube mobile app’s Shorts tab and can be accessed by either long-pressing on a video or opening the three-dot menu at the top right. The Shorts tab on YouTube’s web platform only provides you with the option to block channel recommendations, however, and only allows you to tag Shorts you’re not interested in if those Shorts appear on YouTube’s homepage.

If you want to hide recommended videos entirely, you can delete and turn off your YouTube watch history on your connected Google account by going to My Activity > YouTube History.

There are a few ways to adjust what content will appear on your Reddit home feed. As we’ve seen with other platforms, you can open the three-dot menu at the top right of suggested posts and select “Show fewer posts like this.” You can also click on your user profile and open Settings > Preferences on the web, or Settings > Account settings on the Reddit mobile app to mute specific subreddit communities, filter out mature content, or toggle home feed recommendations off entirely.

If you keep it active, then Reddit will recommend posts based on your activity on the platform, including your search history and posts or communities you’ve interacted with.

It’s easy to direct what content you want to see in the preset Discover feed on Bluesky. Just open the three-dot menu at the bottom right on any post and — you guessed it — select if you want to see more or less of similar content. Alternatively, you can unpin the Discover feed entirely and replace it with a more curated feed that focuses on topics you’re interested in by selecting one of the options under the My feeds tab, identified by its hashtag symbol.

Like other platforms, the algorithm on Tumblr’s “For you” tab is largely prompted by how you interact with the platform itself and what’s popular with similar users in your communities. If you like art and follow a lot of artists, Tumblr will recommend art-related posts, and so forth.

For posts that aren’t from users or communities you follow, you can open the three-dot menu to tag that you’re not interested in the post itself, or the community it was shared in. You can also open Settings > Dashboard preferences to turn off suggestions that are “based on your likes” and posts from your communities in the following tab.

It’s almost the new year and time to treat yourself to a new pair of earbuds — especially if one of your resolutions for 2026 is to work out more. If you find yourself reading this and nodding, take a look at the Beats Powerbeats Fit, a recent upgrade of Beats’ Fit Pro earbuds that feature a redesigned wing tip. They are now on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H for about $179.99, which is $20 off their usual $199.99 price and the lowest they’ve gone so far.

According to the company, the new tips have more flexibility in order to improve comfort while keeping the earbuds more securely anchored in your ears. While these mid-level earbuds still use the H1 chips (the Powerbeats Pro 2 and the AirPods Pro 3 are equipped with Apple’s newer H2 wireless chip), they have most of the features you’d look for, whether you’re using them with an iPhone (hands-free Siri access, Find My tracking, and syncing across Apple devices through iCloud) or an Android phone (one-touch pairing and location tracking through the Beats mobile app, along with customizable controls).

A new version of the Fit Pro wireless earbuds, which are upgraded with a redesigned wing tip that Beats says is 20 percent more flexible, a smaller case, and other advantages.

In addition, they offer active noise cancellation, an IPX4 rating, and seven hours of playback (six hours with ANC turned on). Read our coverage.

The depth-defying lens can focus on multiple objects at different distances.

A camera lens, historically, can only focus on one thing at a time, just like the human eye. That could be a thing of the past, though, thanks to a breakthrough lens technology developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that can bring every part of a scene into sharp focus, capturing finer details across the entire image, no matter the distance.

Traditional lenses are limited to sharpening one focal plane (the distance between an object and your camera) at a time, blurring everything behind or in front of that object. That effect can bring a sense of depth to images, but seeing a full picture clearly typically requires you to combine multiple photographs that were shot at different focal lengths. This new “spatially-varying autofocus” system instead combines a mix of technologies that “let the camera decide which parts of the image should be sharp — essentially giving each pixel its own tiny, adjustable lens,” according to CMU associate professor Matthew O’Tool.

The researchers developed a “computational lens” that combines a Lohmann lens — two curved, cubic lenses that shift against each other to tune focus — with a phase-only spatial light modulator — a device that controls how light bends at each pixel — allowing the system to focus at different depths simultaneously. It also uses two autofocus methods: Contrast-Detection Autofocus (CDAF), which divides images into regions that independently maximize sharpness, and Phase-Detection Autofocus (PDAF), which detects whether something is in focus and which focal direction to adjust.

The experimental system “could fundamentally change how cameras see the world,” according to CMU professor Aswin Sankaranarayanan.

It isn’t available in any commercial camera you can actually buy, and it may be some time before options start appearing on the market, if ever. CMU researchers suggest that this tech could have broader applications beyond traditional photography, however, including improved efficiency in microscopes, creating lifelike depth perception for VR headsets, and helping autonomous vehicles to see their surroundings with “unprecedented clarity.”

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-25</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1129294/ronald-deibert-citizen-lab-digital-threats-spies-cybersecurity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <h2>Four bright spots in climate news in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
