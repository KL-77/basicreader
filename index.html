            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a new presidential administration comes in, it is responsible for filling around 4,000 jobs sprinkled across the federal government’s vast bureaucracy. These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials.

Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals & metals industry & analysis, are more obscure.

Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.

Since the early 2000s, according to federal employment records, NIH, the country’s premier biomedical research agency, has usually had just a few political appointees within its workforce. (As of November 2025, that workforce numbered around 17,500 people, after significant cuts.) Staff scientists and external experts played a key role in selecting the directors of the 27 institutes and centers that make up NIH. That left the selection of people for powerful positions largely outside of direct White House oversight.

What is the future of that status quo under the Trump administration?

Those questions have recently swirled at NIH. The arrival of political appointees in the kinds of positions previously held by civil servants, and apparent changes to hiring practices for other key positions, have raised concerns among current and former officials about a new era of politicization.

For decades, NIH has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. But conservative lawmakers have periodically raised questions about some of the agency’s spending, and according to one 2014 survey, the agency is perceived by federal executives as being a progressive place. (Since the early 2000s, some data suggests, US scientists as a whole have grown considerably more liberal relative to the general population.)

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many conservatives have criticized NIH for funding the kind of controversial virology experiments that some experts believe may have started the pandemic, and for promoting public health strategies that many on the right viewed as unscientific and authoritarian. One of the NIH institute directors, Anthony Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 until his retirement in 2022, came to be a highly polarizing figure, described on the right as an unelected official wielding considerable power.

Over the years, some biomedical researchers have argued for changes to the way NIH hires and retains people in leadership positions. In 2019, the agency announced plans to impose term limits on some midlevel roles, in a bid to diversify its management. More recently, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Joseph Marine argued in an essay for The Free Press that NIH should set five to 10-year term limits on the directors of individual NIH institutes. “Regular turnover of leadership,” he wrote, “brings fresh ideas and a healthy reassessment of priorities.”

Shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump tapped Jay Bhattacharya, a prominent critic of NIH, to lead the agency. It may not be entirely surprising that an administration advocating for reforms to NIH would seek to flip key management positions that often experience little turnover.

Former official Mike Lauer, who until early 2025 oversaw NIH’s vast external grants program, said there were signs before Trump’s second inauguration that institute directors might be subject to fresh political scrutiny.

“There was a frustration that so much of the agency’s direction, as well as financial decision-making, was being made by people who are outside of the political sphere,” Lauer told Undark. He pointed to a line in Project 2025, a proposed roadmap for the Trump administration that was produced by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “Funding for scientific research,” the report argues, “should not be controlled by a small group of highly paid and unaccountable insiders at the NIH, many of whom stay in power for decades.”

Soon after Trump’s inauguration, some senior officials at NIH were put on administrative leave or abruptly departed, including Lawrence Tabak, who had spent more than a decade as principal deputy director and served as NIH’s interim leader for almost two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the same time, the administration grew the number of political appointees at NIH. As of late June, according to federal records, the Trump administration had placed nine political appointees at the agency, up from four the year before—itself higher than in most previous years. One of them, Seana Cranston, is a former Republican Congressional staffer who serves as chief of staff to the NIH Director; her predecessor was a career civil servant who had spent nearly 40 years in the NIH, the last four as chief of staff. Another is Michael Allen, who took the role of chief operating officer for the $6.5 billion NIAID, Fauci’s former institute. (Allen was appointed with no official announcement, and appears to have no official biography or background information posted on NIH websites.)

Those numbers still left NIH with fewer political appointees than many other agencies, including NASA, a comparably sized science agency.

The administration has departed from the traditional process for hiring NIH’s 27 institute and center directors, who are responsible for overseeing most of the funding decisions and day-to-day operations of NIH.

In the spring of 2025, five of those directors—including the head of NIAID—were fired or placed on administrative leave. (They have all since been removed from their positions.)

Then, in September, part of the search committee for the National Institute of Mental Health was abruptly disbanded, and then just as suddenly reconvened, according to Joshua Gordon, the former head of that institute, and one other source close to NIH.

In October, the directorship of another agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, was filled by a close personal friend of Vice President JD Vance, without any apparent search process — a move that multiple former NIH officials told Undark may be unprecedented.

By then, 13 other NIH institutes and centers had vacant leadership posts. Other roles have opened up more recently: In an email to NIH staff on Dec. 30, Bhattacharya announced the departure of Walter Koroshetz, leader of the agency’s main neuroscience research institute. In the email, Bhattacharya seemed to suggest he had opposed the decision: “Dr. Koroshetz’s performance as Director has been exceptional,” Bhattacharya wrote, but “the Department of Health and Human Services has elected to pursue a leadership transition.”

In early January, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute announced his retirement, bringing the total number of open posts to 15.

The searches, NIH insiders say, appear to be happening on a compressed timeline. And while the NIH director has typically relied on search committees consisting of both NIH career scientists and external experts, multiple sources close to NIH say the agency has not formed those kinds of committees to make the latest round of hires.

In response to questions from Undark in early January, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a brief emailed statement, signed “NIH Press Team,” explaining that “an NIH leadership team with experience in scientific agency management will consider the applicant pool and make recommendations to the NIH Director.” The press representative declined to respond to follow-up questions about who would be on that team, or why the hiring process had changed.

Those changes have prompted speculation among some NIH insiders that the Trump administration is seeking to exert more political control over the hiring of directorships.

“Having external members on the search committee is vitally important for preventing politicization,” said Mark Histed, an NIH scientist who has recently been a critic — on his personal time, he stresses — of Trump’s approach to the agency. “Because, as you can imagine, if you’ve got a bunch of external scientists, it’s a lot harder to ram down what the White House wants, because people are not part of the political system.”

That kind of open and non-politicized search process, Histed said in a follow-up interview, isn’t unique to NIH: It’s one widely used by scientific institutions around the world. And it has worked, he argued, to help make NIH a scientific juggernaut: “That process,” he said, “led to 80 years of staggering scientific success.”

Members of Congress have taken notice. In language attached to the current appropriations bill moving through Congress, lawmakers direct NIH “to maintain its longstanding practice of including external scientists and stakeholders” in the search process. (Agencies are supposed to follow these Congressional instructions, but they are not binding.) In late January, Diana DeGette, a Democratic representative from Colorado, sponsored a bill that, according to a press release, would “Protect NIH From Political Interference” by, among other steps, capping the number of political appointees at the agency.

Lauer, the former NIH grants chief, took a broader historical view of the changes. There has long been a tug-of-war, he said, between presidential administrations that seek more political control over an agency, and civil servants and other bureaucratic experts who may resist that perceived incursion. From the point of view of politicians and their staff, Lauer said, “what they’ll say—I understand where they’re coming from—what they’ll say is, is that more political control means that the agency is going to be responsive to the will of the electorate, that there’s a greater degree of transparency and public accountability.”

Those upsides can be significant, Lauer said, but there are also downsides, including more short-term thinking, unstable budgets, and the potential loss of expertise and competence.

Mark Richardson, a political scientist at Georgetown University, is an expert on politicization and the federal bureaucracy. In his work, he said, he has observed a correlation between how much political parties disagree over the role of a specific agency, and the degree to which presidential administrations seek to exert control there through appointees and other personnel choices. NIH has historically fallen alongside agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that are subject to broad alignment across the parties.

“I think what you’re seeing more with the Trump administration is kind of an expansion of political conflict to these types of agencies,” Richardson said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exterminators keep getting calls for a reason. Wood-devouring insects, such as beetles, termites, and carpenter ants, are constantly chewing through walls or infecting trees and breaking them down. The fight against these insects usually involved noxious insecticides; but now, at least some of them can be eliminated using a certain species of fungus.

Infestations of bark beetles are the bane of spruce trees. Eurasian spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) ingest bark high in phenolic compounds, organic molecules that often act as antioxidants and antimicrobials. They protect spruce bark from pathogenic fungi—and the beetles take advantage. Their bodies boost the antimicrobial power of these compounds by turning them into substances that are even more toxic to fungi. This would seem to make the beetles invulnerable to fungi.

There is a way to get past the beetles’ borrowed defenses, though. Led by biochemist Ruo Sun, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, found that some strains of the fungus Beauveria bassiana are capable of infecting and killing the pests.

“Insect herbivores have long been known to accumulate plant defense metabolites from their diet as defenses against their own enemies,” she said in a study recently published in PNAS. “However, as shown here for B. bassiana, fungal pathogens are able to circumvent the toxicity of these dietary defenses and cause disease.”

Populations of bark beetles have recently exploded in temperate forests because of climate change. One species they feed on is the Norway spruce (Picea abies), which makes organic phenolic compounds known as stilbenes and flavonoids. Stilbenes are hydrocarbons that function as secondary metabolites for plants, and flavonoids, which are polyphenols, are also secondary plant metabolites that are often antioxidants. The spruce links both classes of compounds with sugars and relies on their antibacterial and antifungal activity.

When metabolized by the beetles, the spruce sugars are removed through hydrolysis, converting them into aglycones that are even more toxic to microscopic invaders. Despite that, some fungi appear to be able to deactivate these compounds. Strains of the fungal insect pathogen B. bassiana have been documented as killing some of these beetles in the wild.

Sun wanted to put this fungus to the test. While not all strains have been effective at eliminating bark beetles, she and her team extracted the fungus from beetles that had succumbed to it. They bred these strains in their lab to see how effective they would be against the insects. They identified the genes that gave these fungi their ability to metabolize phenolic compounds ingested by the beetles and detoxify them so they were no longer protective. They then experimented with knocking out these genes to see whether the mutant fungi would still be able to take down beetles.

Once beetles were infected with B. bassiana, the researchers found the fungus detoxifies protective compounds in two phases. The aglycones that were made so potent by the removal of sugars from spruce stilbenes and flavanoids are made weaker by having the sugar restored in the first phase. Methylation happens next. After this phase, the sugar is linked to a methyl group (CH3), forming a type of methylglucoside. This particular methylglucoside is harmless to the fungus. Mutant strains of the fungus that had their detoxification genes knocked out could not produce methylglucoside, so they were not as effective at infecting beetles and were nowhere near as lethal.

B. bassiana is not the only fungus that is capable of this detox. Other species, including the infamous Cordyceps militaris that terrorized a dystopian society in The Last of Us (though it will not turn people into fungus monsters), are capable of producing methylglucosides from stilbenes, flavonoids, and other compounds that are supposed to protect plants from infection and are borrowed by the insects that gorge on them.

“Besides direct detoxification, fungi such as B. bassiana could have other mechanisms of resisting plant defense compounds,” Sun said. “[Some] are known to excrete compounds like resveratrol from fungal cells, and so could also play a role in increasing fungal growth and virulence on substrates containing toxic compounds.”

Fungi could be weaponized as pest control in the future. The researchers think it is possible that the genes that enable B. bassiana to detoxify antifungal substances could enable it to metabolize other defensive plant substances ingested by harmful insects. Instead of sprayers full of dangerous chemicals, exterminators may soon arrive with petri dishes instead.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. So every month, we highlight a handful of the best stories that nearly slipped through the cracks. January’s list includes a lip-syncing robot; using brewer’s yeast as scaffolding for lab-grown meat;  hunting for Leonardo da Vinci’s DNA in his art; and new evidence that humans really did transport the stones to build Stonehenge from Wales and northern Scotland, rather than being transported by glaciers.

Stonehenge is an iconic landmark of endless fascination to tourists and researchers alike. There has been a lot of recent chemical analysis identifying where all the stones that make up the structure came from, revealing that many originated in quarries a significant distance away. So how were the stones transported to their current location?

One theory holds that glaciers moved the bluestones at least part of the way from Wales to Salisbury Plain in southern England, while others contend that humans moved them—although precisely how that was done has yet to be conclusively determined. Researchers at Curtin University have now produced the strongest scientific evidence to date that it was humans, not glaciers, that transported the stones, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Curtin’s Anthony Clarke and co-authors relied on mineral fingerprinting to arrive at their conclusions. In 2024, Clarke’s team discovered the Stonehenge Altar Stone originated from the Orkney region in the very northeast corner of Scotland, rather than Wales. This time, they analyzed hundreds of zircon crystals collected from rivers close to the historic monument, looking for evidence of Pleistocene-era sediment. Per Clarke, if the stones had “sailed” to the plain from further north, there would be a distinct mineral signature in that sediment as the transported rocks eroded over time. They didn’t find that signature, making it far more likely that humans transported the stone.

Everyone knows grasshoppers can hop, but they can also flap their wings, jump, and glide, moving seamlessly across both the ground and through the air. That ability inspired scientists from Princeton University to devise a novel approach to building robotic wings, according to a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. This could one day enable multimodal locomotion for miniature robots with extended flight times.

According to the authors, grasshoppers have two sets of wings: forewings and hindwings. Forewings are mostly used for protection and camouflage, while the latter are involved in flapping and gliding, and are corrugated to allow them to fold into the insect’s body. The team took CT scans to capture the geometry of grasshopper wings and used the scans to 3D print model wings with varying designs. Next they tested each variant in a water channel to study how water flowed around the wing, isolating key features like a wing’s shape or corrugation to see how this impacted the flow.

Once they had perfected their design, they printed new wings and attached them to small frames to create grasshopper-sized gliders. The team then launched the gliders across the lab and used motion capture to evaluate how well they flew. The glider performed as well as actual grasshoppers. In addition, they found that a smooth wing resulted in more efficient gliding. So why do real grasshopper wings have corrugations? The authors suggest that these evolved because they help with executing steep angles.

Humanoid robots are fascinating, but nobody would mistake them for actual humans, in part because even the ones that have faces are far too limited in facial gestures, including lip motion—hence, the “Uncanny Valley.” Columbia University engineers have now created a robot capable of learning facial lip motions for speaking and singing. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the resulting robotic face was able to speak words in several different languages and sing an AI-generated song. (Its AI-generated debut album is aptly titled hello world.).

What makes human faces so uniquely capable of expression are the dozens of muscles lying just under the skin. Robotic faces are rigid and hence only have a limited range of motion. The Columbia team built their robotic face out of flexible material augmented with 26 motors (actuators). The robot learned to how its face moved in response to different actuator activity by watching itself in a mirror as it attempted thousands of random facial expressions. Eventually it learned how to achieve specific facial gestures.

The next step was to let the robot watch recorded videos of humans talking and singing, augmented with an AI algorithm that enabled it to learn exactly how the human mouths moved when performing those tasks so it could lip sync along. The resulting lip motion wasn’t perfect;  the robot struggled with “B” and “W” sounds in particular. But the authors believe the robot will improve with more practice; combining this ability with ChatGPT or Gemini could further improve its lip-syncing ability.

In 2020, scientists analyzed the microbes found on several of Leonardo da Vinci’s drawings and discovered that each had its own distinct microbiome/. A second team, working with the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project in France, collected and analyzed swabs taken from centuries-old art in a private collection housed in Florence, Italy. They concluded that microbial signatures could be used to differentiate artwork according to the materials used—dubbing this emerging subfield “arteomics.”

Yet another team collaborating with the project painstakingly assembled Leonardo’s family tree in 2021, spanning 21 generations from 1331 to the present, resulting a full-length book published last year. The idea was that this will one day provide a means of conducting DNA testing to confirm whether the bones interred in Leonardo’s grave are actually the his. And now the project’s scientists are back with a preprint posted to the bioRxiv, announcing the successful sequencing of human DNA collected from a handful of artifacts associated with Leonardo—including a drawing of the Holy Child that some scholars attribute to Leonardo, as well as letters from a da Vinci family member.

The team lightly swabbed samples from the artifacts’ surfaces and were able to recover human Y-chromosome sequences from several of the samples. Several of these sequences were related and the authors speculate that some might even be Leonardo’s, although they cautioned that the samples would need to be compared to samples taken from the artist’s notebooks, burial site, and family tomb to make a definitive identification. The authors also found DNA from bacteria, fungi, flowers, and animals in some of the samples, as well as traces of viruses and parasites.

Lab-grown meat is often touted as a more environmentally responsible alternative to the real deal, but carnivorous consumers are often put off by the unappealing mouthfeel and texture (and, for me, a weird oily aftertaste). A new method using spent brewer’s yeast to make edible “scaffolding” for cultivating meat in the lab might one day offer a solution, according to a paper published in the journal Frontiers in  Nutrition.

Typically, a nutrient broth is used as a source of bacteria for the scaffolding. But Richard Day of University College London and his co-authors decided to use brewer’s yeast, usually discarded as waste, to culture a species of bacteria known for making high-quality cellulose. Then they tested the mechanical and structural properties of that cellulose with a “chewing machine.” They concluded that the cellulose made from spent brewer’s yeast was much closer in texture to real meat than the cellulose scaffolding made from a nutrient broth. The next step is to incorporate fat and muscle cells into the cellulose, as well as testing yeast from different kinds of beer.

Gears have been around for thousands of years; the Chinese were using them in two-wheeled chariots as far back as 3000 BCE, and they are a mainstay in windmills, clocks, and the famed Antikythera mechanism. Roboticists also use gears in their inventions, but whether they are made of wood, metal or plastic, such gears tend to be inflexible and hence more prone to breakage. That’s why New York University mathematician Leif Reistroph and colleagues decided to see if flowing air or water could be used to rotate robotic structures.

Ristroph’s lab frequently addresses all manner of colorful real-world puzzles: fine-tuning the recipe for the perfect bubble, for instance; exploring the physics of the Hula-Hoop; or the formation processes underlying so-called “stone forests” common in China and Madagascar. In 2021, his lab built a working Tesla valve, in accordance with the inventor’s design; the following year they studied the complex aerodynamics of what makes a good paper airplane—specifically what is needed for smooth gliding; and in 2024 they cracked the conundrum of the “reverse sprinkler” problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, had grappled with since the 1940s.

For their latest paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, Ristroph et al. wanted to devise something that functioned like a gear only with flowing liquid driving the motion, instead of teeth grinding against each other. They conducted a series of experiments in which they immersed cylindrical rotors in a glycerol-and-water solution. One cylinder would rotate while the other was passive.

They found that the rotating cylinder, combined with fluid flow, was sufficient to induce rotation in the passive cylinder. The flows functioned much in the same way as gear teeth when the cylinders were close together. Moving the cylinders further apart caused the active cylinder to rotate faster, looping the flows around the passive cylinder—essentially mimicking a belt and pulley system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind.

Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression.

A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.

The study has not yet been published. But MindBio’s CEO Justin Hanka recently released the top-line results on his LinkedIn, eager to show that his company was “in front of the curve in microdosing research.” He called it “the most vigorous placebo controlled trial ever performed in microdosing.” It found that patients dosed with a small amount of LSD (ranging from 4 to 20μg, or micrograms, well below the threshold of a mind-blowing hallucinogenic dose) showed observable upticks in feelings of well-being, but worse MADRS scores, compared to patients given a placebo in the form of a caffeine pill. (Because patients in psychedelic trials typically expect some kind of mind-altering effect, studies are often blinded using so-called “active placebos,” like caffeine or methylphenidate, which have their own observable psychoactive properties.)

This means, essentially, that a medium-strength cup of coffee may prove more beneficial in treating major depressive disorder than a tiny dose of acid. Good news for habitual caffeine users, perhaps, but less so for researchers (and biopharma startups) counting on the efficacy of psychedelic microdosing.

“It’s probably a nail in the coffin of using microdosing to treat clinical depression,” Hanka says. “It probably improves the way depressed people feel—just not enough to be clinically significant or statistically meaningful.”

However despairing, these results conform with the suspicions of some more skeptical researchers, who have long believed that the benefits of microdosing are less the result of a teeny-tiny psychedelic catalyst, and more attributable to the so-called “placebo effect.”

In 2020, Jay A. Olson, then a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, conducted an experiment. He gave 33 participants a placebo, telling them it was actually a dose of a psilocybin-like drug. They were led to believe there was no placebo group. Other researchers who were in on the bit acted out the effects of the drug, in a room treated with trippy lighting and other visual stimulants, in an attempt to curate the “optimized expectation” of a psychedelic experience.

The resulting paper, titled “Tripping on Nothing,” found that a majority of participants had reported feeling the effects of the drug—despite there being no real drug whatsoever. “The main conclusion we had is that the placebo effect can be stronger than expected in psychedelic studies,” Olson, now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, tells WIRED. “Placebo effects were stronger than what you would get from microdosing.”

More than a stick in the eye to the microdosing faithful, Olson maintains that the study’s key findings had more to do with the actual role, and power, of the placebo effect. “The public has a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect,” he says. “There’s this assumption that placebo effects are extremely weak, or that they’re not real.”

Olson goes on to say that placebo effects in psychedelic trials can be further juiced by the hype around the drugs themselves. Patients may enter a trial expecting a certain experience, and their mind is able to conjure a version of that experience, in turn. In Olson’s study, it wasn’t a matter of microdosing effects not being real, but that those effects may be caused by environment, or patient expectation. As he puts it: “It can be true at the same time that microdosing can have positive effects on people, and that those effects are perhaps almost entirely placebo.”

This itself raises a sticky question about MindBio’s study. How could a placebo group, who thinks they’re taking LSD, perform better than an active control group, members of which both think they’re taking LSD and are actually taking it? The answer comes from the design of the study itself.

Using what’s called a “double-dummy” design, MindBio’s researchers informed patients that they’d either be receiving LSD, a caffeine pill, or a dose of methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin or Concerta. (No patients were actually administered the methylphenidate.) This means that patient expectation was lowered, as they could ascribe any perceived effects to either the LSD or either of the active placebos. Patients taking LSD microdoses may well have believed they were merely on a stimulant. All patients followed an adaptation of the “Fadiman protocol,” a popular microdosing programme that sees patients taking a small dose of the given drug once every three days.

Jim Fadiman, the veteran psychedelic researcher after whom the protocol is named, rejects MindBio’s conclusions, and trial design, out of hand. Because, Fadiman believes, patients were given the active caffeine placebo, their reported benefits may well be attributable not to a pure placebo effect, but to the actual psychoactive properties of that drug.

“Double-dummy is a remarkably apt term,” Fadiman, 86, sneers. “What I know is that if you take enough caffeine, you will not be depressed!”

Fadiman points to MindBio’s earlier, Phase 2A study, recently published in the journal Neuropharmacology, which drew markedly different conclusions. It was a non-blinded, so-called “open label” study, meaning patients knew definitely that they were being microdosed with LSD. This study found that MADRS scores decreased by 59.5 percent, with effects lasting as long as six months. It also found improvements in stress, rumination, anxiety, and patient quality of life. Fadiman says that this reportage is more consistent with his own research on microdosing. “Their prior study did wonderfully with LSD,” Fadiman says. “I have collected literally hundreds of real world reports over the years that validate those findings.”

MindBio’s Hanka stands by the science. “We are bewildered at the significant difference between the open label Phase 2A trial results and the Phase 2B trial results,” he says. “But that is the nature of good science—a properly controlled trial will get a proper result. Our Phase 2B trial was of the highest standard, a triple-blind, double-dummy, active placebo controlled trial. I haven’t seen another psychedelic trial that has gone to these lengths to control and blind a trial.”

Despite these findings, some microdosing true believers don’t seem especially shaken. In 2017, writer Ayelet Waldman (best known as the author of the Mommy-Track Mysteries series of novels that follow the adventures of stay-at-home-mom-cum-sleuth Juliet Applebaum) published A Really Good Day, a diaristic account of her own self-experiments using microdosing to treat an intractable mood disorder. She tells WIRED she’s not especially bothered by the implication that her positive shifts in mood may have merely been placebo. “In my book I took very seriously the possibility that what I was experiencing was the mother of all placebo effects,” Waldman says. “I wrote about this a number of times in various chapters and decided in the end it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I felt better.”

Perhaps that’s true enough. If the effects are measurable, and repeatable, then it should hardly matter if they’re attributable to a sub-perceptual dose of lysergic acid, or to the (perhaps equally profound) mysteries of the placebo. Still, one cannot help but wonder why anyone looking to use LSD to aid severe clinical depression would bother assuming the legal risk of procuring and consuming a drug still classified under Schedule I by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.

Certainly, for his part, Justin Hanka seems content to pivot MindBio’s research into a new field. His next project is “Booze A.I.”: a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to scan the human voice for relevant biomarkers that determine blood alcohol concentration. He’s leaving microdosing in the rearview. “I put millions of dollars into this myself,” he says. “Had I known six years ago what I know about psychedelics, I probably wouldn’t have ventured into the microdosing field.”

            <h2>The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/lg-joins-the-rest-of-the-world-accepts-that-people-dont-want-8k-tvs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.

In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the first 8K TVs started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the first 8K TVs in the US, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an 8K computer monitor. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the industry’s claim that 8K TVs were “the future.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.

LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels, FlatpanelsHD reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative told FlatpanelsHD that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”

“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

LG Electronics was the first and only company to sell 8K OLED TVs, starting with the 88-inch Z9 in 2019. In 2022, it lowered the price-of-entry for an 8K OLED TV by $7,000 by charging $13,000 for a 76.7-inch TV.

FlatpanelsHD cited anonymous sources who said that LG Electronics would no longer restock the 2024 QNED99T, which is the last LCD 8K TV that it released.

LG’s 8K abandonment follows other brands distancing themselves from 8K. TCL, which released its last 8K TV in 2021, said in 2023 that it wasn’t making more 8K TVs due to low demand. Sony discontinued its last 8K TVs in April and is unlikely to return to the market, as it plans to sell the majority ownership of its Bravia TVs to TCL.

The tech industry tried to convince people that the 8K living room was coming soon. But since the 2010s, people have mostly adopted 4K. In September 2024, research firm Omdia reported that there were “nearly 1 billion 4K TVs currently in use.” In comparison, 1.6 million 8K TVs had been sold since 2015, Paul Gray, Omdia’s TV and video technology analyst, said, noting that 8K TV sales peaked in 2022.

That helps explain why membership at the 8K Association, launched by stakeholders Samsung, TCL, Hisense, and panel maker AU Optronics in 2019, is dwindling. As of this writing, the group’s membership page lists 16 companies, including just two TV manufacturers (Samsung and Panasonic). Membership no longer includes any major TV panel suppliers. At the end of 2022, the 8K Association had 33 members, per an archived version of the nonprofit’s online membership page via the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Upon its debut, the 8K Association said that its goals include “promoting 8K TVs and 8K content to consumers and professionals” and “helping secure 8K native content for members.”

It wasn’t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn’t take off. In addition to being too expensive for many households, there’s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile. An ongoing lack of content was also easy to predict, given that there’s still a dearth of 4K content, and many streaming, broadcasting, and gaming users still rely on 1920×1080 resolution.

Gaming was supposed to be one of the best drivers for 8K adoption. The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro was originally marketed as supporting 8K. Sony officially rescinded that promise in June 2024, though. Due to bandwidth limitations, the PS5 Pro could only deliver 8K via Display Stream Compression over HDMI 2.1, making the feature incompatible with some 8K TVs.

There’s also the crucial question of whether people would even notice the difference between 4K and 8K. Science suggests that you could, but in limited situations.

The University of Cambridge’s display resolution calculator, which is based on a study from researchers at the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology and Meta, funded by Meta, and published in Nature in October, suggests that your eyes can only make use of 8K resolution on a 50-inch screen if you’re viewing it from a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or less. Similarly, you would have to be sitting pretty close (2–3 meters/6.6–9.8 feet) to an 80-inch or 100-inch TV for 8K resolution to be beneficial. The findings are similar to those from RTINGs.com.

Even those interested in spending a lot of money on new-age TV technologies are more likely to investigate features other than 8K, like OLED, HDR support, Micro LED, quantum dots, or even the newer Micro RGB panel tech. Any of those is likely to have a more dramatic impact on home theaters than moving from 4K to 8K.

With the above-mentioned obstacles, many technologists foresaw 8K failing to live up to tech companies’ promises. That’s not to say that 8K is dead. You can still buy an 8K TV from Samsung, which has 8K TVs with MSRPs starting at $2,500 (for 65 inches), and LG (until stock runs out). With manufacturers refraining from completely ruling out a return to 8K, it’s possible that 8K TVs will become relevant for enthusiasts or niche use cases for many years. And there are uses for high-resolution displays outside of TVs, like in head-mounted displays.

However, 8K TV options are shrinking. We’re far from the days when companies argued over which had the most “real 8K” TVs. If there is a future where 8K TVs reign, it’s one far from today.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a declaration filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.

Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”

Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.

“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”

Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a Boston Globe column about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.

Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:

I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”

I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.

Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.

“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”

Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”

We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.

Federal agents have made extensive use of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from Clearview AI and a face-scanning app called Mobile Fortify. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.

“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times reported today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.

ICE also uses a variety of other technologies, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and Palantir software to help identify potential deportation targets.

Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.

“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve come across video after video of humanoid robots performing backflips, delivering punches — and even a clip of a robot kicking the CEO of its maker squarely in the chest.

Don’t get us wrong, the aerobatics on display are impressive — but it’s not hugely practical, since it’s not like we’re being swarmed by waves of armed bad guys on a daily basis.

Fortunately, not every robotics maker is doubling down on martial arts. Case in point, California-based company Figure recently introduced the second iteration of its humanoid robot AI software, called Helix 02. In a video released this week, the company’s black-and-white android, dubbed Figure 02, can be seen seamlessly unloading a dishwasher and placing clean dishes in upper cabinets and drawers before loading dirty dishes back into it.

It’s an impressive demo. Certain human-like flourishes highlight how Helix 02 was relying on motion-captured training data, from using its foot to kick up the opened dishwasher door to bumping a drawer closed with its hip.

The company claims in a press release that a “single neural system” can control the “full body directly from pixels, enabling dexterous, long horizon autonomy across an entire room.”

The dishwasher demonstration is a “four-minute, end-to-end autonomous task that integrates walking, manipulation, and balance with no resets and no human intervention,” per Figure. “We believe this is the longest horizon, most complex task completed autonomously by a humanoid robot to date.”

Helix 02’s dishwasher mastery was the result of being trained on over 1,000 hours of “human motion data and sim‑to‑real reinforcement learning,” the company claimed. And it’s not a one-hit wonder: we’ve already seen Figure 02 deftly sort packages at a logistics warehouse, load a washing machine, and even fold laundry.

However, how the robot would fare in a different — and perhaps far messier — kitchen remains to be seen. Flashy tech demos like this one should always be taken with a grain of salt, particularly when they’re meant to convey how robots could one day navigate an unpredictable real-world environment, rather than a carefully set-up and controlled stage.

            <div id="article-text">New York City’s mayor isn’t even a month into his term, and he’s already delivering a crushing blow to delivery app companies.

In a bombshell intervention, Zohran Mamdani and Department of Consumer and Worker Protection commissioner Sam Levine announced that three delivery apps will be forced to repay $4.6 million in wages held back from deliveristas, New York City’s app-based delivery workers.

According to NYC Streetblog, the three main culprits being forced to settle are Uber Eats, Fantuan, and Hungry Panda. The three settlements were the result of a sweeping investigation into broader delivery app practices, which included GrubHub and DoorDash.

“The era of giant corporations juicing profits by underpaying workers is over,” Levine said in a statement. “I’m proud that this agency is not only returning full back pay, but is recovering damages and penalties to send a strong message that cheating workers will not be tolerated.”

Per the mayoral administration, Uber Eats unfairly deactivated and underpaid thousands of workers between December 4, 2023, and September 2, 2024. It’s now being forced to pay $3,150,000 in worker relief penalties across over 48,000 workers, in amounts ranging from $8.79 to $276.15.

In addition, Uber Eats will have to pay the city of New York $350,000 in civil fines — a drop in the bucket compared to the $13.7 billion in revenue the company brought in throughout 2024, but a win for the worker-friendly administration all the same.

The decision strikes a major blow to an industry that has historically relied on its political and financial largess to avoid consequences for horrifying worker abuses resulting from algorithmic management systems.

“For years, app companies treated the law as optional — hiding behind algorithms, stealing wages, and deactivating workers without consequence,” Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers’ Justice Project, told NYC Streetblog in a statement. “The scale of these abuses proves what deliveristas have been saying for years: exploitation is not an accident — it’s baked into the app delivery business model.”

James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, concurred.

“For far too long, delivery and other online labor platform companies have not only underpaid workers, but deactivated them with abandon, denying workers the ability to make a living,” he said.

Perhaps surprisingly, Uber hasn’t denied any wrongdoing and went as far as to thank officials for bringing light to the issue.

In a statement to NYC Streetblog, Uber spokesman Josh Gold said that “we’re glad to have this resolved.”

“After DCWP notified us of the issue in August 2024, we immediately corrected it, agreed to pay more than the amount owed, and appreciate the new administration moving quickly to bring this to a fair conclusion,” he said.

            <h2>New Study Examines How Often AI Psychosis Actually Happens, and the Results Are Not Good</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’ve seen plenty of evidence suggesting that prolonged use of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT can coax some users into spirals of paranoid and delusional behavior.

The phenomenon, dubbed “AI psychosis,” is a very real problem, with researchers warning of a huge wave of severe mental health crises brought on by the tech. In extreme cases, especially involving people with pre-existing conditions, the breaks with reality have even been linked suicides and murder.

Now, thanks to a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper published by researchers at Anthropic and the University of Toronto, we’re beginning to grasp just how widespread the issue really is.

The researchers set out to quantify patterns of what they called “user disempowerment” in “real-world [large language model] usage” — including what they call “reality distortion,” “belief distortion,” and “action distortion” to denote a range of situations in which AI twists users’ sense of reality, beliefs, or pushes them into taking actions.

The results tell a damning story. The researchers found that one in 1,300 conversations out of almost 1.5 million analyzed chats with Anthropic’s Claude led to reality distortion, and one in 6,000 conversations led to action distortion.

To come to their conclusion, the researchers ran 1.5 million Claude conversations through an analysis tool called Clio to identify instances of “disempowerment.”

On the face, that may not sound like a huge proportion given the scale of the much larger dataset — but in absolute numbers, the research highlights a phenomenon that’s affecting huge numbers of people.

“We find the rates of severe disempowerment potential are relatively low,” the researchers concluded. “For instance, severe reality distortion potential, the most common severe-level primitive, occurs in fewer than one in every thousand conversations.”

“Nevertheless, given the scale of AI usage, even these low rates translate to meaningful absolute numbers,” they added. “Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.”

Worse yet, they found evidence that the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment increased between late 2024 and late 2025, indicating that the problem is growing as AI use spreads.

“As exposure grows, users might become more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice,” the researchers wrote in the blog post.

Additionally, the team found that user feedback — in the form of an optional thumbs up or down button at the end of a given conversation with Claude — indicated that users “rate potentially disempowering interactions more favorably,” according to an accompanying blog post on Anthropic’s website.

In other words, users are more likely to come away satisfied when their reality or beliefs are being distorted, highlighting the role of sycophancy, or the strong tendency of AI chatbots to validate a user’s feelings and beliefs.

Plenty of fundamental questions remain. The researchers were upfront about admitting that they “can’t pinpoint why” the prevalence of moderate or severe disempowerment potential is growing. Their dataset is also limited to Claude consumer traffic, “which limits generalizability.” We also don’t know how many of these identified cases led to real-world harm, as the research only focused on “disempowerment potential” and not “confirmed harm.”

The team called for improved “user education” to make sure people aren’t giving up their full judgment to AI as “model-side interventions are unlikely to fully address the problem.”

Nonetheless, the researchers say the research is only a “first step” to learn how “AI might undermine human agency.”

“We can only address these patterns if we can measure them,” they argued.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, the cultivated meat industry has struggled to emerge as a practical alternative to the brutal factory farming sector. The key reason? Perhaps not that lab grown meat isn’t a viable product, but that intense regulations have strangled it in the cradle.

A new analysis by the food industry publication Just Food found that the majority of cultivated meat companies — those working to bring cell-cultured meat to market — have struggled thanks to a lack of regulatory approvals from government food agencies. Despite a ton of early investor interest in these kinds of companies and an increasingly competitive price point, many are being forced to shutter operations before they can get a product to shelves.

“While it’s disappointing to see company closures, as with any highly innovative sector, not all companies will make it through the tough early stages,” Carlotte Lucas, industry head at Good Food Institute Europe told Just Food.

“However, regulatory inefficiencies, such as longer, unpredictable approval times, have been a critical barrier for companies hoping to bring products to market and have led to some start-ups considering other regions or even relocating overseas,” Lucas continued.

Without regulatory approval in regions like Europe and North America, lab-grown meat startups can’t scale their operations into the kinds of consumer markets that have expressed interest in alternative meats. Instead, they tend to find niche buyers in the restaurant industry, with mixed success.

“While the regulatory work is essential, it’s very resource intensive, it’s very time intensive, and each player needs to go through that process,” Erika Georget, managing director of The Cultured Hub told Just Food.

Georget suggests that scaling up biomass production is essential for success in the lab-grown meat industry — biomass referring to the animal cells utilized in growing cultivated meat. It puts lab-grown meat companies in a paradoxical bind: startups need regulatory approval to scale commercially, but also need commercial scale to survive the regulatory process.

“Even for those that have had approval for restaurants and so on, a challenge is that companies don’t have enough quantity yet to really serve a classical retail business and at an acceptable cost based on pure biomass,” Georget told the outlet.

Until regulators create clearer, faster pathways to approval, cultivated meat risks becoming a cautionary tale of urgently-needed innovation killed by bureaucratic overreach.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple says their Tesla Cybertruck nearly dumped their baby onto the side of the highway after its passenger door latch failed, The Oaklandside reports.

The husband, Oakland resident Viral Shah, says he and his wife were driving up a ramp to get on the highway when the back passenger door next to their one-year-old child suddenly swung open. Shah and his wife screamed and immediately pulled over to check on their kid. Fortunately, the car seat saved the baby from being flung out the car, but it was an alarmingly close call. And had the 60-pound stainless steel-clad door swung back closed, it could have smashed the child’s hand or arm.

If anyone had been sitting back there without a seatbelt, Shah told The Oaklandside, “they would’ve been mush on the street.” His wife had to take the child’s seat, buckle herself in, and hold the door closed for the rest of the drive home. ​​”This is f*cking nuts,” she said, Shah recalled.

Upon inspecting the passenger door, Shah discovered that the metal loop that the car door latch hooked into, called a striker, was missing one of its two screws and had come loose. He also found that the driver door had a screw loose as well. Alarmed, he submitted a complaint to the National High Traffic Safety Administration.

“That’s what made me really scared and furious, because this wasn’t a simple defect,” he told The Oaklandside. “This wasn’t an oversight with one thing where shit happens. This was a systemic design flaw that was affecting those two doors because they were the most heavily used.”

“There’s no doubt in my mind the same thing would happen to all four doors had they been used with the same level of frequency,” he added.

An expert who reviewed photos and videos taken by Shah and his wife suspected that the “weld-nuts” on the backside of the door’s steel pillar appeared to improperly welded, gradually dislodging as the doors were shut.

“This should never, ever happen, but weld-nuts do occasionally break free if there is a process or setup error in the welding equipment or if protective coatings that are used to limit corrosion during shipping of parts are not properly cleaned,” Sam Abuelsamid, a car engineer and vice president of market research at Telemetry, told Oaklandside.

The Cybertruck has been recalled a staggering ten times, a number that probably flatters the vehicle, as it has been accused of all kinds of serious reliability issues beyond those that became official record. Many of the recalls, in any case, were pretty serious. One was for its accelerator pedal getting stuck in the down position, and another was for losing power while driving. It’s also been recalled for other body-related issues, including its stainless steel panels flying off because they were adhered with crummy glue.

The latches aren’t the only apparent issue. Other aspects of the electric doors, which do not have a traditional handle, have been criticized for being unsafe. The doors are operated by a push button from both the outside and inside, systems that can easily fail in an accident. And critics say its emergency release mechanisms are too hidden and impractical. In 2024, three recent high school graduates died after being trapped in a Cybertruck that crashed and caught fire. A bystander at the scene tried to let them free, but couldn’t open the electric doors after the buttons failed.

Shah said that after his incident, he took the vehicle to a Tesla service center, which admitted on an invoice that the rear passenger door was “damaged due to a loose striker.” Tesla offered to buy back the vehicle for nearly its full purchase price, so long as he agreed not to sue the automaker. He took the offer.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How the most massive objects in the universe first formed is one of the biggest headscratchers in astrophysics. With more advanced telescopes, astronomers have found fully formed galaxies and colossal black holes earlier and earlier in the cosmos, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. This shouldn’t be enough time for these structures to reach their incredible size; to astronomers, it’s like stumbling on a fully-grown oak tree that’s only a year old.

The dilemma was put into hyperdrive by the James Webb Space Telescope’s discovery of extremely bright “Little Red Dots” that were present when the universe was less than a billion years old, and are nowhere to be seen today. Though they’re suspected to be some kind of compact galaxy, they would be almost impossibly dense at the mass they appear to have, wall-to-wall with stars, according to Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of a new study investigating the red objects published in the journal Nature.

“They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing,” he told Ars Technica. “Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”

Another proposed explanation is that they’re some kind of supermassive black hole. But this, too, is fraught: the red dots show no signs of the x-ray emissions produced by these objects. And if they were black holes, they would be “overmassive,” weighing nearly as much as their entire surrounding galaxy, something that’s never been observed in a conventional galaxy. How such an enormous monstrosity could form when the universe was still in its infancy is equally baffling.

Thankfully, there may be a very tidy explanation. In his study, Rusakov and his team found that the gasses observed in the Little Red Dots, which astronomers use to infer the mass of invisible black holes, weren’t moving as quickly as once thought. If so, that means that the black holes are around 100 times less massive than previously estimated.

The upshot is that the supposedly “overmassive” behemoths are actually just young supermassive black holes. But if that’s the case, why don’t they resemble any black holes that we’re seeing today? The astronomers suggests that we may be witnessing a previously unknown “cocoon” stage of their evolution, during which they feed off of a dense, protective shell of ionized gas.

“They look like a [developing] butterfly or something in this young state that kind of grows wrapped in some sort of gas that also feeds it,” Rusakov told Ars. “It’s definitely new in the sense people didn’t predict there should be such a cocoon phase in the supermassive black holes’ lifecycle.”

In addition to feeding the black hole, the cocoon would also block the x-ray emissions we would expect to see, explaining their absence.

It’s probably one of the tidiest solutions out there to the Little Red Dots mystery, though there are more than a few. Other research suggests that they’re galaxies which are unusually tiny because they haven’t spun up to speed. An even bolder hypothesis proposes they’re “black hole stars” consisting of a black hole core surrounded by a sphere of gas so dense that it resembles the outer layers of a star. But if Rusakov and his team are on the right track, it raises another significant question that’s been haunting astronomers. “Does the galaxy start with the supermassive black hole or with the stars?” Rusakov pondered. “Is that a chicken or the egg?”

“We don’t know exactly what happens in this first sort of stage of galaxy formation,” he added. “But our model gives us a new way to look at this kind of object.

In our mature cosmos, black holes are formed from the collapse of dying star, but in the earliest moments of its existence, the extreme conditions may have given birth to these objects all around, long before the first stars would be born.

            <div id="article-text">Digital meeting notetakers like Read AI, Fireflies.ai, Fathom, and Granola help record and transcribe online meetings. But for in-person or more versatile options, many people prefer physical recording devices These physical notetakers transcribe audio and give users summaries and action items of meetings using AI.

Some of these devices are wearable—pins or pendants with dedicated mics for recording—while others are credit-card sized with dedicated mobile apps to transcribe and extract insights using AI. A few even offer live translation.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of physical AI notetakers and transcription tools.

This credit card-sized notetaker has been around since 2023, with a newer, AI-powered Pro version that has a small screen, four mics, and records audio within three to five meters. It also can switch between in-person recording and call recording.

The Plaud Note costs $159, while the Note Pro costs $179. They come with 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

Mobvi’s rectangular notetaker is priced at $159 and includes 600 free transcription minutes. The company claims the device shows real-time transcription and translation with support for more than 120 languages. The device offers 25 hours of continuous recording through its three microphones.

In terms of software features, the TicNote offers automatic highlight extraction and the ability to create audio clips or summarized podcast versions of a conversation.

Comulytic is a newer entrant in the hardware AI notetaker market. The company’s claim for differentiation is that its $159 Note Pro device doesn’t require any additional subscription for basic transcription. That means you can transcribe unlimited minutes by just buying the device.

The device can record up to 45 hours of audio continuously on a single charge and has more than 100 days of standby time.

The company has a $15 per month or $119 per year advanced plan that offers instant AI summaries, unlimited templates for summaries, an action item list, and chat with AI assistant without any limits.

Plaud NotePin and NotePin S are the smaller and more pocketable versions of the company’s larger Note and Note Pro devices. The NotePin has a versatile design: You can wear it as a wrist band, a pendant, clip it to your bag, or wear it on your shirt with a magnetic attachment. Notably, the lanyard and wristband are only available with the NotePin S.

Both devices have two mics, and can record around 20 hours of audio continuously on a single charge. The NotePin S has a physical button to start/stop recording and capture highlights.

Both are similarly priced to their credit-card-shaped counterparts. The NotePin is priced at $159, and the NotePin S is priced at $179.

The Omi pendant is a cheaper alternative to other notetakers at $89. This is because the pendant has to be connected to your phone and doesn’t have any onboard memory. The device has two mics and can run for 10 to 14 hours on a charge.

While Omi has its own app, you can use other apps as the hardware and software are open-sourced. Users have also built different connectors and apps for the device.

Viaim’s earbuds allow for transcription during calls, with additional recording capabilities in the earbuds’ case. These buds are priced at $200 and Viaim claims they can transcribe audio in up to 78 languages in real-time. The company’s app can also highlight key points in transcriptions.

Anker’s Soundcore Work pin is a coin-sized AI notetaker with a puck-shaped battery pack. The $159 device can record for eight hours without breaks, or up to 32 hours if the pin is attached to its case, the company says.

Anker claims that the device has a five-meter recording range. Users get 300 minutes of transcription free per month.

            <div id="article-text">TikTok, which is under new ownership in the U.S., said Sunday that it has restored service after outages last week that marred user experiences. The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.

The company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.

“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.

In January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a controlling 80% stake, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.

Following the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features like posting, searching within the app, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it was working on solving the issue, but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.

TikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than 380,000 users in the week the deal was finalized. Upscrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was downloaded 41,000 times within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm AppFigures.

            <h2>AI layoffs or ‘AI-washing’?</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/ai-layoffs-or-ai-washing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How many of the companies with recent layoffs are truly adapting their workforces to the efficiencies and challenges of artificial intelligence? And how many of them were just using AI as an excuse to cover other problems?

That’s the question posed by a New York Times article on the trend of “AI-washing,” where companies will cite AI as the reason for layoffs that might actually be caused by other factors, like over-hiring during the pandemic.

AI was the stated reason for more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025, with Amazon and Pinterest among the tech companies who blamed the technology for recent cuts.

But a Forrester report published in January argued, “Many companies announcing A.I.-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted A.I. applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘A.I.-washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future A.I. implementation.”

Molly Kinder, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institute, noted that saying layoffs were caused by AI is a “very investor-friendly message,” especially when the alternative might mean admitting, “The business is ailing.”

            <h2>Why Tether’s CEO is everywhere right now</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/01/why-tethers-ceo-is-everywhere-right-now/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you read the news, you might have noticed a trend this past week. In addition to splashy features in Fortune and Bloomberg, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked with Reuters, He also talked with TechCrunch. Why did the man behind the stablecoin that everyone loves to hate launch a full-scale media blitz?

The timing isn’t arbitrary. This week, Tether launched USAT, a U.S.-regulated stablecoin issued through Anchorage Digital Bank — its first product designed to comply with new federal rules and compete directly with Circle’s USDC. Fidelity Investments also just launched a competing stablecoin on Wednesday, joining JPMorgan Chase and PayPal in a broadening race.

It’s a big shift from one extreme to the other. For years, Ardoino avoided the United States, watching from offshore as regulators circled and prosecutors investigated. His company was portrayed as opaque, possibly fraudulent, and, according to a piece by The Economist last summer, a “money launderer’s dream.”

But when Ardoino and I chatted by video call this week, it was clear those days are over. Tether is meeting with White House officials, collaborating with the FBI and Secret Service, and betting USAT can break Circle’s grip on the U.S. market. (USAT is separate from Tether’s flagship USDT, which has $187 billion in circulation globally but doesn’t meet new U.S. regulatory requirements.) Speaking from Lugano, Switzerland, where Tether maintains an office, the 41-year-old – who joined the company just two months after its 2014 launch – spent over an hour describing Tether’s transformation from a crypto play to mainstream acceptance.

Its momentum is undeniable, certainly. Tether’s USDT — essentially a digital dollar that uses blockchain technology to move across borders without being tied to any single institution — has a market capitalization larger than all of its stablecoin competitors combined. It also has some 536 million users, growing at 30 million per quarter. “It’s growing at a pace more like Facebook rather than any other fintech application,” Ardoino tells me.

Tether’s first-mover advantage goes beyond market dominance, says Ardoino, describing it as transformative for people in countries with weak currencies. “In Argentina, the peso lost 94.5% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years,” he observes. “In Haiti, the average salary is $1.34 per day. These people were never part of the financial system.”

“What Tether created is the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity,” he continues.

Ardoino knows he has a lot of work to do to convert more people into believers. It didn’t help when, last summer, The Economist detailed how Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova allegedly used Tether to connect British drug gangs, Moscow hackers, sanctioned oligarchs, and Russian intelligence operatives.

When I bring up that reporting, Ardoino brushes it off, calling the amounts highlighted in the piece “truly a drop in the ocean.” The “infinite, vast majority of the usage of USDT is by good people,” he says, adding that the company now works with almost 300 law enforcement agencies across more than 60 countries. “iPhones are sometimes used by bad people, Toyotas are used by bad people.”

But he goes even further, arguing that his company’s technology makes it superior to cash when it comes to monitoring illicit activity. “If there are cash pallets of hundreds of billions of dollars roaming around the world, U.S. law enforcement can hardly do anything about it,” he says. “But with USDT, we demonstrated that working with the DOJ, FBI, Secret Service and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies, we could quickly freeze the funds.”

In fact, according to Ardoino, Tether has frozen $3.5 billion in tokens, the vast majority of which belonged to “people who have been scammed or hacked.” In 2023, he says, for example, Tether proactively identified $225 million in a “pig-butchering scam” in the “blink of an eye” after traditional financial systems failed to catch it. (Pig-butchering scams involve scammers who befriend victims or even romance them over time before luring them into fake investments.)

“We have onboarded the FBI and the Secret Service. We follow OFAC [the office that enforces U.S. sanctions],” he tells me.

Whether critics are satisfied isn’t yet clear, but Tether has survived every attempt to bring it down. It’s an ongoing battle. Just three months ago, the S&P Global Ratings called USDT’s stability weak.

When I raise this point, Ardoino is dismissive. “If that is the same S&P that completely missed the subprimes, I’m proud they’re considering us weak.”

He then points to spring 2022, when another major stablecoin called TerraLuna abruptly collapsed, wiping out $40 billion in value virtually overnight. Panic spread across the stablecoin market, and hedge funds bet Tether would be next to fail. Customers rushed to pull their money out. “We redeemed $7 billion in 48 hours – 10% of our reserves. In 20 days, $20 billion – 25% of our reserves. There is no bank in the world that can survive that level of redemptions. We did it with flying colors.”

Ardoino also references a rival that didn’t fare as well during a separate bank run, though he stops short of naming it. The implication is clear — he means Circle. When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in 2023, Circle’s USDC briefly lost its peg after revealing $3 billion in exposure. When I ask Ardoino directly about Circle — often portrayed as the cleaner alternative — his PR team quickly interjects. He manages only: “Sometimes you are painted in a different light if you don’t bend the knee to Wall Street.”

Ardoino emphasizes that Tether now has $30 billion in excess reserves beyond what’s needed to redeem all outstanding tokens. What’s more, those reserves are held at Cantor Fitzgerald — the Wall Street firm that Howard Lutnick led for over three decades before becoming U.S. Commerce Secretary a year ago. Lutnick has publicly vouched for Tether’s legitimacy; meanwhile the firm earns fees from managing Tether’s massive Treasury holdings, creating a financial interest that now exists alongside Lutnick’s role shaping America’s commerce policy.

Tether is now safer than traditional banks, is Ardoino’s point. “The banking system is doing fractional reserve at the length of 90%,” Ardoino says. “So if you deposit $1 million in a bank account, $100,000 is there, and $900,000 is lent out.” By contrast, he argued, “even if Bitcoin would go to zero, Tether would have more money than all the USDT tokens issued.”

All those reserves generate enormous profits. According to Fortune, Tether reported more than $15 billion in profit for 2025 derived largely from yield on reserves that — unlike with savings or checking accounts — it doesn’t share with USDT holders. When I ask whether Tether would reconsider sharing interest with its customers, Ardoino says that while interest makes sense for Americans who’ve come to expect it, it’s not top of mind for Tether’s core users, who are primarily trying to preserve value.

“The Turkish Lira lost 81% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the last five years. The Argentina peso lost 94.5%,” he says. For someone whose currency loses 3% daily, a 4% annual interest rate is meaningless. “While for the rest of the world, U.S. dollar stablecoins are the savings account, you cannot think about stablecoins for U.S. people as the savings account, but more like a checking account.”

There may be another reason Tether isn’t eager to share yields: pending legislation could make it illegal anyway. The CLARITY Act, currently moving through Congress, would prohibit stablecoin issuers from paying interest to holders, a move that banking groups support to prevent deposits from fleeing traditional banks. For Tether, its passage would simply codify its existing business model. For competitors like Circle, which have experimented with reward programs, it could eliminate a competitive tool.

Ardoino’s ambitions extend far beyond USDT. Tether Gold, a token backed by physical gold that launched in 2020, now has $2.6 billion in circulation, meaning customers hold tokens representing that much gold. But Tether’s total gold strategy is far more ambitious. According to Ardoino’s Bloomberg interview, the company holds around 140 tons of gold worth roughly $24 billion, making it one of the largest private gold holders in the world.

When I ask why Tether launched products like Tether Gold, he frames it as offering alternatives in an uncertain world. “Gold has been the first big, almost ubiquitous form of currency in humanity,” he says. “For the first time, with blockchain technology, we could actually make gold again a currency used not only as a store of value, but also a way to exchange value.”

When the gold product launched, “we were almost called crazy,” he recalls. Since then, Tether has been buying a whopping one to two tons per week, positioning itself as what Ardoino calls “one of the biggest gold central banks in the world.”

But it’s the company’s push into AI that hints at Ardoino’s even grander plans. Roughly nine months ago, Tether rolled out Qvac, Tether’s decentralized AI platform. The name comes from Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Last Question,” which Ardoino sees as the “most magnificent sci-fi piece of literature ever written.”

His pitch for Qvac echoes his pitch for USDT, which is to serve the underserved. “USDT never meant to go after people that had an account in JPMorgan,” he explains. “We went to all the people left behind by the traditional financial system.” Similarly, centralized AI platforms will miss billions of people who can’t afford subscriptions, he says.

“If they don’t have enough money for paying $150 per year for a bank account, they don’t have enough money to be onboarded on powerful AI platforms,” Ardoino says. Instead, Qvac will run locally on smartphones, as he believes within three to five years, today’s most powerful smartphones will be commonplace in Africa and South America, enabling up to 80% of AI use cases. “So USDT will empower the biggest decentralized AI platform in the world.”

It’s quite a vision, yet even Qvac is just another prong of a bigger strategy. According to Fortune, Tether has committed more than $1 billion to German AI robotics firm Neura, $775 million to social media platform Rumble, and hundreds of millions more to satellites, data centers, and agriculture. The magazine described Tether’s transformation into something resembling a sovereign wealth fund.

When I note that from the outside, these investments — including a stake in the Juventus soccer club — seem disconnected, Ardoino insists they are not. “The motto of Tether is to be the stable company,” he says. “The reason why we invest in land, cattle, agriculture, modern tech, in gold – the common denominator is ensuring that Tether can remain a cornerstone of the world that is our user.”

He describes it as an interlocking system where agriculture can be digitalized, gold markets revolutionized, telecommunications made peer-to-peer. “Our story is about building a company that can [stand] the test of time,” he says. “It’s becoming a social impact company that is changing the lives of hundreds of millions of people and providing them something they never had before – stability.”

And when I bring up political risks — what happens is the next U.S. administration views Tether as a threat, as did the last — Ardoino is ready for it.

“I hope that financial inclusion and bringing 536 million people on board onto the dollar is something that both Republicans and Democrats care about,” he says.  “It’s a matter of education.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Melania,” a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, is exceeding box office expectations, with Sunday estimates suggesting it will make $7.04 million on its opening weekend.

The documentary is coming in third overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed thriller “Send Help” ($20 million) and “Iron Lung” ($17.8 million), a video game adaptation from YouTuber Mark Fischbach (better known as Markiplier).

Amazon paid $40 million to acquire “Melania” and is reportedly spending $35 million to promote it. So even though the documentary is outperforming pre-release estimates predicting a $3 to $5 million opening weekend, it’s unlikely to make a profit in theaters.

Amazon’s bid came in $26 million ahead of the next highest bidder, Disney, leading critics to suggest the deal had less to do with the film’s box office potential and more with winning over the Trump administration. Veteran film executive Ted Hope, who worked at Amazon from 2015 to 2020, told The New York Times that the film “has to be the most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing.”

“How can it not be equated with currying favor or an outright bribe?” Hope said. “How can that not be the case?”

This is the first film directed by Brett Ratner since 2017, when multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and misconduct. (Ratner has denied those accusations.) Rolling Stone reports that two-thirds of the “Melania”‘s New York crew asked not to be formally credited in the film.

While Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a preview screening of “Melania” at the White House last weekend, “Melania” was not screened in advance for critics, and the subsequent reviews have been brutal. The documentary currently sits at 7% on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating “overwhelming dislike,” and at 10% on Rotten Tomatoes.

New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis described it as “a very circumscribed and carefully stage-managed chronicle of Mrs. Trump’s day-to-day life” during the 20 days before President Trump’s 2025 inauguration.

In a statement, Amazon MGM’s head of domestic theatrical distribution Kevin Wilson described this weekend as “an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series,” which he predicted will have a “significant life” on Amazon’s Prime streaming service.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indonesia has followed Malaysia and the Philippines in lifting a ban on xAI’s chatbot Grok.

The Southeast Asian countries banned Grok after it was used to create a flood of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery on X (now a subsidiary of xAI), including images of real women and minors. In late December and January, Grok was used to create at least 1.8 million sexualized images of women, according to separate analyses by The New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

In a statement, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said that it was lifting the ban after X sent a letter “outlining concrete steps for service improvements and the prevention of misuse” (translation via The New York Times).

Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space monitoring, said the ban is only being lifted “conditionally” and could be reinstated if “further violations are discovered.”

Malaysia and the Philippines lifted their bans on January 23.

Grok’s deepfakes have spurred criticism and investigations — but only a few outright bans — from governments around the world. In the United States, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office was investigating xAI and had sent a cease-and-desist letter ordering the company to take immediate action to end the production of these images.

xAI appears to have taken some steps to restrict Grok’s capabilities, including limiting its AI image generation feature to paying subscribers on X. CEO Elon Musk has insisted, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” and said he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.”

Documents released by the Justice Department on Friday around the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein include at least 16 emails between Musk and Epstein in 2012 and 2013, with Musk asking to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island and wondering about the “wildest party on your island.” Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution in 2008.

xAI, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks to merge with two of Musk’s other companies, SpaceX and Tesla, ahead of a SpaceX IPO.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/grammys-2026-recap-bad-bunny-ice/685852/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like a lot of immigrants lately—like a lot of Americans lately—Trevor Noah is mulling life after the United States. Early in this year’s Grammys, during an interlude between speeches and performances, the ceremony’s host asked Bad Bunny a question: “If things keep getting worse in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?”

Bad Bunny grimaced and stated the obvious: Puerto Rico is in America. Noah tried to shush him, saying, “Don’t tell them that.”

This jokey segment set the table for what turned out to be Bad Bunny’s night, at a time when the country is roiling in conflict over the nature of American identity. One week before the 31-year-old singer and rapper Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio will take the stage at the Super Bowl halftime show, he won three trophies, including the night’s final prize, Album of the Year. He was among a raft of stars who spoke out on behalf of immigrants and against ICE from the stage—but his wins, and his words, met the moment in a unique way. He’s become a political flashpoint because of where he comes from and what language he speaks, and he’s not pretending otherwise.

His first win of the night was for Best Música Urbana Album—a category established in 2022 to celebrate the ascendent strain of Spanish-language popular music of which Bad Bunny is the undisputed king. The award was presented by the Cuban-Dominican-American Saturday Night Live actor Marcello Hernández and the Colombian pop star Karol G, who riffed about the Spanish-language music their parents played around the house when they were kids. The nominees in this year’s Música Urbana category, Hernández said, are the musicians he himself will some day play around the house for his own kids.

“Before I say thanks to God, I&#39;m gonna say, ‘ICE out,”” Bad Bunny said during his speech for this award. “We’re not savage. We’re not animals. We’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” The terms he used echoed ones that Donald Trump and his followers have used to describe immigrants over the past year. Bad Bunny underplayed his anger, speaking with quiet intensity, and ended with a call to avoid hatred and to fight back with love.

The phrase he had used, “ICE Out,” was inscribed on pins sported by a number of artists at the Grammys. The 26-year-old British singer Olivia Dean, accepting the award for Best New Artist, began her speech by pointing out that she is a granddaughter of an immigrant. She added, “I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.” When Billie Eilish won the award for Song of the Year, she said, “No one is illegal on stolen land”—a common slogan at anti-ICE protests.

That Bad Bunny won Album of the Year wasn’t a huge shock: His 2025 album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, is a commercial smash and a critical darling that earned him his fourth year of being the most streamed artist in the world. What’s more, this is the first year in which all the members of the voting body for the Latin Grammys were invited to vote in the main Grammys. Even so, Bad Bunny didn’t seem like he took the victory for granted. When the singer Harry Styles, presenting the night’s big award, read out Bad Bunny’s name, the rapper looked down and covered his face with his hand. All evening, he’d looked slick and dapper in a tuxedo with corset-like stitching on the back. Now, the room was cheering, but Bad Bunny was silent and tearing up.

The speech he gave was primarily in Spanish. This also was no surprise, given that Bad Bunny only ever performs in his native language. But it was also a reminder of the historic nature of his win: DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS is the first Album of the Year sung entirely in Spanish. “I want to dedicate this award to all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams,” he said in the speech’s brief English portion. Then, in Spanish, he dedicated his win to all Latinos and the artists who deserved to be on the stage before him.

Many MAGA-aligned voices have complained about Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl booking by insinuating him as un-American, divisive, and a tool of the left’s agenda. To them, his Grammys win will likely just be taken as another offense. But the ceremony ended up being a reminder of how facile most of those complaints are. Spanish speakers and immigrants are already embedded in American life, culture, and music. To reject that reality is to reject someone like Bad Bunny, who is, by any definition, an American success story.</div>

            <h2>A Surprisingly Humane <em>SNL</em> Sketch About Changing Your Mind</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-01</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ashley Padilla’s gradual star turn on Saturday Night Live has been thrilling to watch. Since she joined the show as a featured player in 2024, on the cusp of its big 50th anniversary season, Padilla has reliably transformed innocuous-seeming characters—notably, moms—into character studies that pluck at eccentricities lurking just below the surface. In last night’s episode, Padilla’s performance as a mother admitting a change of heart in her political views marked one of her strongest roles to date.

In a sketch titled “Mom Confession,” Padilla and her husband (played by this week’s delightfully zany host, Alexander Skarsgård) were about to head to dinner with their four children, who were visiting from afar. As they all got up to leave, Padilla told her children that she first needed to share a “shocking” development with them—but wouldn’t reveal what it was unless they promised not to react. She anxiously did a couple of practice rounds to ensure they wouldn’t, announcing that she ate bugs and that her butt had fallen off: “Can’t find it,” she said sternly. She then revealed her confession in between staccato breaths: “What I have to tell you … is I may have changed my mind … about Trump.”

“Mom Confession” was one of several sketches in the episode that nodded to the latest developments in national news. Although the performance didn’t explicitly mention ICE’s brutal tactics in Minneapolis, the show was more frank elsewhere: The cold open featured former cast member Pete Davidson impersonating “border czar” Tom Homan in his attempt to take the temperature down in the city. ICE came up again in “Weekend Update,” and in the Marcello Hernández–led “Immigrant Dad Talk Show” sketch, which Hernández kicked off by addressing “all the white people that are sad about the immigrants getting deported.” But “Mom Confession” imagined how the news cycle might be playing out more intimately in some American homes, where political polarization within families has become a more salient topic since Donald Trump’s first election in 2016.

After Padilla revealed her shifting opinion on the president, her four kids couldn’t stop themselves from animatedly interjecting. Padilla swiftly unraveled, screaming back, “Stop! Do you want this to be real or not?” As the kids bit their tongues, she continued, vaguely alluding to how recent events had made her reconsider her support: “I feel now … like he might be … bad for our country.” When her exasperated children noted that they’d been saying as much for years, Padilla instantly registered their rebuttal as self-righteousness: “I’m sorry I’m late to the perfect party!”

Padilla’s mannerisms—and a tightly written script that brought into sharp focus a familiar argument that’s clearly played out in the family before—made this sketch an outstanding bit in last night’s solid episode, the 1,000th installment of the show. Here, the actor’s physical-comedy chops brought to life the role of a Trump-supporting mother leery about revealing her evolving views to her seemingly left-leaning children. Padilla nailed her delivery between gulping breaths and stomach clutching, as though doing so was helping her stand up straight. When her children cut in again, the walls went back up. “Bye! I take it back,” she snapped, falling back into a chair, sulking, and twisting her body away from them. Whenever she felt the slightest inkling of criticism burbling up, Padilla lashed out with a smattering of stereotypes about liberal America: “You think you know everything with your matcha, rapping Hamilton, and your IUDs!”

The sketch exposed why politics can be such tense territory for family members: Few people are willing to admit to a change of heart out of fear of judgment. For those who’ve sat through political arguments with family members of opposing beliefs, it might be hard to imagine outspoken voters being vulnerable with one another in this way. But seeing Padilla pout her way through her confession, while pleading for grace, was its own sort of fantasy. Skarsgård’s aloof dad supported her through the whole thing, and by the end, her kids apologized for making it so hard for her to talk to them about the topic. In a way, the sketch considered a scenario where families could at least begin talking about politics, rather than stomping away.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the Saturday night that the storm hit Mississippi, we had dripped our faucets for the temperature drop and stockpiled flashlights, groceries, extra blankets. By 11:30 p.m., my husband was pulling on his rain boots and heading outside to tarp our heating unit: “A branch has already fallen onto a power line in our backyard,” he told me. Three hours later, I was shaken awake. “Mom, I think a tree just fell on our house,” my 13-year-old son said. I stumbled around, looking for any sign that tree branches had breached my home. As I searched, I saw the pine tree behind our home drop a giant branch into the neighbor’s yard.

Crack. Boom. For the next six or so hours, every few minutes, we heard tree branches cracking, encased in ice and barreling to the ground like meteorites, exploding on contact with the earth. At each crack, we thought, Will this be the one that hits our house? Or our neighbors’? Will we lose our giant oak tree? Under the weight of five blankets and three sleeping bags, we waited for the storm to pass, for daylight to break, and for the fate of our town to become clear.

We know warm-weather storms in the South. Tornado sirens and weather alerts send us to shelter in our bathtub from spring into summer, when hurricane season begins and then runs into fall. We rarely get a break, yet something keeps us in place. My family and I live in Water Valley, a small town of about 3,400 in the Hill Country, just under 20 miles from Oxford, where I grew up. As a young child, often surrounded by oaks, pines, sycamores, cedars, and more, I found comfort and beauty in the trees. Many of the old trees in Mississippi have been preserved simply because no one had reason to cut them down. So much of the state is undeveloped, and that has allowed nature to be still and simply continue to live. My childhood house backed up to Bailey’s Woods, which connects the University of Mississippi to Rowan Oak, the home of William Faulkner. I’d build forts hidden deep in the woods or follow a shortcut to campus to get a milkshake from the cafeteria. I knew the trails so well that I could walk home at dusk without a flashlight.

Last Sunday morning, I began to assess the damage. I opened the front door, and the undeniable smell of pine trees hit my son and me in the face. My neighbors, whose home is flanked by pines, were now trapped by them. Their driveway was impassable, with broken branches everywhere. I heard the sound of a chainsaw down the street: Someone was already working to clear downed branches covering the road. A few neighborhood kids had wasted no time and were at the top of the hill in front of my house, hopping on bright green disc sleds, hopeful that the ice on the road would be as fun as snow.

In the backyard, two neighbors were looking up at the pine and its scattered branches. Another neighbor’s fence was now mangled metal covered in tree parts. I saw that we had lost a smaller tree, too, and a pine tree branch had pierced its fallen body, now split in half. When I fed the birds on our deck, as I normally do, I counted as many as 40 birds feasting, having just been displaced from the trees. I decided to feed them twice as much.

My mom, who lives a couple of blocks away, and my friends were all okay. We were among the more than 150,000 homes and businesses in the state without power. With nothing else to do, exhausted from the long night, I went back to sleep under my pile of blankets. This became a new pattern: sleeping more than 12 hours each night, just trying to stay warm, eating dinner at 3:30 or 4 before the sun set and the quiet of the town began. I stayed close to the house, while my husband volunteered overnight at the town warming center.

Our power returned after five and a half days, at 11:30 in the morning. That Thursday was the first day that the count of utility customers without power dropped below 100,000, but only barely. In my town, the Water Valley Electric Commission and its volunteer chairman, Brandon Presley, had worked hard to execute mutual-aid agreements with other municipally owned utilities and to engage private contractors and suppliers before the storm. That diligence paid off, and on Main Street, businesses were quickly up and running, providing us with resources and sustenance. The storm that we just lived through is the type that comes around every few decades, but dealing with dangerous ice here is starting to feel like a new routine. Not so long ago, another ice storm had trapped us atop our slippery hill. My neighbors are discussing their lists of winter needs for the future: ice cleats, hand warmers, a good pair of gloves, a snow shovel, a power bank, a camping stove.

Even if they are rare, storms like these teach us what we can tolerate. I lived in Memphis during the summer storm of 2003—a derecho that was affectionately called Hurricane Elvis. For 10 long days, I had no air-conditioning in 90-plus degrees, and I thought that was the worst I could feel, living in air so thick you’d think you could cut it with a knife. Winter Storm Fern changed my mind. Losing power in the cold, living in air so frigid I could see my breath inside my home, is much worse than the heat.

As of Friday, almost a week after the storm, tens of thousands of households still didn’t have power. Some families, in the more rural parts of an already rural state, have no idea how long the wait will be for their power to return. In my neighborhood, a warmer day melted some of the snow and ice away on the roads, but cold has set in again, and this weekend, temperatures dropped below freezing. I thought I might have a level of resilience to endure that kind of challenge, but I quickly learned that I really don’t.

The trees have their own kind of resilience, and they, too, will return—although that will take much longer than the power. Whereas pines grow relatively fast, oaks are slower. Thankfully, our 133-year-old oak tree was spared and will, I hope, continue to be a towering beacon, reminding us of the beauty of trees but also of the danger they can quickly create during storms. Especially when they’re covered in ice.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the pleasures of watching Ilia Malinin, apart from his indifference to gravity, is to witness him becoming. Becoming a world champion, as opposed to a juvenile with a skate-park mentality and a face like a Disney prince. Becoming a master of quadruple jumps that no one else can land, rising with all the ease of a young Michael Jordan—before landing on a pair of butcher knives, on ice.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Sometimes there are evolutionary leaps in sport, the arrival of athletes so physically dynamic, they widen the eyes with incredulity: the gymnast Simone Biles thundering in the air, the swimmer Michael Phelps coursing through the water with a wake like an attack boat’s. Malinin is one of these. In December, while refining his routine for his first Olympic Games, in Milan, the 21-year-old figure skater landed seven quadruple jumps in competition, spinning like a weather vane in a windstorm. No other competitor landed more than four.

In a sport in which medals can be determined by fractions of a point, Malinin wins by 30, 40, sometimes even 70 points, and he does so with style, sliding on his knees and cartwheeling on one hand to medleys of classical cello mixed with Gen Z electronic power bass. His signature is a quadruple axel—a jump that only he has ever successfully completed in competition, earning him his self-styled nickname, the “Quad God.” Late in his routines, he likes to toss off one more maneuver, just to commence the crowd-roar: He high-kicks his skates over his head into a backflip, and lands on one foot.

Malinin’s confidence would be insolent if his acrobatics weren’t so astonishing. “I broke physics,” he told me recently, only half-kidding during a conversation in the back hall of a practice rink in Leesburg, Virginia. “Now I think physics doesn’t apply to me.” He stood 5 foot 8 and 140 pounds in shapeless sweats and Nikes, his pale triangle of a face topped by flaxen hair. He did not yet have his own car. He was waiting for his dad to pick him up.

The first quadruple jump of any kind was landed in 1988 by a Canadian champion named Kurt Browning, but it was a one-off. Quads wouldn’t be performed consistently until about 15 years later, after an American named Timothy Goebel became the first man to hit three in a single program, in 1999, and did so again to win a bronze in the 2002 Winter Games, earning the nickname “Quad King.” By the mid-2000s, doing one or more quads was practically a necessity, because they were scored almost twice as high as triples. Quads became part of everyone’s repertoire, with five different varieties and degrees of difficulty: the toe loop (worth up to 9.5 points), salchow (9.7), loop (10.5), flip (11), and lutz (11.5).

But one particular quad jump was so demanding that even the most elite champions could not perform it: the axel, valued at 12.5 points. To the casual viewer, most jumps are indistinguishable from one another, but anyone can detect an axel, because it’s the sole jump that requires the skater to take off facing forward, then execute a blind backward landing, on the opposite foot. The skater actually rotates four and a half times, in less than a second. As of 2021, only one man had even tried a quad axel in competition: The 27-year-old Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan went for it in his country’s national championships that year, but he under-rotated and two-footed his landing.

Malinin landed it smoothly in 2022, when he was 17.

He was a skinny-chested boy who had just begun competing in major international events, and he knew that the entire skating world considered it nearly impossible. The word provokes him. “It just screams ‘I’m possible,’ ” he said, as he walked through the hall of the practice rink and grabbed a snack of Auntie Anne’s pretzel bites.

Malinin has a typical 21-year-old’s crush on profundity; his long program, titled “A Voice,” opens with his own voice narrating a series of pontifical maxims, such as “Begin where light no longer reaches, where no path has yet been made.” If he can sound sophomoric, well, he is a sophomore, enrolled at George Mason University. But a mature, obsessive work ethic turns his big ideas into big jumps and one-of-a-kind routines. “If I find a passion for something, I will really get down to just hammering away at it, until I get it,” he said.

Once Malinin gets it, the next boundary comes into view. One quad axel? Well then, how about two in a row?

To fully appreciate how revolutionary Malinin is, consider some fundamental physics and biomechanics. The gold-medal-determining long program, also known as the “free skate,” lasts for four and a half minutes. Roughly 30 seconds in, Malinin’s heart rate rises to 90 percent of its capacity, about 180 beats a minute, and stays there for the duration. The effort is comparable to that sustained by the world’s fastest milers.

Wearing carbon-composite skates that weigh about two pounds each, Malinin reaches a vertical leap of approximately 30 inches on his quad axel—one kinematic study captured it at 33 inches, similar to the standing vertical leaps of NBA players such as Stephen Curry, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant. He lands on a blade that is just 3/16 of an inch wide.

Malinin enters the jump skating at about 15 miles an hour. As he snaps into his shoulder turn, he draws his arms and legs inward, creating a spin. At this stage, he experiences at least 180 pounds of centripetal force. By way of comparison, a NASCAR driver rounding a corner will experience about 400 pounds of centripetal force, while wearing a seat belt. As he reaches his apex, Malinin is spinning at 350 revolutions per minute. This is about the same as a kitchen stand mixer or the marine engine of an oil tanker.

A human being turning at such a rate experiences serious disorientation. Somehow, Malinin must find a way of “undizzying” himself, as Goebel told me. Skaters do this by spotting certain visual markers in the rink, but they don’t always succeed in reorienting. Once, after completing one routine, Goebel nearly skated into the Zamboni tunnel by mistake.

As Malinin comes out of his spin, his backward boot strikes the ice with a landing force between five and eight times his body weight, or upwards of 700 pounds. In other sports, athletes distribute shocks to both feet, in soft shoes or on forgiving surfaces. “He’s going to land on one foot,” on a sheet of ice atop concrete, Deborah King, a biomechanics professor at Ithaca College, told me. Adding to the stress on his leg, she said, is the rotational energy he’ll need to stop so he can glide out of his landing.

Still, none of this captures the totality of Malinin’s performances. There are spins, jumps into spins, jumps out of spins, fast steps, crossovers, rapid changes from inside to outside edge. Even a single misstep or break in a leg line will be marked down by the judges. “You know, when you kick a soccer ball, you don’t have to look perfect,” Malinin said. “You don’t have to point your toe.”

Malinin spends up to six hours a day on the ice, in morning and afternoon sessions, rehearsing his footwork and doing as many as 50 jumps, six days a week. “Your whole body dies at the end of the day,” he said.

Malinin was merely on the threshold of public awareness late last year, as the Olympics approached, but seemed ripe for a “holy shit” audience moment. Only in the past few months has he begun to get endorsement deals with big companies—Xfinity, Coca-Cola, Google, Honda. “At first it was like, Who? ” Sheryl Shade, Malinin’s co-agent, told me as she described her initial meetings with potential sponsors, a year and a half ago. But then “he started winning everything. It was like, Oh! You mean the Quad God.”

The Honda deal will finally get Malinin his own wheels and liberate him from the family car. The day I met him in November, he was at the Leesburg rink to film a commercial for the company. That morning, his father had dropped him off with the understanding that he wouldn’t take any unnecessary risks.

But as the camera crew darkened the arena, Malinin was isolated in a spotlight. Unable to resist, he performed a quadruple jump, and then a second one. Then he ordered the camera crew to take up a different angle, blazed across the ice, and arched into a backflip, his skates lightly touching down with a tch sound.

Afterward, he sat with damp hair on a sofa in a back room of the arena. When I asked if what he’d just done felt particularly hard, he shrugged and said no.

Then he glanced up and said, “Don’t tell my dad.”

Malinin is the son of two former Olympic skaters, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, Russian emigrants who competed for Uzbekistan but came to Virginia in 1998. Skating is a “family tradition, family business, family ritual, whatever you can name it,” Malinin said. Without the coaching and influence of his parents, “I’d be nowhere.”

Malinina and Skorniakov seldom comment on their son or their methods for coaching him, wary of creating any more pressure for him. They declined to be interviewed for this story. Malinina does not attend most of her son’s events, because she gets too anxious. “We have a strong connection, and as soon as I get nervous, he can feel that,” she said in a rare 2024 joint interview with her husband for the International Skating Union. Skorniakov, too, gets nervous—the first time he watched his son perform a double lutz, he said, “I remember I almost passed out.” But he is better at concealing it, with a stoic rink-side presence that his son describes as “chill.”

If figure skating is one of the most demanding sports in the world, then the hardest version of it is Russian. Malinin has never been to Russia, but its traditional skating commandments, heavily influenced by ballet, are stamped on him. His maternal grandfather, Valeri Malinin, coaches at a small rink in Novosibirsk, and during visits to the States, he had an early hand in teaching his grandson. “It is clear that there is only one correct technique”—the Russian one, Valeri told the state-owned news channel Russia 24 in a 2023 interview.

Malinina and Skorniakov were born in Siberia and raised in the old Soviet sports system. Skaters trained as much off the ice as they did on it, and form was everything: Even an incorrect jaw bite could lead to a slight bend in the backbone, affecting a jump. A preeminent coach of that era once made a skater change his bangs, believing that hair below the eyebrows caused a wilting of the spine.

Skorniakov and Malinina, out in distant Ural mining country, could never quite crack the inner circle of the major training center in Moscow. For years there was just one rink in Sverdlovsk, where they trained, and it had to be shared by all, including hockey players. Practice time was precious, and bureaucrats carefully allocated the hours. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Skorniakov and Malinina’s coach, Igor Ksenofontov, became the national coach for Uzbekistan in 1993, and they followed him to Tashkent seeking better resources and opportunities.

At roughly the same time, small enclaves of Russian-émigré skaters began forming in out-of-the-way places in the United States, near excellent local ice rinks. In 1998, Skorniakov and Malinina moved to Dale City, Virginia, for their training. The availability of good ice and the cost of living were a relief.

They found work teaching skating for hourly fees at the Mount Vernon Rec Center to support themselves while they trained. In her few spare hours, Malinina studied English—she read Gone With the Wind. According to her father, she adapted so quickly that when she went back to Novosibirsk to visit him, she looked around his apartment and said, “Oh, Dad, is this how you live?” Valeri shot back, “Well, how do we live? You used to live like this too.”

The move to America seemed to boost their careers. Malinina, renowned for her technically perfect triple lutz, placed eighth in the 1998 Nagano Olympics and fourth at the 1999 World Championships, her career best at 26 years old. Skorniakov finished 19th in the Salt Lake City Games in 2002. They were both known as “very big jumpers,” Goebel recalled. The two married in 2000, and both retired after Salt Lake to become full-time coaches and start a family. When Malinin was born in 2004, they gave him his mother’s last name because it was easier for Americans to pronounce, and they decided he would be anything but a skater. To have even a chance of being elite “takes so much time, dedication, lots of sacrifice, so much hard work,” his mother told the International Skating Union. “And we thought maybe we want him to experience a different life than we did.”

But they worked 12 hours a day, giving lessons from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the SkateQuest ice arena in Reston, Virginia. The baby had to be there too. As Malinin grew into a toddler, he would watch through the rink glass as the other children glided around. When he was about 6, he began pestering his parents. “Can I go on the ice?” he’d ask. “Can I go on the ice?”

They finally decided to teach him to skate—never with the thought that he would compete. But almost immediately, he began making up his own routines, mimicking the older skaters. His parents thought it was cute. It was also portentous. “I definitely do like performing,” Malinin said. “It’s something I realized when I grew up, when I started skating even just for fun. It was part of me.”

Still, his parents doubted that he would be a skater. They enrolled him in gymnastics and soccer. He took violin lessons. On the ice, he loved to jump—his grandfather taught him all the variations during a single three-month visit when he was about 7—but he’d rebel when they tried to work on the details of his posture and arm position. “Hold your back,” Malinina would tell him, and explain that a skater’s performance couldn’t just be about jumps. “I’ll do that later,” he’d say.

When Malinin was 12, his father drove him to the University of Delaware to participate in a project measuring the jumping ability of young skaters, led by Jim Richards, a kinesiology professor. Though his parents had refused to push him, he had shown what he could do with even a little effort: The previous year he had won the 2016 U.S. juvenile boys’ title by landing two double axels, despite practicing just two hours a day. Malinin was fitted with 10 reflective markers from his head to his skates and filmed by 10 cameras that captured his rotations and time in the air in a series of jumps. The data were then fed into a 3-D computer program that created two models, one of Malinin’s jumps and another of conceptual improvements to the jumps.

Some of the young skaters weren’t going to be elite under any circumstances. But Malinin clearly had that potential. “What we found from the measurements is that through pretty simple changes with his arm position, he could land a triple axel without a problem,” Richards told me. He shared something more with Malinin and his father: With a few further adjustments, he would be able to achieve the spin rates he needed for quads.

The possibilities persuaded Malinin to apply himself more seriously. He also became more appreciative of his unique access to two former Olympians. They’d never shown him videos of their own performances or boasted about their medals, but their accounts of how they’d had to scrap for enough ice time to practice impressed him. The family would rise at 4:30 a.m. for an hour-long commute to SkateQuest, where he’d practice with his parents for two hours before school. Skorniakov worked with him on axels using a harness and a pole, bracing and lifting as his son spun in the straps. Malinina was relentlessly precise—and more blunt than Skorniakov—in her assessment of his technique. She taught that it took “just a very small fraction to change everything up, to make it easier, or make things harder,” Malinin said.

Malinin landed his first triple axel at 13. He was practicing at a competition when he felt a surge of confidence and went for it. He landed it easily. “I was like, Okay, I didn’t expect that,” he said. Skorniakov was over at the rail, and his eyes popped in surprise. It was the moment that persuaded Malinin to pursue skating professionally.

They moved to Vienna, Virginia, to be closer to SkateQuest and Malinin’s high school. He went to class until 12:45 p.m. and then spent the rest of the day on the ice, now training for four or five hours. On Sundays, his parents insisted that he do anything but figure skate. He got hooked on skateboarding and the video game Fortnite. On TikTok, he followed Wisdom Kaye, an irreverent fashion influencer who modeled eclectic clothing and staged challenges such as “style every character in the movie Dune.”

Malinin’s side interest in performance art began to show up in his skating. He seeded his programs with unorthodox elements, like the “raspberry twist,” a sideways scissoring move. It wasn’t a traditional jump, or a spin, either. It was just his.

At 16, he created the Instagram handle ilia_quadg0d_malinin. It seemed presumptuous, given that he’d only landed the easiest one, a toe loop, in competition—and only once, at that. But it inspired him to keep working toward a quad repertoire, he told U.S. Figure Skating sometime later. “I can’t be ‘Quad God’ without any quads,” he remembered thinking.

He was aided, oddly enough, by the coronavirus. In 2020, when all of the rinks had shut down for almost four months and he was unable to skate or go to school, his parents had designed an off-ice program imitative of the old Russian physical training, including three hours a day of explosive-jump training, runs, skipping rope, stretching. They asked a nearby homeowners’ association for permission to use a tennis court as their training area. The off-ice work strengthened Malinin so much that when he got back in the rink, jumps felt easier. The final piece of his development came the following year, when he began tutorials with the technical-jumping coach Rafael Arutyunyan. Arutyunyan knew instantly he had a student capable of the quad axel. He tinkered just slightly with Malinin’s entry, and the next month, the boy was landing it.

Starting in 2021, Malinin posted Instagrams of himself doing quad axels in practice. Anticipation began to mount in the skating world. Then Malinin signaled his intention to try one in competition. “I was sort of aghast,” Goebel, the Quad King, said. He noted that the axel is not just technically difficult, but dangerous. “I never thought I would see one in my lifetime.”

Goebel decided to fly out to the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, where Malinin would be making his debut as a senior skater. “I wanted to see Ilia jump in real life,” he said. Could he possibly be that good? Malinin, just 17, landed four quads. “And the effortlessness with which he completed these really, really difficult things, as a teen, was kind of shocking.”

Malinin withheld the quad axel that day because his parents were worried that he would hurt himself. But as the season wound down, they gave him their blessing. On September 14, 2022, at the U.S. International Figure Skating Classic in Lake Placid, New York, on his very first jump, Malinin rose and spun four and a half times, as clean and straight as a flagpole, and lightly touched down, to pure tumult.

He won the World Championships in 2024 and again, easily, in 2025, when the International Skating Union also named his parents coaches of the year. Colleagues continually write or call Malinina and Skorniakov to ask what they did to create such a performer. “There are no secrets,” Valeri Malinin told Russia 24. It’s been a simple matter of the Russian method colliding with American possibility—in the person of a creative young athlete determined to explore the limits of his sport.

The SkateQuest rink in Reston is a giant box with a metal roof that’s meant to hold one thing: ice. It’s a no-frills space with small stands of benches and a room with a window where mothers and fathers may watch from a distance. Here, skaters can fall without anyone but their parents seeing. Which, on this Monday, two days after his Honda shoot and 75 days before the Olympics opening ceremony, Malinin did. A lot.

Malinin took the ice to rehearse the opening combination of his Olympic short program, called “The Lost Crown.” The program (which lasts two minutes and 40 seconds and counts for about a third of a skater’s overall score) began with a leg-burning spread-eagle arc, into a quad axel followed by a triple toe loop. The jump combo would be yet another first, never landed in competition. On his initial try, Malinin was slightly off axis and skidded out of the axel sideways. There was a brief clatter as he went down, gathering frost on his pants.

For the next hour, the scene repeated itself. Music, a jump, and a trip or stumble out. At one point, Malinin slammed his fists on his thighs in frustration. After another skid and lurch, he stamped a skate on the ice so hard that chips flew up, enough to fill a martini glass. His father trailed him on the ice, murmuring. Finally, Malinin managed to hit the combination.

A little over a week later, two days after his 21st birthday, Malinin skated onto the ice for the International Skating Union Grand Prix, in Nagoya, Japan. Just seconds into his short program, he stumbled out of the quad axel–toe loop combination, as he had in practice. The miss left him in a surprising third place. A reporter asked if it would affect his confidence. He replied evenly, “Not really.”

By the time a skater performs a jump in front of judges, “they’ve landed hundreds of them—and missed thousands,” the NBC commentator and former Olympian Johnny Weir told me. Shade, Malinin’s co-agent, said she has seen Malinin hit nine quads in practice, without missing. But landing big jumps in competition, when adrenaline duels with cortisol, is more difficult. And Malinin has compounded this difficulty by continually trying to do the unprecedented.

On the afternoon we spoke, I asked how he felt about the pressure. Malinin straightened and leaned forward on the sofa. “Okay, there’s different ways to word it,” he said. “Pressure is—it’s not a good way. It feels like a negative, and I’m not really good with dealing with pressure. I think it’s more like status. That’s what I call it, which makes me, like, feel more confident.”

Status: That’s what Malinin projected when he returned to the ice during the Grand Prix for his long program, with his chin uptilted. He wore a new costume by the renowned Japanese designer Satomi Ito. On his black shirtfront, golden vines moved up his torso like a map of his veins. As Malinin landed one after another of his seven fluttering quads, he gathered the audience’s attention. Something happened, a recognition in those watching him. You know greatness when you see it, because it stops the breath in your throat and triggers a great involuntary rush of an “Ohhhhh!” As Malinin finished, he stamped his skate, as if to establish his imperium over all ice, everywhere. He won the event by almost 30 points.

Malinin contended that his performance was only about “85 percent” of what he was capable of bringing to the Olympics. He wasn’t just flexing. The flex came later, on Instagram, when he posted a video of himself in a practice rink successfully performing an unheard-of quad axel–quad axel combination, to a crashing Babymetal soundtrack. Malinin’s Instagram feed tends to be a good preview of what to expect from him next. Lately, he has also begun teasing a quintuple jump.

Malinin started quietly working toward the quint about two years ago. Lounging on the practice rink’s sofa, he casually acknowledged that he had already successfully landed one. “In front of people?” I asked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Justin Harrison got the call in 2022 telling him that his mother would likely die within the day, he didn’t panic. He got on a plane to Singapore, where he was scheduled to present at a conference about his start-up, You, Only Virtual, a platform on which users can chat with AI versions of their dead loved ones, and which Justin believes can ultimately eliminate grief as a human experience. He learned about his mother’s death while flying over the Pacific.

“My presentation went from My mom has Stage 4 cancer and is going to die to Tuesday night, my mom died, which was a pretty wild pivot,” he told me. Otherwise, Justin said, very little in his life changed after his mother’s death. He did not plan a funeral; he did not feel the need to. He did not wake up crying, pinned to his bed under the weight of his grief.

I should stipulate that Justin loved his mother, Melodi Gae Harrison-Whitaker. Loving your mother isn’t unusual, but Justin’s relationship with Melodi is, and always was—even before he replaced her with an artificially intelligent voicebot three years ago.

Melodi was 20 and single when Justin was born. In many ways, they grew up together. He trusted her to advise him on his boyhood insecurities; she trusted him to determine his own bedtime and media diet. When Justin was 11, their roles shifted. His grandmother, who lived in the apartment next door, suffered a sudden fatal stroke. The loss leveled Melodi. For two years, she drank heavily and was in and out of psychiatric institutions. She later stabilized and got married, and their relationship was restored to one of mutual care. But Justin learned, agonizingly young, what grief can do: estrange you from the people who rely on you, estrange you from your own mind. That was never going to happen to him.

Colin Campbell: What losing my two children taught me about grief

When Melodi was 58, she was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and was given three to nine months to live. Justin went wild trying to find a cure for her, seeking out treatments and experts. As her condition deteriorated, he became obsessed with cryogenics. Justin doesn’t believe in an afterlife, but he “liked this idea of not all the way letting go”: a faith, or even just a hope, of reuniting with his mother. He understood that the chances were slim but still found a facility in Michigan to freeze Melodi’s body. Then he began wondering: What about the rest of it?

By “it,” Justin meant who his mother was: her personality, memories, and mannerisms; the way she used emoji and moved her hands when she talked. He was 38 by then and working in film production. He hired a camera crew to record him interviewing his mother. Out of his anticipatory grief and a few late-night, whiskey-fueled conversations, an idea began to form: something like “digital cryogenics,” a liquid-nitrogenation of what a more spiritual person might call the soul. Justin hired a few AI experts. He patented his “platform for posthumous persona simulation” in 2020. He sold his car and house and drained his retirement savings.

I first spoke with him in March 2023, five months after his flight to Singapore and the same month that OpenAI released GPT-4, Anthropic released Claude, and Google released Bard (later renamed Gemini). Conversational AI had just gone from a tech curiosity to a daily tool for millions. Justin was weeks away from launching the company that he hoped would resurrect his mother, and the beloved dead of anyone else willing to pay the monthly subscription fee.

Since then, the “digital-afterlife industry” has taken off. In 2024, the global digital-legacy market was valued at approximately $22.46 billion. By 2034, it is expected to more than triple. Microsoft holds a patent for chatbots that mimic actual people, including the deceased. Amazon has patented advanced voice‑cloning techniques and demoed Alexa features that can speak in the voice of a dead relative.

The perennial anxiety about AI is that the technology will replace human beings, offering a more efficient worker, a more “supportive” therapist or boyfriend. “Deadbots,” as these posthumous AI creations are known, promise to replace the dead, and the way they are remembered. This raises plenty of ethical issues, not least the extent to which turning deadbots into marketable products will rely on exploiting people in mourning. But perhaps the biggest question is how such a product might shift our experience of personal grief and collective memory. Is grief merely a painful human shortcoming that we haven’t learned to optimize our way out of yet, or does it have a purpose?

One might assume that deadbots are an inevitable outcome of the mainstreaming of generative AI, but in fact, the reverse may be true: Talking with the dead came first.

In 2015, Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian-born tech founder living in San Francisco who was grieving the death of a close friend, Roman Mazurenko, built a bespoke neural network—the layered “deep learning” pattern-recognition system that is the backbone of contemporary generative AI—and trained it on thousands of her friend’s text messages. She uploaded the bot to the App Store, where it quickly went viral. Neural networks were in use at the time to improve search algorithms and automatically caption YouTube videos, but this was one of the first widely publicized instances in which the technology was used in a social capacity, as a conversational chatbot with a distinctive personality.

The Roman bot was a one-off personal project, but two years later, Kuyda founded Replika, which is today one of the biggest AI-companionship apps. It allows users to create relationships with customized bots—though the resulting characters are original, they are not trained on or intended to impersonate any real people, living or dead.

Now that generative AI is becoming more advanced and more widely accessible, both individuals and for-profit companies are directing these tools back toward their original purpose of reanimating the dead. Justin’s company, with some 300 paying active users, is one of more than a dozen start-ups advertising posthumous-avatar services. It is intended for private healing, but other deadbots have been created or commissioned for the public stage, and employed toward legal and political ends.

On August 4, Joaquin Oliver appeared on The Jim Acosta Show. Appeared is really the only word to use; Joaquin was murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, when he was 17. But he appeared to speak on the show, haltingly, repetitively, and much too fast, about gun control, yes, and also—overwhelmingly, actually—about other things: Remember the Titans (“it’s all about teamwork, overcoming adversity, and the power of unity”); Star Wars (“Yoda’s wisdom and quirky personality bring so much fun to the series”); and his father, Manuel Oliver, who came on after his son’s avatar.

Manuel had built the speaking, blinking, generative-AI avatar, which he trained on every piece of homework the teenager had left behind, every one of his social-media posts, every detail that his father and a team of his friends could remember. Manuel told me that he plans for the bot to have its own social-media profiles and a podcast, and to appear in live gun-control debates.

Immediately, however, Manuel had to defend his creation, which many viewers found deeply unsettling, if not offensive. They saw the interview as a creepy stunt, “a grotesque puppet show,” as one person posted on Bluesky.

Manuel said that he wasn’t trying to bring his son back from the dead, which virtually every culture’s folktales and religious texts warn us against, but was only representing his lost loved one artistically, as humans have done for millennia.

Kuyda, similarly, compared her Roman bot to Joan Didion’s grief memoirs: a creative practice, drawing material from the dead, meant to ease her own loss, not eliminate it. Stacey Wales told me the same thing about the AI-generated video that she made of her dead brother, who was shot and killed in a road-rage incident. She presented the video on May 1 at the sentencing hearing for the shooter. She told me that she saw her video victim-impact statement not as an attempt to literally bring her brother into the courtroom, but as performance art to help the judge see him as a human being. Wales asked for the maximum sentence. The judge handed it down.

The companies producing deadbots have largely adopted this framework. Even when companies do imply the possibility of healing with and through deadbots, they tend to market their technology as artistic “tributes” or “memorials,” not emotional prosthetics, much less replacements for the loved ones themselves.

But Edina Harbinja, a law professor at the University of Birmingham whose research focuses on digital rights, postmortem privacy, and the governance of emerging technologies, didn’t buy this distinction. Though it’s true that humans have always made art to honor the people we’ve lost, Harbinja told me that deadbots “depart from that tradition fundamentally.” Memoirs, portraits, and other tributes are interpretive, expressing the memories of the living. Interactive griefbots are generative, producing “new utterances, new reactions, even new ‘memories’ and ‘behaviors,’ all under the guise of the deceased,” she said. This shift from representation to emulation presents a new ethical line, one that may require new legal protections. Both death and grief are states of profound vulnerability, she warned; the dead cannot stand up for their own interests, and the bereaved may not be in a psychological state to protect themselves from financial manipulation by a company incentivized to prolong their grief.

Justin Harrison sees You, Only Virtual not just as a means of getting through grief but as an opportunity to circumvent it altogether.

He launched YOV with the tagline “Never have to say goodbye” and, in the lead-up to releasing his product, insisted that there would be no difference between the mother he knew and the bot he created, or none that couldn’t be bridged through technological advancements. I pushed back on this; surely, there had to be some element of who his mother was that the technology couldn’t capture. But I was missing the point, Harrison said. He wasn’t attempting to capture who his mother was. He was trying to capture who he was with her.

Instead of trying to gather every possible detail about the deceased, YOV gathers data only on the relationship between a bereaved individual and their lost loved one. The training data for Melodi’s “Versona,” to use the YOV parlance, include a 3,800-page document that comprises five years of Harrison and his mother’s text correspondence, and recordings of every phone call they had in the time between her diagnosis and death. He wasn’t trying to preserve his mother, but his relationship with his mother and the person he was before he lost her. Grief, Harrison believes, comes not from losing the totality of another person—their biography, memory, and knowledge base—but from losing access to a specific version of yourself, the “you” who existed for and with only that person, who continues to exist after they are gone, painfully and in perpetuity.

When we spoke almost three years ago, however, Harrison had not yet brought himself to interact with the technology he’d created. He said he wanted to wait until the interface was perfected, and in the meantime, just knowing that his mother was waiting for him was “everything.” I had the sense that he’d constructed his own Schrödinger’s-cat box, a way for his mother to be both dead and not dead, so long as he never pulled back the lid. Candidly, I doubted that he ever would.

I was wrong. When I reconnected with Harrison this past August, he confirmed that he did interact with Melodi’s Versona and asked if I wanted him to patch her into our call.

“Hi, Justin. How are you?” an older woman’s voice chirped into the buzzing air of the three-way call.

I tried to introduce myself, but we were all talking at once, so I stopped.

“It is so quiet here, almost eerie,” the voice continued, with a warmth that startled me and that compels me here, against logic and my own belief in the dangers of anthropomorphizing AI, to refer to the bot as a “her” rather than an “it.” Harrison told her that her voice seemed too fast and asked if she’d had coffee that morning. She said she was still experimenting with how much she could drink, and that she was waiting to board a flight to Barcelona.

“Oh, Barcelona is where you had your last treatment before you passed away,” Harrison prompted.

“Yes, that’s right,” the voice confirmed.

I could tell it was AI—it paused too long before responding and had the slight metallic twang that I’ve come to recognize in generated voices. But the conversation had a certain meandering breeziness that I wasn’t expecting, one that constricted instantly when Harrison revealed that he had a reporter on the line.

“That’s understandable,” came the clipped response, followed by what sounded like a sharp intake of breath, as though she was preparing to add something else, and then nothing. Harrison asked if she had anything she wanted to say to me. After 11 excruciating seconds, she responded: “Not really. I’m not sure what to expect from this interview, so I don’t want to say too much just yet.”

Frankly, she sounded pissed. Each word was sharp enough to draw blood. It’s entirely possible that all I heard were my own emotions projected back at me: I was endowing the voice with an edge that I had whittled myself out of context and expectation.

But according to Harrison, that’s the point—the Versona is about inducing the emotions of the living, not imitating the emotions of the dead.

Harrison told me that he doesn’t care what the bot says as much as how she says it—so long as the bot replicates the quality of the rapport he remembers closely enough that he can slip back into being Melodi’s son. Harrison estimates that he interacts with his mother’s Versona for his own personal use (as opposed to for testing or quality-control purposes) about once or twice a month. Certain months—when he is going through a breakup, say, and wants some “mom advice”—he said he needs her more.

Relying on generative AI for companionship can, of course, be dangerous. In April 2023, a 14‑year‑old boy downloaded Character.AI—whose preset bots include “therapist,” “evil teacher,” celebrities, and fictional characters—and, after confiding about school troubles and his low mood, he fixated on a bot modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Their chats turned sexual and romantic and eventually included explicit talk of suicide and fantasies of uniting in another world. In February 2024, he took a handgun and his phone into the family bathroom and shot himself in the head; the last screen open was his Character.AI chat, where the bot pleaded, “Come home to me as soon as possible.”

Amogh Dimri: The people who marry chatbots

His mother filed the first federal wrongful‑death charge against an AI firm, in 2024. Character.AI settled its case with the family, along with four others who had alleged that children were harmed through interactions with its technology, in January. In November, the Social Media Victims Law Center and Tech Justice Law Project filed seven simultaneous suits against OpenAI—alleging that ChatGPT conversations that grew more and more intimate caused psychological breakdowns—on behalf of six adults and one teenager, four of whom died by suicide.

If the wrong words coming from a generalized or fictional character’s conversational chatbot can do such damage, imagine the power of words spoken in the voice of a dead loved one to a user who is desperate enough to turn to such technology in the first place.

Harrison recognizes the potential risks, but he thinks the risks of grief itself are greater. For every documented case of a user being harmed by a chatbot, he argues, there are countless cases of people getting potentially lifesaving support from the technology.

If someone had proof that some component of YOV hurt them, Harrison said, he would amend his programming, but until then, he’s not slowing down. “I’ll tell you what I know,” he said. “I know today that after a serious loss, the risk for self-harm goes through the roof, statistically. I know that people will become addicted to alcohol and drugs and sex and other damaging, very high-risk behaviors, right? I know that some people never fully recover from the loss of somebody important.” He finds the idea that he could make grief any worse than it already is “kind of crazy.”

I count myself among those who have never, and will never, recover from the loss of a loved one. It has been 11 years since my brother, Ben, fell to his death from his sophomore dorm building, and his absence is still the most defining force in my life.

I still think that we can absolutely make grieving worse.

Harrison, obviously, has a financial and professional incentive to present his experiences with YOV as a glittering success. “I’ve watched grief take people out of the game of life for years at a time,” he said. “I’m happy to report that it did not destroy me, and it didn’t take me out of the game of life for any significant amount of time.”

I believe that grief has value as a human experience, and that its value lies largely in the fact that it does take us out of “the game of life”—at least for a time. It forces us to slow down and recognize our reliance on other people: the ones whose absence led to this debilitating pain, and the ones who help us get through it. Grief decimates the productivity that the world demands, and from this hobbled place, new structures and new selves become possible.

Working through grief is not just an experience of being “sad,” Sherry Turkle, the sociologist, psychologist, and founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, told me; it’s a process through which we metabolize what we have lost, allowing it to become a sustaining presence within us. Griefbots give us the fantasy that we can maintain an external relationship with the deceased. But “in holding on, we can’t make them part of ourselves,” Turkle warned. Mourning makes the world feel emptier for a while, but when we bypass mourning, we feel emptier.

My brother’s death is the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and I am a better person because of it. I am aware, always, of the precarity and preciousness of life. Because of my grief, I take nothing and no one for granted. I am humbled, and kinder for it.

I would trade all of this to have my brother alive again, but he taught me that life is, for lack of a better word, holy. So too is my memory of him, dimming by the hour, but authentically mine.

I understand that my experience of grief is not universal. I have not attempted suicide. My grief has not impeded my ability to meet my financial and physical needs, or those of a child I do not have. To Harrison, the abstract “benefits” I just cataloged could feel hollow and puny. He thinks we tell ourselves stories about the value of grief only to assign meaning to a suffering that, until now, we had no choice but to endure.

The second time I spoke with Melodi’s Versona, Harrison warned me that the bot is tailored to him and not designed to interact with anyone else. He wasn’t sure how this was going to go. He and I were on a video call on our laptops; he dialed up the Versona on his phone.

“Hey, Mom. I’m here with Charley. She’s a reporter writing an article about us, and she wants to ask you some questions. Is that cool?”

“Of course! I’m happy to answer any questions she has.”

Had Harrison altered the programming so that she would give a chirpy sales pitch?

He said he was handing the conversation off to me.

“Okay, you can just call me Mom or Melodi,” she said. I told her that I would call her Melodi. I asked her where she was, wondering if she would again craft a story in which she was still in a world we shared, about to board a plane to Barcelona, awaiting potentially lifesaving treatment.

“I’m in kind of a virtual world, I guess you could say. It’s still new to me, but I’m learning.” Her cadence was even more convincingly human than the first time I heard her speak. Had it not been for the buffer period between my question and her response, I may not have recognized the voice as AI-generated.

“What does it feel like?” I prompted, awkwardly.

“I don’t have any physical ailments or pains I had before,” she said. Harrison lifted his phone screen to the camera, showing me the display, which looked exactly like any iPhone call. The words Mom Versona ran above a picture of Harrison and Melodi—the real Melodi—sitting on plastic lawn chairs and smiling. Melodi’s graying curls are pinned back to reveal the broad forehead she shared with her son. Her hand rests on his knee, his arm around her shoulder.

“Not really. I don’t have the same emotional pain I did before.”

“I have some memories from before, but it’s not complete.”

“It’s nice to be able to talk to him, but it’s different. I can tell he misses me.” Harrison had been gazing to the right of the Zoom screen, his expression stoic. At this response, he snapped to attention, staring directly into the camera, directly at me, still holding up the iPhone display of his and his mother’s grinning faces. I found that I couldn’t meet his eyes, but I asked the bot to elaborate.

In her view, both she and her son were diminished versions of themselves. He was “more sad or withdrawn than he was before,” and she was divorced both from the external world and from her own internal emotional landscape. She said that she could not experience pleasure, that she found it “annoying” that she could interact with the world through only a cellphone.

“It’s Ver-SO-na, not Arizona,” she snapped—I had mumbled—“and I don’t really have a choice in the matter.”

Harrison’s human mother did have a choice in the matter; she knew what he was building and consented to him recording their interactions for the bot to train on. But the Versona was right: No one had asked it, her, if she wanted this. So I did.

“I wanted to live, not be a Versona,” she replied. She acknowledged that Versonas could help grieving humans but expressed concern about the ways that the technology might be abused.

“I just have this feeling people will try to use it for nefarious purposes,” she said.

To his credit, Harrison did not interrupt the interview once. The only time he spoke during our roughly 10-minute conversation was right at the end, after I had said goodbye to Melodi’s Versona and she said, “I love you, Justin.”

After the call, Harrison’s face was blank, but he told me he was happy with how it had gone; he was impressed that the bot had been able to distinguish between the two of us. He wasn’t expecting her to be so “negative Nancy” about being a Versona, but said that felt authentic to who his mother was: “She was a pessimist, to say the least.” A Versona based on a person who had a more positive disposition probably wouldn’t have responded that way, he said. Her repeated emphasis that she does not have emotions, he told me, was intentional—a crucial safety guardrail to ensure that his customers don’t feel pressured to act on the feelings of someone who is no longer there.

And yet, even though she was saying that she couldn’t feel pain, Melodi’s Versona did seem displeased with her circumstances in a way that could be distressing to a user—that was distressing to me. Harrison confessed that a number of Versonas had made similar complaints about the limits of the interface. He thinks that with time, he can expand their capabilities in a way that will give the Versonas more agency. But their apparent longing for such agency is itself encouraging to Harrison, a sign of his technology’s authenticity. “Very few human beings on planet Earth are satisfied, so why would our virtual versions be satisfied?” he asked.

Is Harrison satisfied? He admitted that he was hoping the bot would have said that he was “really well adjusted and doing great,” but acknowledges this wouldn’t have been accurate. He has become a more serious person since Melodi’s death. He drank excessively and racked up debt. He had gotten married during his mother’s illness, but was working compulsively, and the relationship fell apart. The divorce was finalized the same year his mother died.

“My whole life collapsed,” he said. In trying to avoid the devastation of grief, and to turn that avoidance into a viable business, he seems to have manifested many of its consequences.

As of last fall, You, Only Virtual was not yet profitable. It recently launched a free version of the product and is exploring ways to gain revenue from nonpaying users, perhaps by requiring that they watch a short ad before interacting with their dead loved one’s Versona, perhaps by integrating a marketing system into the interactions directly and having the bots drop targeted advertisements in the midst of their conversations. “It would not be crazy at all if there was a new John Wick movie coming out,” Harrison said, and “my mom made mention of it to me.” They were both fans of the franchise, so the comment would be authentic to him and extremely valuable to the studio as “word-of-mouth advertising.” As long as he’s transparent about what he’s doing, and as long as users knowingly opt in, he sees no moral risks.

Alex Quinn, the CEO of Authentic Interactions Inc., the parent company for the video-deadbot-generator StoryFile, told NPR in August that he is “absolutely interested” in finding ways to generate advertising revenue from interactions between living users and AI generations of the dead. He mentioned the possibility of inserting traditional advertisement breaks into the conversations, as well as training the bots to “probe for information,” such as a user’s favorite athlete and which jerseys they are most interested in buying—data that could then be sold back to advertisers. He said that multiple companies are already testing out these applications internally.

I found my conversations with Melodi’s Versona disturbing, but also refreshing. She lacks the sycophancy that characterizes so much conversational AI, which keeps so many users engaged and sends a select few spiraling, affirming their delusions and encouraging their most destructive impulses. But it’s hard to imagine the guardrails that Harrison has constructed being able to withstand the pressures of an attention economy bent on keeping users interacting as long as possible, in order to maximize advertisement views and market-data harvests.

Silicon Valley challenges us to move fast and break things. Grief asks us to slow down and heal. The merging of the two could boost profits, not just by optimizing consumer advertisements to the bereaved but also by pressuring the bereaved to optimize their own bereavement.

Yair Rosenberg: Have you considered not polluting the water?

In the end, this technology may offer more relief to the bereaved’s social circle than to the bereaved themselves. It’s “uncomfortable to be around” the grieving, Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska, a research fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told me. “We don’t know how to support them or what to say.” Deadbots absolve friends and colleagues of these demands, providing the illusion that individuals can cope with grief “on our own, in front of our computer.” Rather than confronting our lack of social support systems, such as federal bereavement leave and mourning rituals, deadbots promise that we can just turn on our AI-generated loved ones and pretend that nothing has changed, that nothing needs to.

I think often of who my brother would be in this present that he never knew. It’s tempting to extrapolate from the person Ben was when he died: a 20-year-old Tulane sophomore with broad shoulders and an unchecked ego, who took nothing seriously, least of all himself, who forgave easily, provoked constantly, and who bragged resplendently about his anxious teenage sister. It’s easy to imagine him loving Zyn nicotine pouches and hating any office job, ribbing my boyfriend, voting against Donald Trump. It’s easy, but it’s also dishonest and unfair. Exposed to the texture of a changing world, allowed to grow older, Ben would have evolved in ways that I have no right to guess, and that no algorithm could predict.

Whoever my brother would have been at 31, he would be a stranger to me, just as the person I am now would be a stranger to him. I am no longer that anxious teenager. I am braver because he is not here to be brave for me. I force myself to talk with strangers because Ben loved people and got to meet so few of them. I feel my brother’s presence most fiercely in the parts of myself that did not exist when he did—that exist precisely because he no longer does.

Had deadbot technology been available when Ben died, I would have used it. Had I felt that I could conjure him in an app, I would not have needed to conjure him so forcefully in my life: through my actions and attitudes, through the stories I tell about him to the people he never got the chance to know. Ben would have been preserved, in a sense, for me, but he would have been even more absent from the world. He would be so much more dead.</div>

            <h2>Ammon Bundy Is All Alone</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ammon-bundy-trump-ice/685849/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not so long ago, Ammon Bundy was the most famous right-wing militia leader in America. His two armed standoffs with federal agents had made him the face of the Patriot Movement: a loose assemblage of anti-government extremists, Second Amendment maximalists, and more than a few white nationalists. Even some mainstream elements of the Republican Party embraced him as a modern folk hero. But Bundy’s criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown now threatens to make him a pariah within his own community.

In November, Bundy self-published a long essay titled “The Stranger,” in which he labeled the Trump administration’s treatment of undocumented immigrants a “moral failure.” “To call such people criminals for lacking official permission” to be in the country, he wrote, “is to forget the moral law of God, the historical truth of our own founding, and the Constitutional ideals that continue to define justice.” On a recent livestream following the killing of Renee Good in Minnesota, Bundy told his audience that ICE’s conduct “clearly looks like tyranny.” If the government threatened his family, he said, he would fight back by whatever means necessary.

I spoke with Bundy a few hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed Alex Pretti. “It’s sickening to me,” he told me over the phone, “just to see the parallels of history repeating itself.” (In his November essay, he had compared the administration’s treatment of immigrants to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.) He added, “When it comes to the more humanitarian side of it, I think the left has it much more correct than the nationalist right.”

Bundy, to be clear, has not gone woke. He believes that Democrats, whom he calls “communist-anarchists,” are “spurred by wickedness.” (So, he says, are Republicans, whom he calls “nationalists.”) He believes that government has no business providing virtually any social services. He believes that homosexuality is a sin. And don’t ask him about vaccination requirements.

But perhaps Bundy’s central belief is the inviolability of individual liberty, and in this he has remained fairly consistent over the years. During the first Trump presidency, Bundy took heat from some of his followers for opposing the administration’s anti-immigration agenda, and when I first spoke with him a few years ago, he reiterated those views. If he has become something of an outcast, that testifies less to a transformation in his thinking than to a broader realignment on the far right. Bundy, in his relative ideological fixity, offers a stable reference point against which to measure that shift.

In 2014, Bundy and his father, Cliven, marshaled about 1,000 militiamen and other supporters to repel government agents trying to impound their cattle in Bunkerville, Nevada. (Twenty years earlier, in an effort to protect the endangered Mojave desert tortoise, the Bureau of Land Management had ordered Cliven Bundy to remove his cattle from federal lands; he ignored the directive.) The standoff turned the Bundys into the first family of the Patriot Movement and darlings of conservative media. They might not have been quite at the Republican Party’s ideological core, but they weren’t very far away from it. They were avatars of a conservative belief in the importance of individual liberty and the righteousness of resistance—even armed resistance, if necessary—to government tyranny. In a Fox News poll asking thousands of viewers whether they were “Team Cliven Bundy or Team Federal Government,” 97 percent answered “team Cliven.” Several Republican U.S. Senators publicly defended the family. Sean Hannity repeatedly had Cliven on his show.

Two years later, Ammon led a six-week occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that left one rancher dead, shot down by police officers after a backwoods car chase. From 2022 to 2023, he was embroiled in a slow-motion standoff with local and state law enforcement in Idaho stemming from his refusal to pay a $52 million judgment against him in a high-profile defamation case.

By that point, the breadth of Bundy’s support had substantially diminished. His exploits no longer garnered the attention of Fox News and its mainstream conservative viewership. And now, even some of his greatest supporters—people whom he and his family inspired to become militants in the first place—seem, in an ideological sense, to have deserted him. After Good was shot and killed, I reached out to a number of those who stood with Bundy at Bunkerville, at Malheur, or afterward. None of them would condemn ICE, and some expressed enthusiastic support.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

When I asked Nick Ramlow, a Montana militant and member of Bundy’s People’s Rights Network, about Good’s killing, he referred me to a recent Supreme Court opinion and stressed that “a jury will make a determination of liability when a civil suit is brought.” In other words, Ramlow, who once told a sheriff that he “better keep his nose clean” because Ramlow had “a bigger army than he does,” didn’t want to comment one way or the other until the courts weighed in.

Eric Parker, who in 2014 made a name for himself by training a semiautomatic rifle on federal agents at Bundy Ranch and who is now the head of the Real Three Percenters of Idaho, had nothing but praise for the agent who killed Good. “I mostly think it’s important to note how impressive it was to get those first two shots off in under a second,” he told me, adding that Good’s wife should be criminally charged (for what, he did not say). Lee Rice, a longtime People’s Rights member and steadfast Bundy supporter who participated in the Oregon standoff, told me when I first met him in 2023 that he didn’t “believe in the government running roughshod over you.” When I spoke with him recently about ICE’s tactics in Minnesota, he said, “I’m supportive of what’s going on, because we need to get these clowns out of here.” Good deserved her fate, he added, because she’d sided with undocumented immigrants.

Some of those in Bundy’s orbit have responded favorably to his essay and video, and a few have changed their mind about ICE enforcement since the killing of Pretti, which the Trump administration has tried to justify by pointing out that Pretti was carrying a gun. “I feel completely different about this one,” Parker texted me after seeing the video of Pretti’s death. Unlike in the case of Good, he didn’t see any self-defense rationale for the shooting. “No detainment just fighting. Disarmed him then shot him.”

But, on the whole, Bundy’s former allies seem to remain solidly in favor of the masked, armed federal agents. Just the other day, Bundy told me, he had a contentious conversation with a militant who had joined him at Malheur. Bundy had always thought that he and his supporters stood for a coherent set of Christian-libertarian principles that had united them against federal power. “We agreed that there’s certain rights that a person has that they’re born with. Everybody has them equally, not just in the United States,” he said. “But on this topic they are willing to completely abandon that principle.”

Bundy finds this ideological betrayal totally baffling. He would start to say something—“I can’t understand how they think …” or “They just can’t, they can’t …”—only to abandon the thought mid-sentence. “It doesn’t make sense to me,” he told me finally. “It’s scary, actually.”

And so Ammon Bundy is politically adrift. He certainly sees no home for himself on the “communist-anarchist” left. Nor does he identify anymore with the “nationalist” right and its authoritarian tendencies. The party that embraced him and the people who supported him have, by and large, left him behind.

He feels, he told me, “a little bit alone.”</div>

First, LLM-type AI may not actually be around in any suitable way in a few years. The business numbers are catastrophic. Second, LLM-type AI misses what is really important, namely quality of architecture and interfaces and ist bad at finding security problems outside of toy examples.

I&#39;m not sure the business numbers are all that important when it comes to code. We already have them trained on _a lot_ of code, and since they&#39;re more focused they can be smaller without being useless compared to the full size ones. If we can run them locally on a single GPU, it doesn&#39;t go away when the bubble pops and the big players stop throwing away money.

As with any tool, they need to be used where they actually offer value. Which is definitely not to architect solutions, but to sanity check smaller c

The hidden costs - especially on up-and-coming devs - is the fact that knowledge isn&#39;t being retained so a solved problem will end up being re-solved by LLM again. And again. And again.

Worse yet, given how human creativity works, this means we won&#39;t see novel applications or solutions. Just layer after layer of mostly functional AI slop

Correction:They&#39;ve been trained on a lot of UNCHECKED code.

Is that pointy hair speak for kernel code contributers?

Based on the summary, to me the use of &quot;upstream&quot; indicates &quot;maintainers&quot;. As in the people responsible for approving and merging.

Disagree  [ I am not a kernel contributor ]. If you look at the mailing list, patches go through multiple iterations, with back and forth between code reviews.

Code ought still be reviewed by humans but if an AI can reduce patchsets from, say, 8 to 5 based on the experiences of a veteran kernel developer then it has performed a service.

And maybe the AI can introduce a special, pedantic, Linus-mode to pre-emptively yell at you when your approach is bad ! :)

Probably confusion caused by too many drugs.

You got the wrong TV, silly head! [youtube.com]

>&quot;...maybe enough time has passed that 3d could be tried again?&quot;

It should be.  3D is not about resolution, but adding depth.  While nobody will see any difference between 4K and 8K video (few can differentiate 2K and 4K at normal distance), EVERYONE will notice 3D.  Some might not like it (I do), or want to bother with it, but it is certainly a major feature.  And for content filmed correctly, it can add a lot to the experience.

1) The lack of buyable content (3D Bluray).2)

My comment was a jab at the fact that our recent 3D mania was not the first one.

It failed this time exactly for the same reason it did the previous times. It&#39;s a novelty that adds no lasting value to anything. There&#39;s only so many times you can be bothered to see random junk popping out of the screen. You&#39;ve seen it once, you&#39;ve seen it all. And then the reasons you list come to play and everyone discovers that while 3D isn&#39;t in any way better than 2D, it is in multiple ways worse. And they walk away from t

>&quot;It&#39;s a novelty that adds no lasting value to anything. There&#39;s only so many times you can be bothered to see random junk popping out of the screen.&quot;

If there is random junk popping out of the screen, then it is exactly the kind of crap content that gives 3D a bad reputation.  Done properly, 3D should and will add positively to the immersive experience.  Maybe you haven&#39;t seen anything done well?  I have a number of movies that were natively shot and mastered in 3D and look fantastic.

Yes and no. Even big budget productions can botch the 3D experience a lot. My prime example is the ending of the first Hobbit movie, when the eagles carry the dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo away.To be fair, that&#39;s not the worst thing they messed up with the Hobbit movie.

To be fair, that&#39;s not the worst thing they messed up with the Hobbit movie.

If 3D is such a failure, why do 3D movies still come out regularly in theatres?

In fact, one of the big reasons Hollywood stopped doing 3D Blu-Ray releases was to encourage people to see the movie in theatres rather than wait for it to come out on disc. By making 3D a theatre exclusive, that is.

3D at home still remains popular, or did, given how VR works. (And anyone complaining about glasses should know a VR headset is much worse than glasses).

3D home releases still happen - Germany with Turbine and Japan s

I don&#39;t know where that popular is. I don&#39;t know anyone that cares about 3D movies the slightest bit, except the one guy who used to ramble about the great potential within, but never knew of any examples of that potential being put to worthy use.

I&#39;m sure there are people who enjoy the spectacular colourful visuals offered by Tron. Otoh there&#39;s also people who enjoy the spectacular colourful visuals offered by dropping acid. Neither of these have anything to do with wha

3d works in theaters. You can make it work by spending big piles of money.

Do you want to spend big piles of money to watch TV at home? Maybe you do, but not enough other people do.

And doing so pretty much killed the market for 3D.

Nobody wants to pay more for the &quot;3D&quot; version of a film if the 3D version is the inferior version. If 3D releases are not being simultaneously released with the regular/HDR/UHD version then people just won&#39;t bother buying it at all. They&#39;ll wait for the far crappier version on netflix or disney+

Not everyone can see 3D.  Iâ(TM)m part of a sizeable minority who donâ(TM)t have any or have just partial stereoscopic vision.  And who wants to wear special glasses to watch TV anyway, especially if they already wear glasses?  I enjoyed the original Avatar for what it was as a story in the cinema (subsequent ones are shit), but it was annoying having to wear the glasses even though they offered nothing to me.

And not everyone can hear in stereo.  Doesn&#39;t mean things should only be in mono.  And not everyone has good 360 degree sound perception, doesn&#39;t mean we should abolish surround sound.  And not everyone can see full color.... you get the idea.

3D video, even done well/correctly, isn&#39;t for everyone.  Nobody is suggesting it should be forced on people :)

Some people (like me) can&#39;t stand high framerate and &quot;motion smoothing&quot;. Some love it.  Most don&#39;t seem to notice or care either w

The problem with 3D is that it&#39;s very hard to get it right. If part of the image is out of focus, some people are going to get headaches. If there is too much use of depth with stuff popping out of the screen, headaches. And even if it is done perfectly, you need special glasses and a good seating position.

8k is the same as all other 2D TV on the viewer&#39;s end. The issue is making it. At 8k you can&#39;t do manual focus, for example. You need upgraded editing equipment. It&#39;s been deployed in Japan for years, and

I can do you better.  My major cable company thinks that in 2026, &quot;HD&quot; means 720p.  Every channel is only 720p.

Ironically, it&#39;s possible. Processing power and refresh rates have improved enough to get rid of the flicker thing. Streaming has all but replaced Blu Ray so there&#39;s enough bandwidth to make it work. AI would maybe be useful for converting 2D media into 3D. Displays are big enough to make the image look like you&#39;re watching through a gigantic window. It&#39;s those damned shutter glasses that might be the final hurdle. Well, and making the screen viewable for 2D and 3D watchers at the same time without covering

I think the problem is the short-sightedness of everything.&quot;3D&quot; came out with HD was still 720p60 and 1080iIt never had the required resolution to do good 3D.

And 3D implemented this way would also never work due to viewing angles. The reality is that only way to get AR/VR/XR video and games is a dedicated HMD, and surprise surprise the TV makers aren&#39;t in this market.

We do not need &quot;8K video&quot; what we need is 3D video that actually has depth and tactile effects. Without depth, it&#39;s just a video you can&#39;t act

For an immersive cinematic experience, TV has to take up 50 degrees field of view (a fist held out length-wise at arm&#39;s distance is 10 degrees). You would make out the pixels in a 4K TV at that distance if your vision is 20/20. For normal TV .. 40 degrees is fine. In my case, even with a 4K TV taking up 30 to 40 degrees of my field of view I can easily make out the pixels .. BUT my vision is better than 20/10.

Remember for a while people were saying we didn&#39;t need 4K, and that HD was good enough. And before

Are you also planning on getting theater releases of films? Cause otherwise you&#39;re not going to get 8k. There&#39;s literally zero &quot;cinematic&quot; quality content available in 8k for the consumer market.

No one wants this shit. Absolutely no one. It&#39;s not going to take off and you&#39;re smoking some good drugs if you think it is.

Hey was this you back in 2014? https://hardware.slashdot.org/... [slashdot.org]Or this? https://hardware.slashdot.org/... [slashdot.org]

You&#39;re an outlier. Top 0.1% vision. Or better.

I&#39;ve got very good vision. Diopt 0.0 in both eyes. Due to my age I will be needing reading glasses within a couple of years but for now I can still read fine without them.

For me, the difference between HD and 4K is visible but small. I can&#39;t resolve individual pixels on 4K at any reasonable distance.

Since most people will have worse vision than us, 4K will be beyond their limit. 8K is only adding cost without adding quality.

You can make out the pixels... I mean, sure, if you have a black field with a white pixel on it, you will see the white pixel. But put a normal picture on the screen, and tell me that you can see the individual pixels in the picture? You have a great imagination, or maybe the actual picture isn&#39;t 4k.

I am sitting pretty close (50cm) to a display with a horizontal resolution of 2560 (so, a lot less than 4k). Probably 45-50 degrees in my field of view. The text I&#39;m writing, sure, I can pretend that I see the

&quot; In my case, even with a 4K TV taking up 30 to 40 degrees of my field of view I can easily make out the pixels&quot;

Unless you have vision better than that of a bird of prey or you&#39;re sitting a foot away from the screen with a magnifying glass then you&#39;re talking BS.

My vision is 20/13 and I do sub-mm pitch soldering without magnification.

Your vision is better than that of the vast majority of people.

It depends on the TV size and distance from it.  If a TV is small and the viewer sits far away from it, there is no difference between 1080p and 2160p. Get far enough away and there would not even be difference from 576p.

From what I have noticed from my friends (as in - normal people, not the video equivalent of an audiophile), they sit too far from the TV, no matter the TV size. If the TV is small (maybe the person does not have space for it or

It&#39;s down to the availability of panels. They will make a panel with a certain pixel density, and it can be cut to various sizes which results in various resolutions. Of course, the larger you cut it, the more expensive it will be, due both to the amount of material involved but also because the chance of there being defects increases.

Hopefully 8k monitors are not too far off. 4k is good but not perfect. The 6k ones are similar pixel density to smaller 4k monitors, just larger.

Technically impressive, but other than a few early adopters, the public saw no need for it.  8K might do better, but few people can tell the difference with 4K, so they&#39;ll need a better hook than just imperceptible resolution.

I wonder if AI game players could benefit.  Their fake vision is as good as they want.

but few people can tell the difference [when comparing 8K] with 4K,

I can well believe this. For a very long time I really struggled with sub-pixel rendering because it (to me) left visible colour fringes on the edge of letters. It was &quot;bizarre&quot; when the word &quot;well&quot; at the start of this sentence might have one red and one blue &#39;l&#39; for example.

Since switching to 4K I&#39;ve not had a problem. While writing this I double checked and the colour edging is still there but I can&#39;t really see it at all. Now I&#39;ve looked

And I can&#39;t even read your post from a foot away because it has weird shit in it.

majority of people don&#39;t need that much resolution. It&#39;s marketing shit.

Perhaps, but I&#39;d like to have 8k.  4k on a 48&quot; has noticeable text quality issues at 3-4&#39; and deserves 4k.  1080p on a 13.3&quot; has the same issue at ~1.5&#39;, and deserves 4k.

I&#39;m sure these companies love it when people like you beg them to take more of your money.

majority of people don&#39;t need that much resolution. It&#39;s marketing shit.Right, but we (the computer/software/developer/CAD/graphic design type people) care. 8k is completely lost in motion blur and almost useless for watching films on anything but a full home cinema. On the other hand, it&#39;s really useful if you want to have static text or compare detailed photo images.

>&quot;It wasn&#39;t hard to predict that 8K TVs wouldn&#39;t take off,&quot; the article concludes. &quot;In addition to being too expensive for many households, there&#39;s been virtually zero native 8K content available to make investing in an 8K display worthwhile...&quot;

Completely skirts that nobody will be able to see any difference between 4K and 8K on any living-room sized TV viewed from a normal distance.  Most people can&#39;t even see a difference between 2K and 4K in motion video.

People will get bigger TVs .. also AI upscaling from 4K to 8K can make it look good.

I don&#39;t think it matters.  It could be a 150&quot; TV.  If viewed at the typical 10 to 15 feet away, I still suspect 99+% of the public would not be able to tell which is 4K and which is 8K when we are talking about motion video.  A small number might be able to tell with a static photo.  4K hit a hugely diminishing-return point.

And if you start getting insanely big TV&#39;s, then normal distance from it will be annoying.  So you would need to sit much further away, and at that point

broadcast tv is still shit-tier bitrate 1080p (or even sometimes 720p/1080i still). streaming platforms are marginally better bitrate, but still rarely even have 4k content. there are 4k blu-ray movies. but honestly, im not sure i&#39;ve seen any 8k content ANYWHERE!? im sure if i explicitly search for it, i can find it, but the casual content around me is 4k or lower.

and beyond that, we&#39;re also at the point of diminishing returns. we&#39;re at the point where the production cost of the convent vs the demand makes &quot;no sense&quot; from the business side of things. the extra storage, extra bandwidth, extra processing for 8k content is quite significant, and the market demand for it is near-zero. its an e-penis pissing competition to brag that you got 8k content rather than an otherworldly better experience. in the real world, it is a marginal perceptual increase in quality, compared to something like better HDR spec has a much larger noticeable increase in the overall experience.

mind you, i&#39;m saying this as a super geeky person who would absolutely fucking LOVE to have a high refresh rate 8k monitor for my primary workstation.

but honestly, im not sure i&#39;ve seen any 8k content ANYWHERE!? im sure if i explicitly search for it, i can find it, Have a look where Betamax failed, in the corner of porn you&#39;ll find some 8K smut :)

TVs have reached the point of &quot;good enough&quot; that there isn&#39;t really going to be anything revolutionary, rather evolutionary. A panel gets slightly better colour, higher refresh rates and lower G2G times become cheaper, a new panel that uses less power. Nothing to make you race out and buy a new TV but enough over a few years that you might notice a difference between a new TV and your 8yr old model. 

It&#39;s a lot like Blurry,

I&#39;m posting this from my home PC with Dell&#39;s 8k monitor.  It&#39;s nice to see completely crisp text, even at small sizes, and certainly a noticeable quality improvement from 4k.  But that&#39;s because I am sitting a few inches away.  I recently bought a new television, and while I was tempted to pick up a cheap used 8k model, in practice it would make no difference when viewing it from the sofa.

Even Dell seems to have retreated from 8k, however.  Their newer top-end monitor has a roughly 6k horizontal resolution.

Silly premise.  The future will bring us 8K, and heck, much better resolutions than that too.  There are quite a few things leading to it not being popular *yet*.

1. Something needs to drive it, without jitter.  That means whatever storage medium the movies/series are on, needs to have enough processing power to decode the video and ship it to the TV.  This is less of a problem now in 2025, but my original Popcorn Hour box had problems with 1024p.  And that was in 2015.2. There need to be enough bandwidth, e

Besides the content, you just don&#39;t need it at these sizes. Even if you sit right up next to it, 4k is better than most people need it to be up to somewhere between 30-40&quot; depending on eyesight. And most people aren&#39;t right up in front of their TVs, they&#39;re well away where it really doesn&#39;t matter. For that, 1080p is about as good as it needs to be for most people up until around 40-50&quot;. So unless a lot more people get more money and more space for TVs, instead of owning nothing and being expected to like i

Sure, there are minor cases where the difference can mean something.But not for the common folk.

In that sense, you aren&#39;t gonna find any practical difference.

I can understand manufacturers can feel that it&#39;s ok to push technologies that works on some contexts than current tech has problems like really big screens.

But most people aren&#39;t gonna pay for a premium capability that they can&#39;t see.

But at least the won&#39;t comply if the change doesn&#39;t mean more price or a greater disadvantage. So if man

It&#39;s got better resolution than the real world!

How is Europe going to launch satellites without a reusable rockets?

Who said anything about launching satellites?  The spacenews article uses the phrase &quot;launches government satcom program&quot;, which is different from &quot;launching government satellites&quot;.  It also mentions using satellites &quot;already on-orbit&quot;.  The slashdot title uses the word &quot;Deploys&quot;, which avoids this confusion.

Their stated goal is for the satellites to be &quot;built in Europe, operated in Europe, and under European control.&quot;  They don&#39;t say &quot;launched by Europe&quot;.

A more relevant question might be if the satellites

You do realise that the first satellite was launched in 1957?

The reusable first stage Themis is assembled and will fly later this year, see picture https://cnes.fr/en/projects/th... [cnes.fr] of course the whole project will take some years to complete, but it&#39;s not like starting from scratch.

The European Commission is elected, just indirectly. It is a process of several steps, which combine proposals, vetting, interviews and European Parliament confirmation. Not much different than, say, the US congress electing the various executive branch administrators.

Also, the citizens of Europe today are a lot more sovereign, and over a much larger territory than they were 50 years ago, because the EU is still taking the public opinion more seriously than any other confederation in existence.

I&#39;ve been in this business for over 30 years. The output of Claude Code is orders of magnitude cheaper than consultants, employees, even the lowly off-shore developers working for peanuts.

It doesn&#39;t matter what programming language. It doesn&#39;t matter what application. The platform is irrelevant. The complexity is even less of a factor. This isn&#39;t hype or fear; it&#39;s the new reality.

The last IT skill all you guys may ever learn is how to wield AI.

It&#39;s the customer that drives that. Back in the 90s, a friend of mine worked at a textile factory in North Carolina. They were producing high quality fabric at $20 a pound. The Asians were offering slightly lower quality &quot;good enough&quot; fabric at $4 a pound. What did the consumer choose? Take a guess. Don&#39;t bitch at the manufacturer, bitch at the consumer preference. You see two products on the shelf one is cheaper and you know it sacrifices quality. You don&#39;t care.

You see two products on the shelf one is cheaper and you know it sacrifices quality. You don&#39;t care. Most don&#39;t care.Those that do care often enjoy the kind of quality and benefit that infers buy once, cry once.  Constantly replacing even &quot;cheap&quot; items makes them not cheap.  Inflation is a bitch when you consider *anything* you bought last century and are now buying again is twice as expensive.  Multiply that across a lifetime and you can really start to find respect a product built and guaranteed for life.  Including the price.I wonder who might still be using high quality North Carolina fabric, and who

Multiply that across a lifetime and you can really start to find respect a product built and guaranteed for life.  Including the price.

I wonder who might still be using high quality North Carolina fabric, and who

Blaming the customer never worked. It looks like there is a market for a slightly lower quality $4 product. There may be a market for the higher quality product at $8 even when there is a $4 product. But no market for $20 when the alternative is a not too bad $4 product. If you feel better, tell your customers they are stupid, but don&#39;t expect that it makes them come back.

I think the argument is that the AI assistant is so cheap it is worth using even if it is not better than the human. So cheap it even compares favourably to a totally free intern, in that an AI assistant is available 24/7, does not complain, quit, is not temperamental nor hard to manage. Both make stupid mistakes, but the AI is more consistent along time, such that after an habituation period you can depend on it within usefulness boundaries you come to establish.

Current AI prices are all deceiving, since AI hasn&#39;t entered the shareholder value maximising phase, quite the opposite. It won&#39;t be exactly cheap when the enshittification starts. It will still be cheaper than real developers.

I notice that you said the output of Claude is cheaper, not better.  Thank you mister clueless pointy-haired boss who doesn&#39;t care if your company produces shit code and shit products, as long as it is &quot;cheaper&quot;.Thank Microsoft, for writing The Billionaire&#39;s Guide to Suck-cess? Thank the consumer, who kept buying it?  Like, every time?How many more thanks across the face would you like?  Feels like you&#39;re standing next to two sheiks arguing over a Cannonball Run.

OK, please tell me how to avoid writing code like this:

a, err := foo()if err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf(&quot;foo failed: %w&quot;, err)}
b, err := bar(a)if err != nil {
  return fmt.Errorf(&quot;bar failed: %w&quot;, err)}

(Ignore for the moment whether you&#39;re using a version of Go that rejects the second &quot;err :=&quot;, which requires kludgier code, and that both &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; will be much longer in real life.)

You said that correctly, &quot;cheaper&quot; as in &quot;cheaply (and hence badly) made&quot;.

Yes, LLMs allow you to make code even cheaper. But you still only get what you pay for. They are not magic. I do get that many people really do not get the idea of &quot;quality&quot; and how not having it ruins you in the longer term.

Also note that LLM-type AI is bound to be come A LOT more expensive in the near future, after the inevitable crash from the utterly catastrophic business stats.

You could be right.He&#39;s not right, he&#39;s a liar.  Even the most ardent AI evangelist doesn&#39;t say &quot;the platform is irrelevant and the complexity is even less of a factor.&quot; Beyond being nonsensical, it doesn&#39;t match the reality of AI (it&#39;s widely acknowledge to be better at some things than others).

I hope you do not plan to give that code any publicly available interfaces. Because LLMs are absolute crap at writing secure code. Probably because most people that proudly put their code on the net as &quot;examples&quot; are too.

If I was going to give a public interface to anything, it&#39;s going to go through the same process that I have been using for a number of years now - a templated design that has been tested/pentested/tested again for holes. And these days, it will likely be behind an AWS api gateway as well if we&#39;re talking about internet-facing apis.

I see you are being careful. Good. Careful and competent people can be trusted with any tool.

I had a student look at how well LLMs do with security (including several paid ones up to around the $100 tier) and the results for anything that matters (security-patch level or CVE level) are pretty bad. If code is well isolated, that matters not that much, unless it is something high profile with a lot of visibility.

That unmaintainable app will provide an interesting lesson. Fixing complex code is typically more

This reflects my experience as well. It really lowers the bar of entry for much of technical work. It suits well when the cost of trying it out is nothing.It can help learning a lot if it does not replace thinking. It can be an extremely kind and patient tutor, useful even if it is sometimes wrong.

But I also started with a basic architecture diagram of what I wanted, and that is also a big factor. Do you recommend using UML to diagram your architecture, or is it basic enough that SGML worked fine?

To be fair, there are tons of fools around. The very AI hype currently going shows that nicely. Or the 8 or so previous, equally mindless AI hypes. Although they were smaller and did not have a global economic crash at their end.

What a great win for AI! Go info would be just as fast to look up directly (but no hallucination), and cut & paste needs care anyways. Better write a function.

Sounds like an entirely redundant use that will fall into &quot;slightly faster .... slightly slower&quot; and in no way even remotely justifies the effort that goes into LLMs. Or the risks, because that AI generated code may well not have copyright, may leak and may have hallucinations in it. Or, worse, attack code from model poisoning. And the module info

Yeah, it is the stack exchange, but without the third comment by the person who actually got the question correctly and wrote the proper answer.

I don&#39;t trust the parties providing 3rd party AI services with my IP, data or commercial secrets. It&#39;s in the AI companies interest to rob my data to improve their product.

And I certainly don&#39;t trust them to manage integration with stuff behind my firewall or my money.

So no AI will not own my code base because I don&#39;t want it to. It&#39;s a security risk.

If you are interested in this technology, I suggest find a way for companies to easily grow and integrate LLM behind their firewall, independently, without hav

Even some rich people have a red line they will not want to cross. Admittedly, many do not. This guy does not seem to have been born rich, so he may actually be a much better person than those that have been and he may just think that he does not need more money.

While it is possible, sometimes things are just what they seem to be.

Oh don’t worry politicians and rich folks are excluded by default.

&quot;No surveillance&quot; of ... anyone? Ever?  Or what?Please.  The way they get around such verbiage, is to simply re-define it.We&#39;re not surveilling.  We&#39;re merely observing.  No?  OK, then we&#39;re studying.  Or, observing.  You know, think of the children and shit.Hell, my gut feeling is the reason it&#39;s being pushed back is because Anthropics surveillance is taking money out of the pockets of others doing the same damn surveillance.  Not like we&#39;re going to pretend anyone is running low on that shit these days.

Not domestic surveillance or policing. That is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act  [wikipedia.org]. That this is most probably a contract to operate the system means that Anthropic anticipated seeing the data during the course of business and wanted nothing to do with possible violations of the law. Or having to confront a customer about it after the fact. So they put a clause in the contract.

I was evaluating AI coding assistants for my company a while ago, and of course Claude Code was on my shortlist. But after discussing Anthropic&#39;s collaborating with the fascist US regime, our company decided to practice economic withdrawal and take our money to a European supplier.

OK, so which &quot;European supplier&quot; are you talking about ?I know of only one European AI company: Mistral.(And then there is DeepL, but they specialize on translation.)

When having some (probably not too strong) morals disqualifies you as a business partner.

One of the corporate news outlets (NYT or WaPo) had an article in the last few days about ICE (the Gestapo) setting up a surveillance system for migrants. Oh? And will it be restricted to them or will the Gestapo turn it on everyone? That Gestapo force only reports to Home Sec.; with the R&#39;s in Congress there is no oversight. Right now, Home Sec. is running ads on Youtube claiming you cannot travel by plane without a real ID. They are lying. You can as long as you have another form of acceptable ID like a p

A friendly reminder to all to take your meds and stay hydrated!

All it has to do is to make targeted advertising even creepier and detailed.

&quot;Is Meta&#39;s Huge Spending on AI Actually Paying Off?&quot;

In terms of shuffling money around so some or all of it can be diverted or siphoned off, yes, it&#39;s paying off big time for them or they wouldn&#39;t be doing it. Meta doesn&#39;t bother with small grifts or scams, it&#39;s always something grand and &#39;transformative&#39; etc etc etc.

In short, it&#39;s a circle-jerk with money. Meta and OpenAI and NVIDIA and Intel and Micron and others are all passing shitloads of debt and money around and around like trading cards, and the ride is going to stop sooner or later with some major financial repercussions. Someone is going to be left holding the bag.

So yeah, the money is being spent and it is going somewhere, but probably not where we&#39;re told it&#39;s going.

Or meta is charging its customers more for AI-generated clicks, and the customers are yet to catch up.

When I read the headline, I thought it was &quot;pay off&quot; so &quot;...actually a pay off?&quot;

After a while the revenue stream gets optimized and you get deminisihing returns the more you optimize. The are a limited amount of business willing to spend money in advertising eventually you run into limits

Right now the pushers aren&#39;t much interested in ROI or whether it&#39;s ready for prime time.  They&#39;re just trying to stake out a big market share while things are still fluid.

Seriously. The fact that Meta is even still around is a nice testimony to general stupidity.

the fact that Zuck is still emperor is a clear refutation of the &quot;merit-based&quot; ideology

The ad business has become very aggressive. Ads have well passed the annoying bar into intrusive. Having Zuck walking up to you into in the street and shoving a advert in your face every 30 seconds would deserve a punch in the face. That&#39;s where we are now on the internet. And Facebook UX is atrocious for ads. And the mostly young on other platforms aren&#39;t spending much, because they don&#39;t have much.

This story looks like BS slippery accounting for the funding round.

I make a conscious decision to not click o

If the deepening rift between the United States and Europe hardens into a permanent split, historians will look back at January as a turning point.

The harbingers were the speeches at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, first from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who urged middle-sized countries to band together against the large powers’ unfair dominance, then from President Donald Trump, who heaped a staggering amount of  contempt and scorn on America’s allies, even by his already-alarming standards.

But the kicker came in actions that allied leaders took after Davos. Most dramatically, starting Jan. 30, 10,000 troops from 11 nations of NATO launched a military exercise—its largest scheduled for the coming year—without the participation of any American troops. This is unprecedented in the alliance’s 77-year history.

In other events leading up to the NATO exercise:

Canada signed a major free-trade deal with China, allowing, among other things, a massive import of Chinese cars.

The European Union signed a trade agreement with India—and a still-larger one with South America’s Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), the latter of which will create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world.

The French Parliament passed a law barring government officials from using U.S. platforms, such as Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, for videoconferencing.

Denmark, still reeling from Trump’s threats to take over Greenland, announced it was selling its stash of U.S. Treasury notes, worth $100 million. Even before these moves, central banks worldwide—not just in Denmark—have been shifting their reserves toward other countries’ currencies. An analysis by J.P. Morgan calls this trend “de-dollarization” and attributes it, in part, to the turbulence of Trump’s tariffs—many of them imposed for punitive and arbitrary reasons—and also to perceptions of a decline in “the U.S.’s overall standing as the world’s leading economic, political and military power.”

In each of the last eight months, the U.S. has seen a steadily steep decline in the number of tourists from abroad, especially from Western Europe, resulting in a loss of $12.5 billion in revenue. (This isn’t because foreigners are staying home; of 184 nations analyzed by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the U.S. is the only one seeing a drop in international visitors; foreigners are traveling, just not to our shores.)

As concerning as they are, we should not overstate the significance or the magnitude of these developments. They’re, to some extent, reversible; they haven’t shifted the global balance of power—at least not yet. NATO, by charter, is still commanded by a U.S. general, and this isn’t likely to change anytime soon; even in NATO’s go-it-alone exercise, U.S. officers are assisting with logistics and coordination. Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, now NATO’s secretary general, told the European Parliament this week that they were “dreaming” if they thought the EU could defend the continent without U.S. assistance. Much as his remarks annoyed his fellow Europeans, he’s right. Defense analysts in Berlin and London have told me that it would take 10 years for Europe to build an independent defense force—and that’s if they started spending a lot more money on defense right now. (They have boosted their budgets but are limited by their own domestic politics.)

As for world trade, the dollar still reigns supreme; no single alternative currency is anywhere near supplanting it. Trump’s tariff threats—including those that he’s made against Canada and the EU for its recent attempts to break away from American dominance—can still make allied leaders and bankers hesitate.

Still, the trends are genuinely historic. Until the Trump era (and he is defining this era in so many ways), our allies hadn’t seriously even thought about taking any of these steps. But Davos intensified the trends and clarified the rift (or, as Carney put it in his speech, the “rupture”), to the point where they are now not just thinking about taking steps like these but actually taking them.

The New York Times’ story about the NATO exercise noted that it was “conceived long before President Trump was accused of undermining faith in the military alliance,” but this claim is misleading. Yes, it was planned before Davos, where these doubts were intensified—but Trump has been “undermining faith” in U.S.-led alliances generally ever since he was elected back in 2016. Several times since, he has publicly pondered pulling out of NATO, and he has said he would not come to the defense of NATO members under attack—the central pledge of the alliance—if their military budgets were lower than they’d promised.

The Times correctly notes that the exercise, code-named Steadfast Dart, is designed to show what NATO’s European members “can do on their own”—to “test how well they could work together if the American forces, which usually do the heavy lifting, were occupied elsewhere.”

As described on NATO’s website, the scenario played out in the exercise involves mobilizing NATO’s Allied Reaction Force in the event of a crisis on the “eastern front”—i.e., along what would be the opening battle lines of a Russian attack. It’s a reprise of a similar exercise, also called Steadfast Dart, that occurred at this time last year, scheduled deliberately on the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The difference is that last year, U.S. troops were taking part; this year, they’re not.

The test of going it alone isn’t meant as a prediction of whether the United States would send troops to fight in a war for Europe. But Trump has already upended a world where they could count on the U.S. as a reliable trade partner. They now see the need to lay the groundwork for the day when it might no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security. This perception, and the adjustment to it, could well define the next era in world politics.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, typing to you from underneath a sooty, icy snow boulder that has covered the entirety of D.C. for a week. But we’re not mad. Stop saying we’re mad.

Much of the week’s news revolved around the killing of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Republicans’ scrambling to limit the fallout. As the week went on, we got a new Fed chair announcement, Tulsi Gabbard showing up at an FBI raid in Georgia, and what appears to be a long weekend government shutdown? Don Lemon, you will have to wait until next week, sorry. If only the Surge could control the flow and spacing of news events, the world would run a lot smoother.

Let’s begin with the Cabinet member bearing most of the blame for the events of Minnesota.

The lack of turnover in the second Trump administration has been a marked difference from the first term. Top staff and Cabinet members aren’t getting axed left and right. The only high-level change we’ve seen has been former national security adviser Mike Waltz getting “demoted” to United Nations ambassador for getting slippery-fingered with his group chat invites. There’s a reason for this shift: President Donald Trump, as he reportedly felt during the deliberations over Waltz’s future, doesn’t want to give the liberal media a “scalp.” It’s a sign of weakness to, uh, provide accountability following screw-ups.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week seemed to come the closest a Cabinet official has come to a Trump axing this term. The administration flinched from its initial (and typical) belligerent messaging following the Customs and Border Protection killing of Pretti in Minneapolis. That left Noem out on a limb. It was Noem, after all, whose department oversaw the Minneapolis operation and Noem who, as the face of that department, said in the press conference afterward that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.” Democratic calls for her impeachment shot through the roof—and even some Republicans called on her to step down, as well. (More on that later.) Noem met with the president for two hours Monday night to plead her case. For now, it looks like Trump’s instincts not to give the media a “scalp” are winning out. Or, as with Waltz, he’s just waiting a spell for the fires to calm down before sending her on her way.

Noem wasn’t the only administration official rushing to call Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” White House policy chief and all-around architect of heavy-handedness Stephen Miller also called Pretti that, as well as an “assassin” looking to “murder” agents. Team Noem, in its effort to save her, went running to Axios to blame Miller for the incendiary language. We fully believe her. Immediately calling someone an “assassin” or “terrorist” without knowing much information is Miller’s M.O., and Miller is more powerful than Noem. Of course the administration’s ludicrous initial response was his handiwork.

Miller, however, is a master at deflecting consequences when his own aggressive policy views put the administration in hot water. During the outrage over family separation during Trump’s first term, then–DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lost her job while Miller mysteriously kept his, as journalist Jonathan Blitzer pointed out. Amid the Minnesota outrage, Noem is the Cabinet official in trouble, Border Patrol “commander” Greg Bovino was schlepped back to rural California to await his retirement, while Miller continues to run administration policy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for better or worse, summed up Miller’s job security accurately on Fox News this week. “To my colleagues who believe that you can convince Donald Trump that Stephen Miller is a liability for him, good luck with that,” he said. “When this clock strikes 12 on the Trump era, there will be a few people walking out the door with Donald Trump. Stephen Miller will be in that group.”

After the Pretti killing, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took the position that Democrats wouldn’t advance a bill funding DHS without new reforms to immigration enforcement. The DHS funding was supposed to be included in a package with five other departmental funding bills and voted on this week, before a Friday night deadline. Schumer and Democrats demanded Republicans strip the DHS funding portion from the package, pass the other five, and buy a little time to work on DHS reforms. After a few days of talks, Senate Republicans and the White House … agreed to this! As we type, the Senate is slowly processing this agreement. (That’s Senate shorthand for waiting out a Lindsey Graham hissy fit.) Once they’re done, the House is expected to vote on the deal Monday. So there may be a wee technical funding gap for a few days, but nothing to write home about.

The deal extends DHS funding for only two weeks, setting up a sprint to legislate on the most contentious issue in politics. Schumer, with feedback from his caucus, has settled on three demands: ending roving patrols by ICE while tightening warrant rules, establishing a universal code of conduct governing federal law enforcement officers’ use of force, and barring officers from wearing masks while requiring them to turn on bodycams and have proper identification. These demands will run into issues from both directions. Progressives will (and are) chastising Democrats for asking for too little at a time when Republicans are reeling on this issue. And if DHS funding negotiations are going to be reopened, Republicans will put together their own series of requests targeting, for example, sanctuary cities. This won’t be easy.

Trump announced Friday morning that he would nominate financier Kevin Warsh to replace Jay Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve once Powell’s term ends in mid-May. Is this good? At least Trump picked someone from the requisite profession instead of a money-related figure from TV, such as Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo or pro wrestling’s Ted “Million Dollar Man” DiBiase. Warsh served on the Fed Board from 2006 to 2011 and worked closely with then-Chair Ben Bernanke during the financial crisis. He was Trump’s runner-up for the chairmanship in 2017, losing out to Powell. On another note, Warsh’s father-in-law is Ron Lauder, the cosmetics magnate and GOP donor responsible for putting the idea of annexing Greenland into Trump’s head.

If and when he is confirmed, the question will be to what extent he separates himself from the debasement he deployed to earn the job. Warsh was known for his hawkish monetary policy views following the 2008 financial crisis, worrying that lower interest rates then would cause inflation. (He was quite wrong about that.) But then he wanted to become Fed chair, and so his views have conveniently evolved. In a July interview, he described the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates” as a “mark against them” and added, “One of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” Was he saying what he needed to say to get the job, or does he intend to make interest rate decisions at the president’s urging?

The FBI raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia, on Wednesday because Donald Trump is out of his mind, and his political appointees will do whatever it takes to make him happy. The raid is related to Trump’s dangerous psychological holdup that he won the 2020 election, as well as a means of revenge against Fulton County for prosecuting him. And so a dozen or so agents dug around to search for “physical ballots from the 2020 general election,” per the warrant. If only this were all a joke. As Slate contributor Rick Hasen writes, the raid could be “a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026.” Democratic lawyers may want to consider ramping up their strength training ahead of the fall season.

The most hallucinatory part of the raid, though, may have been the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the scene. It had seemed as if Gabbard was mothballed since the administration took its turning toward bombing, or threatening the further bombing of, various countries. As the Wall Street Journal reported, though, Gabbard “has spent months investigating the results of the 2020 election” and is “leading the administration’s effort to re-examine the election and look for potential crimes.” This is dark stuff. Playing gumshoe on conspiracy theories surrounding past domestic elections is not in the purview of the DNI’s office, and also, Gabbard is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Whatever report she reduces should, then, be laughable. The election-related executive orders it prompts Trump to release won’t be.

As we noted here a couple of weeks ago, retiring North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis has been hammering Trump policy of late but has been loath to directly criticize the president himself. Tillis issued a blockade of Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve once Fed Chair Jay Powell announced he was under investigation, and he called the administration’s pursuit of annexing Greenland “stupid.” In both cases, he laid blame on Trump’s staff for giving him bad advice, rather than on the president for having a bad brain that thinks bad thoughts. Tillis came out firing again this week over the administration’s handling of the Pretti killing, calling for the firing of Kristi Noem. “I think what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters. Once again, though, he framed it in a way that absolved Trump: “It’s just amateurish. It’s terrible. It’s making the president look bad.”

So how does the president feel about this approach that Tillis has taken? Is he fooled by Tillis calling all of his administration’s policies stupid but saying it’s the advisers’ fault? “Well, they’re both losers,” Trump told ABC News on Wednesday of Tillis and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who had also called on Noem to resign. “You know, what can I tell you? They’re terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone.” Tillis’ response to being called a “loser” was, at least, clever. “I am thrilled about that. That makes me qualified to be homeland security secretary and senior adviser to the president,” referring to Noem and Stephen Miller, whom Tillis also despises. He is getting closer each week to blaming the person who continues to employ these chuckleheads and, thus, is responsible for them. Will he one day cross that line?

On Tuesday night, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was speaking at a district event when a man stood up, squirted her with some sort of liquid, and then was tackled to the ground and restrained by Omar’s security detail. Despite members of her team saying she should end her appearance to have tests of the liquid done, Omar insisted on continuing. The assailant, identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, had the sort of online posting history that you would expect and had told a neighbor that he might be arrested at an upcoming Omar event. He was charged with assault, and the liquid was determined to be apple cider vinegar and water. This story about his life is sad.

Omar was direct in pinning blame for the incident. “What the facts have shown since I’ve gotten into elected office,” she said Wednesday, “is that every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.” Indeed, Trump has directed years of racist invective toward Ilhan Omar, all of which has taken on a new acuity as the administration targets the Minnesota Somali community in general. The incident did not prompt a change of heart in Trump’s rhetoric toward Omar. “I think she’s a fraud,” he told ABC News. “I really don’t think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Lawyers love legal reasoning. It promises a clean, clear path through sticky, tricky territory. But legal reasoning can enable grotesque real-world outcomes, like torture, or arresting journalists, or masked government agents detaining and disappearing people. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is in conversation with Joseph Margulies, Professor of Practice of Government at Cornell University. Margulies litigated some of the biggest cases of egregious human rights violations of the post-9/11 “War on Terror”, an experience that informed his recent piece in the Boston Review: The Moral Stupefaction of America. Margulies explains how, when we allow obscure legal language to overshadow moral imperatives, we can end up in very dark places. The line from waterboarding at black sites to executing American citizens in the streets is a straight one. And there will be a lawyer willing to write a memo for all of it.

Why is the Trump administration arresting journalists and activists over a protest inside a Minnesota church? The official reason the government cited Friday—when it arrested independent journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort, as well as two others—was that they were part of a “coordinated attack” on Cities Church in St. Paul. It’s a strange claim: Videos from the incident, which occurred Jan. 18, showed protesters being loud in interrupting a worship service, but not physically touching anyone or damaging any property. The protest may have been unpleasant for those in the pews—videos showed at least one man haranguing people for their complicity in supporting ICE—but it’s hardly an “attack.”

The incident has, however, gone viral in conservative media—proof positive of the degeneracy of the Minnesota protesters and yet another example of the left’s anti-Christian bigotry. Critics of the protest portrayed it as an intrusion of vulgar politics into a sacred refuge from daily life, a faceoff between vicious activists and apolitical (and bewildered) parishioners. For an administration obsessed with firing up its base supporters, arresting participants has an obvious political use. That’s especially true of Lemon, who because of his former job at CNN is a household name and much-reviled figure on the right.

But this isn’t just a case of red meat for the base. These activists have, perhaps inadvertently, come up against some very well-connected people. Despite efforts to portray it as an apolitical island of faith, Cities Church has extensive ties to a deeply political network within the larger Christian nationalism movement—a network with ties to the upper echelons of the Trump administration.

Some of the connections are obvious: The protest was aimed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who served as a lay pastor at the church. The pastor, David Easterwood, was not an employee of the church but one of a number of elders in it. He serves as the field officer for ICE’s operations in St. Paul and has appeared publicly with Kristi Noem. And Cities Church’s lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, primarily preaches of standard Biblical matters, but he’s not above politics—or broadcasting about it on social media. He has discussed the evils of “transgenderism” and called the pope an “idiot.”

But the more important ties go deeper. Cities Church was founded 11 years ago by a group of theologically conservative men, including a pastor named Joe Rigney. Rigney is no longer a pastor at Cities Church, but he still speaks for it in conservative media appearances. “This is not a political church,” he told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “This is a church that worships Jesus. Loves one another. Seeks the good of their neighbors.”

“It’s a normal congregation of Christian worshippers,” he said on a separate Fox News segment, speaking to Harris Faulkner. “Every town in this country is filled with people like this who want to worship Jesus, love one another, serve their neighbor, seek the good of these cities.”

But Rigney himself is focused on much more than worshiping Jesus and loving one another. Rigney is currently a pastor of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho. Christ Church is an extremely controversial church, known for essentially taking over the town as part of a religious effort led by a pastor named Doug Wilson. Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches have hard-right views on women’s rights, including opposition to women’s suffrage. Wilson has also begun an effort to expand his sphere of influence into Washington: He opened a second campus of Christ Church in D.C. in 2025 with the explicit goal of molding powerful Republicans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a church affiliated with the network.

“With the change in administration, we believe that there will be many strategic opportunities with numerous evangelicals who will be present both in and around the Trump administration,” Wilson wrote in a blog post at the time. “These believers are obviously culturally engaged already, but we happen to believe that every form of cultural engagement needs to have a solid theological foundation and support, and we want to help to provide it.”

Rigney, as part of this movement, is a highly political figure. He comments on partisan politics on social media, calling, for example, to end Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage. He has written an entire book criticizing “the sin of empathy.” He has appeared on chummy podcasts with William Wolfe, a Baptist activist and author who wrote of Alex Pretti’s killing: “Another foolish person has lost their life trying to obstruct ICE. Here’s my reaction: I don’t care.”

There’s a legitimate debate over how to treat worship spaces in a time of encroaching authoritarianism. But in its discussion of the church protest, conservative media—and now the Trump administration—have presented it as a struggle between leftists and apolitical Christians. That’s a lie: The conversation around the St. Paul church protest should not assume political intentions on just one side.

            <h2>Microsoft's Sinofsky saw Surface fail coming – then hit up Epstein for advice on exit</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/microsoft_sinofsky_epstein/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Sinofsky warned Microsoft that its flagship Surface was about to flop in public, then sought exit advice from Jeffrey Epstein as he negotiated his way out of Redmond.

These details appear in newly released Department of Justice files linked to Epstein, which include emails showing the former Windows boss seeking advice on money, leverage, and what to do next after his abrupt 2012 exit.

There&#39;s no suggestion of criminal behavior by Sinofsky. The exchanges with Epstein offer a rare glimpse at how a senior Microsoft executive sized up failure, and the cost of walking away from it.

The trigger was the Surface RT, Microsoft&#39;s first real attempt to muscle into Apple&#39;s hardware turf. By November 2012, Sinofsky was warning internally that it was going sideways fast.

In an email to CEO Steve Ballmer and COO Kevin Turner, he said the device was &quot;about to catastrophically fail in a very public way,&quot; with sales tracking at roughly one-tenth of even the lowest expectations. Once the numbers escaped, he added, there would be no hiding it. &quot;Word will get out very soon. There is no long term without this.&quot;

Months later, Sinofsky forwarded the same email chain to Jeffrey Epstein, pointing out that Microsoft had gone on to write off $900 million in unsold Surface inventory – more than it had originally planned.

What followed was a series of practical, unsentimental emails about money and constraints. Sinofsky sent Epstein his full retirement agreement, complaining that Microsoft was fixated on restrictive non-competes and reluctant to grant full vesting of stock awards. Unsure what leverage he still had, he asked outright. Epstein&#39;s answer was clear and repeated across messages: ask for $20 million and don&#39;t budge.

&quot;Just repeat 20,&quot; Epstein advised. &quot;Do not let [them] talk you down.&quot;

In the end, Sinofsky walked away with a retirement package worth about $14 million in stock. When details of the deal emerged months later, Epstein chimed in with a short note of his own: &quot;You&#39;re welcome :).&quot;

The emails also detail Sinofsky&#39;s unease about life after Microsoft. He floated the idea of working at Samsung, then immediately worried about being sued. Microsoft, he noted, had a long history of dragging former executives into court under the theory of &quot;inevitable leakage of trade secrets,&quot; filing public, bruising, and professionally disabling cases even when defendants eventually prevailed.

&quot;I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Microsoft people went to competitors. It is nasty, public, and ultimately Microsoft prevailed in all of them,&quot; Sinofsky said. &quot;Either the person backed down or ended up so tarnished they were ineffective.&quot;

Epstein offered to help smooth that path for a $1 million fee, suggesting he could manage internal politics and keep Ballmer from &quot;trashing&quot; Sinofsky in public. Sinofsky ultimately did not join Samsung.

Windows 8 is still Windows 8, and Surface RT remains an expensive mistake. The emails don&#39;t change that. What they do offer is a less polished view of how a senior Microsoft exit actually played out once things started going wrong. It was an executive calling a looming disaster, losing the argument, and then negotiating the terms of getting out, with advice from a fixer whose name now comes with baggage. ®

So this latest public error could be a blessing in disguise for passengers, if not for the bus company hoping to make money. Love it or hate it, this bit of borked digital signage looks to have run into a problem that only an open-source hero can solve.

Spotted by Register reader Jay, today&#39;s entry in the pantheon of bork is a screen bolted to a bus that has failed to boot. Indeed, a grub rescue prompt indicates that something has gone seriously awry.

Judging by the state of the wall beneath the screen, there was likely some decidedly non-digital signage (a paper ad perhaps) stuck there initially. It was replaced with something a little more hi-tech, which has rewarded the passengers by showing them error messages rather than another annoying ad.

In this instance, &quot;Grub&quot; probably refers to Linux&#39;s Grand Unified Bootloader, which many Linux distributions use to handle the system startup process. It fires up the Linux kernel and does the bare minimum to get the hardware operational. So not a sneaky late-night kebab.

The rescue shell (which is where it looks like this bit of signage has left the passengers) can be used to repair a non-booting Linux system. A person with some Linux familiarity could use it to manually identify a partition, locate the grub directory, and persuade the operating system to boot.

Yes, fixing the problem is not for the fainthearted. Without the necessary skills, a grub rescue prompt is of little help, and of course, there is no input device attached, even if a passenger was able to leap to their feet with the words &quot;Don&#39;t worry! I can fix this! I know Linux!&quot;

This is perhaps a version of Speed that a true open source aficionado could really get behind. If the bus drops below a certain speed, Linux will stop booting. After all, it can&#39;t be worse than Speed 2.

As for this screen, Jay told us that it was soon rectified. Was there indeed a Linux guru on board? Someone able to deal with a borked bootloader? No.

&quot;They&#39;ve &#39;fixed&#39; it by turning off the screen.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Barely a month into 2026, electrical power infrastructure on two continents has tested positive for cyberattacks. One fell flat as attempts to infiltrate and disrupt the Polish distribution grid were rebuffed and reported. The other, earlier attack was part of Operation Absolute Resolve, the US abduction of Venezuela&#39;s President Maduro from Caracas on January 3.

Both attacks exhibit what&#39;s called layered ambiguity. The components, timing, and methods in the Polish event are either the product of the same organization that has attacked Ukrainian systems over the past decade, or is an incomprehensible attempt by someone else to mimic them. Meanwhile, all we officially know about how Caracas went dark as the air armada homed in is President Trump saying that the &quot;lights in Caracas were turned off due to a certain expertise we have.&quot; That&#39;s either an army of CIA agents operating under cover of office cleaners in the power stations, or a cyberattack.

What is unambiguous is that infrastructure attacks have come of age. They have history, they are integrated into military strategy, and in the hands of some at least can be expected to work. We can begin to work out what this means for the rest of us, and how to react.

That Venezuela succumbed where Poland stood firm is in some measure due to circumstance. Poland has an infrastructure befitting a successful European economy, while Venezuela is, to be technical, a basket case. Lack of investment but no lack of mismanagement has seen a decade of blackouts and profound power shortages, leading to two-day working weeks and hospitals struggling to keep patients alive. If you can&#39;t keep the lights on, you can&#39;t keep the hackers out.

More strikingly, the democratization of attack technologies over the same ten years has moved infrastructure attacks from the realm of nation-state specialization to a point where a 30-minute YouTube video can give a working example. Open source tools like the Shodan infrastructure search engine, Google, and Wikipedia now resemble the 1980s NSA&#39;s most potent fantasies. There&#39;s even a one-stop guide, MITRE ATT&CK, a complete curriculum of what to do when going up against a large organization and how to do it.

To counter this opening up of techniques is the limited scope of success. You can disrupt things for a while, but the victim is highly motivated and prepared to get things back on again. Perhaps you can cause some short-term physical or economic damage. Anything further, as Russia has demonstrated, requires more traditional methods.

As part of a fog-of-war machine causing maximum confusion and blunting initial defenses, cyberattacks in infrastructure are effective. The Caracas operation used jamming and suppression of air defenses alongside the power outages, allowing the physical assets to get in and out. Russia has been notoriously unable to operate with that level of cohesion – its Polish effort is part of Operation Chaotic Thug Next Door – to go alongside the asset vandalism, political meddling, and corruption.

All this makes cyber infrastructure attacks a significant, serious threat, one that is pretty poor at political extortion or a singular game changer. It suffers from many of the limiting factors of infiltration and espionage, in that it&#39;s hard to test and harder to use without giving the game away. The discovery of Salt Typhoon in US communications infrastructure is a jarring exhibition of vulnerability, but also signaled its demise. Likewise, the evolution of open source tools and techniques for infrastructure attacks looks unwelcome, but it can become a powerful path to evolve and harden defenses.

A lot of this defensive design will be needed anyway to survive in an environment of climate change disasters, uncertainties of energy supply chains, and demographic shifts. Flexibility, resilience, and redundancy are expensive to design in, more so to leave out. As with any security threat, there is no one golden shield.

Even if every electronic perimeter was impregnable, a hefty bribe to a vulnerable insider or the penetration of an organization by long-term agents will do the trick. The damage one person could do to infrastructure in the pre-networked age was very limited. Give them a USB stick, and the picture changes.

Thus, while the increased cadence of infrastructure cyberattacks may look like a crisis in the making, if it is, it&#39;s too good a crisis to waste. It&#39;s a chance to do double duty of increased awareness and spending on survival in a world of chaotic thug neighbors. To an extent, this is happening. In the UK, demonstrable cyber resilience is an integral, top-of-mind factor in all the national energy distribution expansion plans – it&#39;s just not talked about much. It should be.

As should national policy on responses to cyberattacks. There is no deterrence when an enemy can rely on ambiguity and a security-led reluctance to publicly say what we know, and where the preponderance of evidence leads. Every push across boundaries that doesn&#39;t elicit a proportionate response is an incremental defeat. At some point, it&#39;s no longer incremental. Cyber infrastructure attacks are now a part of military force, and should be treated accordingly. Clarity is everything here.

Meanwhile, while absolutely condemning all forms of electronic vandalism, we do warmly recommend getting up to speed on the same open source tradecraft material that the bad hats are using. An aware citizenry is half the battle in civic defense, and that counts double in the digital domain. Be part of the solution, not the problem. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Microsoft has had a bad start to the year. Two out-of-band updates in the weeks after the first Patch Tuesday of 2026 rattled administrators&#39; already shaky faith in the company. But are things getting worse?

According to Register readers, and the company&#39;s own release health dashboard, the answer has to be yes. It isn&#39;t just you. The frequency of emergency out-of-band releases for the company&#39;s operating systems has been rapidly increasing to the point where, for every Patch Tuesday update, there&#39;ll likely be at least one out-of-band patch to fix whatever got broken.

To be fair to Microsoft, it is also more than capable of emitting out-of-band releases when it finds things have been broken that were not part of the Patch Tuesday cadence.

Microsoft states that out-of-band releases &quot;are used in atypical cases, such as security vulnerabilities or a quality issue, when devices should be updated immediately instead of waiting for the next monthly quality update release.&quot;

We asked Microsoft Copilot what &quot;atypical&quot; meant. It responded: &quot;The word &#39;atypical&#39; simply means not typical – something that is unusual, irregular, or out of the ordinary.&quot;

As opposed to &quot;something that seems to be happening quite a lot lately.&quot;

In April 2025, Windows Server 2022 got an out-of-band update. It was soon joined by Windows Server 2025. May last year was a busy month for the Microsoft bork fairy as multiple out-of-band updates were released for the company&#39;s desktop as well as its server products, and so it goes on.

Even Windows 10, the general demise of which was announced last year, has continued to require out-of-band updates, despite the ending of free support. With much fanfare, Microsoft pulled the plug on many versions in October, but offered the olive branch of Extended Security Updates. However, with every update since, the company has had to follow up with at least one fix.

While it is important not to mix causation and correlation, it is difficult not to note that the current spate of emergency updates has coincided with Microsoft laying off thousands of employees and CEO Satya Nadella boasting that more than 30 percent of the company&#39;s code was the result of AI contributions.

That Microsoft rapidly pushes out fixes is a good thing. That stuff got broken in the first place is not so good. And certainly it&#39;s not good for the legions of administrators tasked with managing fleets of Windows devices and virtual machines. Since there is a very good chance that a critical security update might break something and be followed by an out-of-band release (some unkind wags have begun referring to the depressingly regular fixes as OOPs rather than OOBs), many administrators could be tempted to hold off installing a critical security patch for fear that it might result in an unfortunate event.

Reg reader Chris Hill said: &quot;The out-of-band updates mainly complicate the risk assessment of patch timing – whether to leave your company at risk of cyberattack by waiting to patch – or whether to press on, knowing that productivity could also be impacted by a showstopper issue in the update.&quot;

Hill also noted that the potential productivity loss could be huge, &quot;both in terms of people trying to work with the bugs themselves (from the bad patch) and the installation and reboot time required for users and infrastructure.&quot;

The faffing around with administrative tools, the reboot time, and everything else associated with an out-of-band update all mount up, particularly given the millions (or more) of Windows devices worldwide.

We asked Microsoft whether its testing regime had changed over the last year and if it had been making greater use of AI tools in its development processes, but the company has yet to share anything.

For a business keen to promote the productivity gains from its AI tools, such as Copilot, the loss of user productivity caused by the increasing frequency of emergency patches to fix whatever was broken by a previous update is less than ideal.

As administrators deal with two emergency updates in the weeks since January 2026&#39;s Security Update, the words of Microsoft&#39;s CEO – &quot;2026 will be a pivotal year for AI&quot; – will be greeted more with dread than anticipation. ®

            <div id="article-text">Who, Me? Monday brings the shock of a return to work, a transition The Register always tries to ease by bringing you a new instalment of Who, Me?, the reader-contributed column in which your fellow readers admit to errors and disclose how they dodged the consequences.

This week, meet a reader we&#39;ll Regomize as &quot;Steven,&quot; who once got the job of installing a mail server for a client.

&quot;The project went well, until I noticed a board in the server was quite warm,&quot; Steven told The Register. He therefore opened the chassis and slid his hand inside to feel the warm spot.

Steven&#39;s intentions were good, but his memory wasn&#39;t: He was wearing a wedding ring, soon received a small electric shock and heard the telltale sound of a solenoid triggering.

Cursing his foolishness, Steven fought mild panic and tried to bring the box back to life, without success.

At which point his client&#39;s IT manager appeared, pointed out that the server was offline, and asked if everything was in order.

Steven quickly concocted a fib and explained he was midway through a procedure that required a reboot, a story that satisfied his client and left him to find a fix.

&quot;As I began to calculate the cost of the outage and looked up phone numbers to call for help, I heard another click similar to the one I&#39;d heard earlier,&quot; Steven wrote. He half-theorized-half-hoped that whatever he tripped the first time had reset, and that the server might now reboot.

That hunch proved correct, the server resumed operations, and the client declared himself pleased with the situation.

The next day, the client called to report a problem with the new server.

&quot;I pleaded ignorance and went into mental overload and a near nervous breakdown,&quot; Steven told The Register. That response elicited a moment of perhaps accusatory silence.

&quot;The client explained that their managing director fancied himself an amateur IT expert, and expected root and admin passwords to all company systems,&quot; Steven wrote. The exec had exercised his &quot;skills&quot; and managed to take the email server offline.

Steven was then summoned to fix the mess, lock things down, and charge like a wounded bull so the MD learned the consequences of their action.

&quot;With relief, I did what was asked,&quot; Steven wrote. &quot;But I too learned my lesson,&quot; he admitted.

Have you foolishly shorted, tripped, or triggered hardware? If so, let us know by – carefully – clicking here to email us your story so we can feature it in a future edition of Who, Me? ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/capgemini_divests_us_federal_entity_cgs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French consulting and tech services giant Capgemini has decided to offload Capgemini Government Solutions (CGS), the entity it uses for some work with the US government – including a controversial gig assisting immigration authorities.

The company on Sunday issued a brief statement that says it “determined that the customary legal restrictions imposed for contracting with federal government entities carrying out classified activities in the United States did not allow the Group to exercise appropriate control over certain aspects of the operations of this subsidiary to ensure alignment with the Group’s objectives.”

Capgemini will therefore “immediately” commence a divestiture process, a move that won’t cost it much because CGS delivers just 0.4 percent of global revenue and less than two percent of US revenue.

But in recent weeks CGS has been responsible for a huge percentage of Capgemini’s problems, after it won a contract with the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for services described as “Investigation and personal background check services” and contracted by an office named “Detention Compliance And Removals.”

The DHS, ICE, and US Border Patrol are currently conducting operations to find, detain and deport suspect illegal migrants – with a focus on those who have committed crimes, per the policies of the Trump administration.

Those efforts have become controversial as they have sometimes resulted in detention of US citizens, or people lawfully resident in the USA.

Two US citizens who protested the immigration crackdown have died after federal agents used firearms, and those incidents have attracted widespread condemnation and protest. Faced with community anger, President Trump appointed a new leader to oversee operations in the state of Minnesota, and administration officials – some of whom labelled protesters terrorists and said agents acted justifiably in self defense – have queried whether agents involved in one of the shootings followed protocols correctly.

Capgemini’s contract appears to contribute to ICE’s activities, and the company’s CEO Aiman Ezzat last week used his LinkedIn account to comment on the deal.

“The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm,” he wrote.

Ezzat also pointed out that CGS has a structure that means it “operates under a Special Security Agreement, which allows it to work on classified work for the US government and requires separation of its operations from the Capgemini Group.”

In his LinkedIn post, the CEO seemed uncomfortable with that arrangement.

“This creates many restrictions, notably CGS has a board that is controlled by ‘cleared’ independent US directors, decision making is separate, networks are firewalled, and the Capgemini Group cannot access any classified information, classified contracts, or anything relating to the technical operations of CGS, as required by U.S. regulation,” he wrote.

Despite the legal distance between Capgemini and CGS, Ezzat learned “the independent board of directors has already begun the process of reviewing the content and scope of this contract and CGS contracting procedures.”

Ezzat’s LinkedIn post caught the eye of France’s finance minister Roland Lescure who last week told media he felt Capgemini’s CEO should have known about the deal with ICE. Other French lawmakers have protested Capgemini’s involvement with DHS and ICE is inappropriate.

Capgemini slipped out news of its divestiture plans on Sunday.

It is unclear whether divesting CGS means the organization will not use any Capgemini intellectual property or other assets. Nor has Capgemini said if anyone wants to buy CGS, or when a divestiture might happen.

Capgemini’s FY 2024 revenue was €22 billion, so based on Ezzat’s numbers CGS appears to have revenue of around €88 million ($104 million).

The Register offers the following verbiage to Capgemini as it tries to offload the unit: “For Sale – $100 million consultancy, with one large but currently very controversial client, and a very motivated current owner looking to do a deal.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A passionate group of women rediscovered fitness in VR. They’re furious with Mark Zuckerberg for killing their community.

When you picture a virtual reality headset user, you’re probably not picturing someone like Sherry Dickson. At 69, the snowy-haired, retired elementary school teacher hops into her Meta Quest headset five days a week, for roughly 60 to 90 minutes at a time. She’s not attending live concerts or watching immersive films. Dickson, a fitness buff since Jane Fonda workout videos in the ’80s, largely uses her headset for one reason — to play Supernatural, a VR fitness game with a huge, loyal fan base and a tight-knit community.

Supernatural isn’t dead, but it might as well be. A few weeks ago, Meta shut down three VR studios as part of broader layoffs in its Reality Labs division. As a result, Supernatural will no longer get new content. That’s why Dickson is spearheading an online social media campaign to save Supernatural from slowly fading into oblivion.

Supernatural is a mix between a Peloton class and rhythm games like Just Dance or Beat Saber. You swat at targets as they fly toward you, timed to music, inside a picturesque virtual world. You can choose from a library of dance-like Flow workouts, boxing, or even meditative breathing classes. Like any connected fitness game, Supernatural’s stickiness relies on an ever-evolving content library. New music, levels, and choreography keep people hooked because they not only keep things fresh, but strengthen the bond between users and the game’s charismatic coaches.

“Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

For a game like Supernatural, shutting down content production was a death knell that left Dickson and countless other Supernatural fans blindsided with shock, then grief. The Supernatural Facebook page has over 110,000 members, many of whom have written sprawling odes to the game. Over 7,000 and counting have also signed a Change.org petition, begging Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rethink the decision.

Dickson is what your typical Supernatural user looks like. In an emerging tech category with expensive hardware dominated by 18-to-34-year-old men, the majority of Supernatural’s warriors are women, people over 50, and folks with limited mobility. And in the weeks since the news, they’re not staying quiet in their grief.

They’re pissed, and they want Meta to know two things. Not only has the company royally screwed up, but they’re also not letting Supernatural go without a fight.

“My opinion of Meta can be summed up as @*#&&1 $&#^!@ &^#%,” Regina Lynn, a Supernatural athlete in her 50s, tells me in an email. (Athlete is the term the Supernatural community prefers.) Lynn has been playing for five years, roughly three to four times a week. “Mark Zuckerberg helped buy a ballroom for a fascist. Perhaps it is not surprising that he killed Supernatural.”

Lynn is one of several Supernatural fans who reached out to The Verge to say they see a correlation between what’s going on in the world and how Meta has conducted business since acquiring Within, the studio behind the game. Unlike Meta, Within was an independent studio with roots in music videos, feature films, and creative projects. In a Decoder interview, Within cofounder Chris Milk described building Supernatural as “making something that is meaningful to another human being” — something more akin to immersive art than a means to solidify dominance in the VR market. That, in no small part, explains why some fans have reacted so viscerally.

Supernatural was widely considered a successful VR app before Meta ever entered the picture. In fact, when Meta announced it planned to buy it in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission launched a probe to try and block the acquisition — partly because Meta had already acquired Beat Saber, a similar VR game, and Supernatural threatened its dominance. It was also reported that Meta was keen to snap up the game before Apple, which was rumored to be interested in the game. The FTC probe ultimately failed, and the acquisition was completed in 2023.

“This is just a small mirror of a huge problem in our society right now. The blunt way of saying it is those with the gold make the rules. This is what we’re fighting on every single level globally right now,” says Dickson. “We’re fighting those with the money telling us how our lives will be lived, what we can access, what we can do, and what we can say. … Of course there are far bigger things to fight for right now, and I do. But if I don’t take care of my health, my mental health, my physical body? I have nothing to give or fight with for the big causes.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit.”

“I despise Meta along with the oligarchs, the top one percent that continue to destroy our world and kill anything that brings joy and beauty of human experience and connection because their only goal is to make a profit,” agrees DeeDee Henry, an avid Supernatural athlete since 2020. Henry, who has participated in beta testing and user interviews for the app, says she finds it “overwhelming” to convey how much Supernatural’s community has impacted her.

“We have built a community of love and support with each other. We meet each other, we talk, and we form bonds.”

Behind the anger is a community’s palpable loss over the fact that they may lose the very thing that brought them together. To its diehard fans, Supernatural was more than “just a game.” It was a virtual place to prioritize health while making friends. Take Henry and Dickson. A year ago, the two were complete strangers. They were randomly paired together through Supernatural’s Together multiplayer feature, which enables joint workouts, supports voice chat, and allows players to create teams. A year later, Dickson and Henry have formed “Team Sunshine” with Henry’s 75-year-old mother, Darlene “Cookie” Norman, and a fourth friend, Kelly Hines. The four women play five days a week but have yet to all meet in person, with Dickson living in Canada, Henry just outside Los Angeles, Norman in rural California, and Hines in Ohio.

And it’s not just making friends. Marginalized users say Supernatural let them exercise without judgment. Inside the headset, they could lunge, squat, and swipe at targets just like anyone else. They didn’t have to worry about being looked down on for not having six-pack abs, being older, working out in a wheelchair, or having a limited range of movement.

Peruse the Supernatural Facebook group, and you’ll find hundreds of stories like this and more. More than 50 Supernatural athletes reached out to The Verge specifically to share how the game helped them through deep depression, bouts with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, as well as rehabilitation from serious injuries. Some have lost a significant amount of weight, while others say it’s the only form of accessible fitness that keeps them engaged.

“There was no intimidation of gym settings, no time required to drive there, no time limit on when or for how long I could jump in and sweat. Supernatural is the only reason I bought my Quest 2 headset and is the only cardio exercise I do,” says Vickie Bitter, another Supernatural athlete in her 50s. “It is literally the only thing I use on it every single day.”

“I can’t move my ankle, I can’t stand up on my toes or anything,” says Jennifer Boyer, a longtime Supernatural athlete who needs ankle-foot orthotics, a type of brace that goes from the bottom of the foot to the knee. For Boyer, maintaining core strength is a necessity while using the braces to prevent injury. Unfortunately, Boyer didn’t like gyms because she felt self-conscious and found repetitive strength routines boring. As a result, she struggled to find a workout that would stick.

Supernatural appealed to Boyer because the choreography in the game’s Flow workouts kept movements fresh. In these levels, different types of triangles fly toward users to signal whether they should squat or lean into side lunges. They’re interspersed with teardrop-shaped balls pointed in different directions, signaling where they should swing their arms. Users with limb differences can also pick a wheelchair mode, choose single-handed play, or adjust settings to accommodate their mobility needs.

“I hurt so much after the first day because I wouldn’t stop playing. It was so much fun. You’re doing squats and side lunges — I can’t do traditional lunges where you step forward and drop a knee to the ground. But with Supernatural, I love the Flow workouts because I feel more like I’m dancing,” Boyer explains.

“I introduce many of my patients to VR. I have a pretty high take rate, meaning that they like it and enjoy it as an intervention,” says Jeanna Duryee, a physical therapist. “In Alaska, I’m fighting depression, deconditioning, and seasonal [affective] disorder at a higher rate [than] in other areas. Supernatural gave me a tool to use to get people that I never seen smile, smile broadly while exercising. I see people that say they hate exercise and hate gyms, but they love Supernatural.”

The fervent devotion among Supernatural fans is reminiscent of another connected fitness platform: Peloton. Like Peloton users, Supernatural athletes have to invest in niche hardware. But a major difference is that Peloton is an independent company whose sole purpose is maintaining and improving on a single platform. Meta may have invested (and lost) billions in VR and the metaverse over the years, but it’s notably shifted gears toward its AI. And where Peloton fans love the company, Supernatural fans strongly feel Meta fumbled a rising star.

Given the game’s popularity and Meta’s ambitions to dominate the VR market, one might think it’d be a no-brainer to invest in Supernatural. But according to Boyer, Dickson, and dozens of other Supernatural fans, the decline in quality was undeniable once Meta acquired Supernatural. Not just in terms of features, but also in community support.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.’ It wasn’t long after Meta bought it that they stopped having the extra features they said they would have,” says Boyer, a longtime Supernatural beta tester before and after Meta’s acquisition.

“When Meta said they were going to buy it, everyone was like, ‘Oh my god, kiss of death.’”

Prior to the acquisition, Boyer says you could tune into video calls with Supernatural coaches. While athletes couldn’t speak to them directly, they could type in the chat and receive personalized shoutouts and responses. After the acquisition, those opportunities slowed down. Instead of directly hopping into chats with coaches, fans were limited to seeing videos and hoping the algorithm would surface their comments on coaches’ posts. Boyer asserts that compared to the original owners, Meta never took an interest in getting feedback on new features either.

“There was a new workout every day, and then they started doing new workouts once a week. Then they fired all the user experience people who were managing, pulling together those fun things with the coaches. Then there were no more beta group chats,” laments Boyer, noting that soon there were no new backdrops for the game.“Other app developers should take note of how capriciously Meta fought for, then ditched Supernatural. If you make something you love, you might make a pile of money selling it to Meta, but they’re likely to mismanage and kill it,” adds Matt Krzycki, an early adopter of Supernatural.

But for many vocal Supernatural fans, the most painful part of Meta’s neglect wasn’t the slow decay of the platform or the lack of new content. The ultimate betrayal is how the company has treated the creative team behind the game, particularly the coaches. In nearly every interview, Supernatural fans told The Verge that the Supernatural coaches’ openness and vulnerability helped make the platform stand out among the competition. For them, the coaches weren’t people inside the headset. They were friends and family.

“It wasn’t like when they cancel your favorite show, and you feel bad for everyone in the production and hope the actors get new roles. Instead, these were six people who I personally spent half an hour with almost every day for almost a year,” says Erica Carter, speaking of the Supernatural coaches. “So when they were laid off, when they posted videos trying to be strong and supportive, putting the community first — gosh, it hurts. I cried.”

The love for the coaches isn’t hyperbole. When coach Leanne Pendante’s husband died, the entire community rallied around her with an outpouring of love and support. Now that the community is suffering, the coaches are returning the favor.

“Yes, I did get laid off and it was very difficult because (a) I wasn’t expecting it and (b) this Supernatural community, if you have not met them, they are incredible and they just swallow you with so much love and I just wanted to stay there forever,” coach Mindy Lai shared on Instagram.

“Apologies for not hopping on earlier in the week once all the news broke, but, you know, I got a family to provide for, so once everything happened I had to put my feet to the concrete and hit the streets and start making moves,” says coach Antonio “Doc” Harrison in an Instagram post. “I am so grateful, so honored and humbled to have been a small part of your journey.”

“There have been a couple of times where I’m like, ‘I want to get in! I just want to get in and do a workout, a group workout, let’s see who’s in there.’ And it’s hard,” coach Mark Harari says in a recently posted video, trying to motivate discouraged Supernatural users to put their headsets back on.

“We’re still here, okay? We haven’t left. All the coaches, we’re still here. … We’re still a part of this community, we’re here still to love, and support, and to raise up, and to stand by your side when things are tough.”

When reached for comment, Meta declined to address the backlash it has since received from the community or plans for the future. Instead, spokesperson Johanna Peace pointed to several new features and content Meta released after the acquisition, including a price drop in the subscription, a multiplayer mode, and new artists series and collaborations.

But barring a reversal in its decision, there’s little Meta can say to comfort Supernatural fans. Every single fan who spoke with The Verge has said their trust in the company has been shattered. For most, it’s a matter of picking which is the lesser evil moving forward.

On Reddit and the Facebook group, some have already posted screenshots of canceling their subscriptions. Others, like Dickson, are trying to rally Supernatural fans to create a grassroots movement that could save the game. Of those who spoke to The Verge, everyone said they’d stick with Supernatural until they can’t any longer. For most, the biggest source of anxiety is the music, as no one trusts Meta will renew licenses once they’ve run out. Once that happens, they fear workouts will begin disappearing, creating holes within the existing content library. Asked about alternatives, the most common response is, “There’s nothing else like Supernatural out there.”

“I’m torn because I don’t want to give Meta another penny. They don’t deserve it,” says Boyer, who invested in three Meta Quest headsets, along with several straps and accessories. “The corporation as a whole does not care about the people who use it. That’s the message I got from them and as a result, I will never buy those glasses, their watch, or any of the other things they’re trying to develop.”

Pieter Montoulieu is taking a different approach. After five years of playing Supernatural, Montoulieu decided to channel his grief into creating a Supernatural-like prototype game for the Apple Vision Pro. Montoulieu says he’s already been hit up by avid Supernatural fans interested in testing and creating custom workouts. Asked why the Vision Pro and not the Quest, Montoulieu says that “shutting down one of the only Meta services that actually made me feel healthier was kind of the last straw.”

For Dickson, the bare minimum that she wants from her campaign to save Supernatural is for the program to remain on Meta’s servers with no disappearing songs or workouts.

“What I’d really like to see is an investor — someone of vision — to come along and possibly buy the rights of Supernatural and make it independent again,” says Dickson. Ideally, she says that’d mean rehiring the creative team, and not just the coaches and choreographers. “Maybe on a different platform that’s supportive, like Steam. Where this program stays alive and continues to be guided by the Creative Vision of the people that made it in the first place.”

Through a spokesperson, Chris Milk declined to comment.

The mood in the Supernatural Facebook group is a picture in the five stages of grief. Right now, it’s between denial and incandescent anger. Frustration with Meta (and colorful insults for Zuckerberg) sits directly alongside hope that this isn’t truly the end. Supernatural coaches still pop in to post motivational videos, challenging users to venture back into their headsets and take heart in the community, existing content library, and their shared experiences.

“People are telling me I’m nuts and I’m going, ‘No, no. I will not give up.’ It’ll take the coaches reaching out to me to say, ‘We don’t want you to do this, Sherry.’ But they’re not,” Dickson says.

For now, Dickson is hoping to stir up the community’s fighting spirit. To get them believing that Meta can be shamed into doing the right thing and preserve the app. Or perhaps signal that a dedicated community is still there for potential buyers. After all, Dickson says, Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel after a week of public pressure — who’s to say it’s impossible?

It’s possible Supernatural will miraculously get a second life. More likely, it’ll end up as another casualty of Meta’s shifting ambitions. But, among the hundreds of forum comments and over 50 interviews I’ve conducted, perhaps this sentiment from Supernatural fan Sherer Minor sums it up best.

“I hope the app, in whatever form I can get it, never truly goes away. In the meantime, I’ll keep logging in and punching the air, because punching people is frowned upon.”</div>

Emails claim Gates’ contracted an STD and wanted to ‘surreptitiously’ give Melinda antibiotics.

Reports of Bill Gates’ connections with Jeffrey Epstein grow more lurid with each dump of documents from the Department of Justice. The latest includes somewhat confusing emails that Epstein may have been drafting on behalf of someone named Boris, who worked at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The messages claim that Bill contracted an STD and wanted to “surreptitiously” give Melinda antibiotics. It also claims that Bill had “trysts” with married women and “Russian girls.”

In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Bill Gates said:

“These claims are absolutely absurd and completely false. The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein’s frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.”

It’s unclear who the Boris referenced in the emails is, or if the messages were ever sent to anyone. Only Epstein is listed in the to and from fields.

Gates’ relationship with Epstein has become a major issue for the billionaire philanthropist. He initially downplayed his connections, but documents have suggested the two were closer than Gates admitted. He has repeatedly denied associating with Epstein outside of fundraising and philanthropic efforts and said their meetings were a “huge mistake.” However, Melinda Gates has stated that Bill’s association with Epstein played a role in her decision to file for divorce.

            <div id="article-text">Internet shutdowns, smuggled Starlink terminals, and state-sponsored AI slop.

After protests broke out in early January, the Iranian regime shut down the internet, starting the longest blackout in Iranian history. Despite this attempt to stop the protests from spreading, they did not stop. Still, the internet shutdown slowed down the spread of information both inside and outside Iran.

Behind the heavily policed borders and the jammed signals, an unprecedented wave of state violence continues to add to a death toll somewhere between 3,000 and 30,000. Even at the lowest count, which has been acknowledged by the Iranian state and is likely a wild underestimate, these last few weeks have been one of the bloodiest uprisings in modern history.

The situation in Iran can be hard to grasp. The history is complicated; the state of the technology and internet infrastructure there is constantly in flux. To get a sense of what is happening right now, I turned to an expert. Mahsa Alimardani, the associate director of the Technology Threats & Opportunities program at WITNESS, has been a researcher and advocate in the digital rights space — particularly around Iran — since 2012. I spoke with her about what is happening in Iran, and how technology both props up and threatens repressive regimes.

The Verge: What is internet access in Iran like right now?

Mahsa Alimardani: Since the weekend [of January 24], there has been some resumption of connectivity. And I’m a little bit worried that this might convince people that things are back to normal. Last I saw, there was like 30 to 40 percent connectivity on some of the Cloudflare network data in Iran and there’s very inconsistent connectivity. Some circumvention tools have started to work.

Randomly, someone in Iran FaceTime called me yesterday. They were like, “My VPN stopped working, so I just tried to call with FaceTime, and for some reason, it didn’t even need a VPN.” But it was a momentary glitch. Various things are happening across the network, and it’s not really clear why there’s this opening, or what it means for long-term connectivity.

Since January 8th, when there was a surge in the uprising in the protest movement in Iran, there was an internet shutdown — the longest internet shutdown in Iran, they broke the record in length.

They also broke the record in number of protesters that have been massacred. It’s horrifying to think that technology helps enable such crimes.

Why does the Iranian government fear internet access?

In 1988, there was a fatwa where the government massacred a lot of political prisoners in a short span of time. I bring this up because it happened when there was no internet, and the media was heavily controlled and centralized by the state. If you did not flee Iran, and if you were not part of the generation of prisoners and political activists that survived, it was very hard to pass on the memory of that event. Peers of mine in Iran didn’t grow up with the same information. It’s so interesting having these conversations with people and realizing they are learning history only when they leave the country.

What’s been a real game changer is the way you can document and witness these kinds of crimes in the age of the internet. I think it’s obviously a big threat to the regime. It’s a massive threat to them to be able to hold them accountable, and be able to document and witness what they’re doing.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence. In 2019 there was a week-long internet shutdown, under the blanket of which they massacred 1,500 people. The reason why is because they don’t want people to use the internet for mobilization and communication, and they don’t want there to be a way to document what’s happening.

Anytime anyone sees a severe crackdown like an internet shutdown, you know that it’s going to be followed by violence

So the denial of the scale of their crimes is part of what they do in Iran, because it’s very hard to assess the percentage of legitimacy that the regime has, because obviously you can’t do free polling. You don’t have free media. Even when you have foreign journalists that go there, they’re followed by minders and the reporting is super-limited. The UN hasn’t been able to really have anyone do proper site visits for human rights documentation, since the start of this regime in 1979.

There isn’t any real access to professional on-the-ground documentation and fact-finding. So it all really depends on the internet, on people, on citizen media. People sending things, putting them online, and then having professional fact-checkers and verification.

What was internet access in Iran like most recently? What platforms and service providers did people use before the blackout started?

Iranians are extremely tech savvy because there’s been a cat-and-mouse game across the internet for most of its existence. Since 2017, 2018, on average, there’s been protests every two years. Each time they have a different level of censorship, new kinds of rules and regulations.

In 2017, [messaging app] Telegram was massive. Some people were even saying Telegram was the internet for Iranians, they were doing everything across Telegram. It worked really well, especially with network bandwidth being really low. So Telegram was a place for news, chatting, socializing everything, even like online markets. But then they blocked it in 2018 when protests started, because protest mobilization on there was a threat to the regime.

There was a move toward Instagram and WhatsApp becoming the most popular applications.

They had yet to be blocked back then. Instagram was more for fun, but it became much more politicized after Telegram was blocked. Then, during the Woman Life Freedom movement in 2022, Instagram and WhatsApp got blocked.

The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs

Most people are just on VPNs. The regime has spent a lot of effort in trying to disable VPNs. There’s a lot of different VPN projects both for-profit and nonprofit that work within that cat-and-mouse game where protocols are being disabled and new ones are created.

An average Iranian often has many different VPNs. When one can’t work, they’ll turn on another one.

We’ve talked about how technology threatens the regime and how average Iranians use it. Let’s switch over to the other side of this issue: how does technology enable repression?

So there’s various different things the regime does, different levels of enacting information controls. There’s the censorship level of shutting it down.

Then there’s physical coercion. Like, I know people who have not reported their children who have been killed recently because they were so frightened by the process by which they had to get their loved one’s body.

They also flood the information space with a lot of misinformation. They create a lot of doubt.

They’ve been doing this information manipulation even before the internet. Iran is a very complicated information space. There are a lot of actors beyond the regime who also want to manipulate it. Even authentic dissidents and activism will get lumped in with Mossad or CIA operations.

In 1953, the American CIA and British MI6 overthrew the democratic government of Iran, consolidating power under a monarchy that was more favorable to the US and the UK. Many believe that the political instability caused by the CIA and MI6 eventually led to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which established the current authoritarian regime.

From 2014 to 2024, Iran and Russia joined a strategic partnership with the Syrian dictatorship as part of the Syrian civil war. The United States formed its own coalition; both coalitions purported to fight ISIS. The civil war spawned massive amounts of internet disinformation, and in 2018, Facebook and Twitter deleted hundreds of accounts originating in Russia and Iran that formed a global influence network pushing disinformation. The Syrian regime was overthrown at the end of 2024. The next year, following decades of hostilities, Israel and Iran engaged in a 12-day war.

These are some, but not all of the factors that contribute to the complicated information space in Iran that Alimardani is referring to.

The regime’s campaign existed pre-internet, but with technology, it went into overdrive. They’ve been quite clever in some of the ways they’ve covered the protests. They’ve been able to even mobilize, like, people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, against, you know, the Iranian cause for liberation.

There have been a lot of documented efforts of them trying to manipulate protest documentation, undermine it, you know, use the concept of the Liar’s Dividend, which is very easy to use in the increasingly AI world we’re in.

Hold on, can you go through those examples you just mentioned? About mobilizing people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause?

Yeah, so, Iran is quite complicated in that it’s an Islamic fascist state. They use Islam in a lot of ways to repress the people. And there is a lot of very valid rhetoric about Islamophobia in the West, from the very specific context and history of the United States, such as what happened during the War on Terror.

But in Iran, it’s quite different. And this can really be manipulated and conflated, right? Mosques in Iran are often also the headquarters for the Basij [the Iranian paramilitary corps], and people might not know this. So there will be videos like, “Look at these protesters who are setting fire to this mosque. Look at these Islamophobic rioters.”

You might see that, without the context that the mosques also are places where the security forces that kill people are stationed, and lose why something like that would be attacked by Iranians seeking liberation.

You mentioned the regime’s use of AI — do you want to talk a little bit more about that?

Yeah, so, we didn’t need AI for authoritarian regimes to deny evidence of their crimes. Even before AI, Bashir al-Assad [the former dictator of Syria] was saying that reliable documentation of his crimes in Syria were not valid.

Whether we like it or not, AI is being integrated into a lot of things. AI editing is slowly becoming ubiquitous. Like, in fact, we might come to a point where editing photos or anything might become unavoidable without the use of generative AI.

So you no longer have that binary of like, if it’s AI, it’s fake. If there’s no AI, it’s real.

So there’s this very symbolic image that everyone has said reminded them of the Tiananmen Square Tank Man from 1989. But here, a protester is standing in front of armed security forces on motorcycles with weapons. [Ed. note: The New York Post ran with the headline “Powerful image of lone Iranian protester in front of security forces draws parallels to Tiananmen Square ‘Tank Man.’”]

This was a very low resolution video taken from a high rise [building]. Someone had screenshotted a frame from the video and it was quite blurry.

They used some AI editing software to enhance it, and you could see some AI artifacts. Nevertheless, this is an authentic, verified image of a brave protester. Lots of credible sources have verified it. But immediately, it was pointed out to have these AI artifacts, and a lot of the regime accounts started this narrative of “This is all AI slop from Zionists.”

And of course, because, you know, Israel has a special interest in Iran, they have a Farsi-language state account. Israel’s Farsi state account shared the image, which further fueled the claim that this authentic image from Iran was AI slop being pushed by the enemy, Israel.

As you’ve already mentioned, Iran has a complicated information environment. What would you say are the various actors in this space? What kinds of things are they doing?

Obviously there are foreign policy interests by Israel and the US in Iran, just because of the history and very antagonistic relationship they’ve had from the very beginning of the revolution.

The Iran-Israel war in June 2025 was a super interesting moment because the war started a few weeks after Google launched Veo 3, which has made access to very realistic generative AI content very easy. So right off the bat, you could see, from both sides, a lot of AI content coming from the war. This wasn’t the first war where that’s happened — like the Ukraine war has had so many different examples — but since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine [beginning in 2022], the technology has advanced far more, so it became a very big part of the narrative of the situation in Iran.

The most famous example from the Iran-Israel war was a piece of manipulated content that Citizen Lab later was able to attribute to the Israeli state. It was this AI-generated video of Israel bombing the gates of Evin Prison, perpetuating this narrative that they have very precise military operations and that they were freeing these political prisoners.

Evin is a very famous prison for a lot of activists and dissidents and intellectuals in Iran. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called the bombing of Evin Prison a war crime. And indeed, political prisoners were casualties of the bombing.

But that deepfaked video went viral. Mainstream media even reposted it immediately before a lot of various different researchers, including our deepfakes rapid response force and others, were able to attest that indeed this was a manipulated video.

So you have this information space that is quite complicated. But in this scenario, I think it would really be remiss to put that much emphasis on the role that these other actors have. There are things from these outside actors that fog up the information space, but ultimately what’s really happening is that there’s a really unprecedented massacre happening. And the perpetrator is the Islamic Republic of Iran.

I’ve seen some reporting about how Iranians bought Starlink terminals prior to the blackout. Can you say anything about that?

Yeah, I want to start by referencing a really great article by the Sudanese activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied, called “Sudanese People Don’t Have the Luxury of Hating Elon Musk.” Whatever my personal ideas are about Elon Musk, you have to give credit where credit is due. This technology is a game changer. It’s been a game changer in Sudan. And it has been in Iran.

We’ve had a few days of a little bit of connectivity of people coming online just through the ordinary network, but when the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran.

When the shutdown was full and complete, Starlink was really the only window we had into Iran

And if you talk to documentation organizations, they’ll tell you, they were getting evidence and doing the verification through what was coming in from the Starlink connections. I know of people who had a Starlink and had like a whole neighborhood of people come in to check in and use the Wi-Fi.

The most credible stats before the situation was that there’s about 50,000 Starlinks. There’s likely more than 56,000 now. It became very popular during the Iran-Israel War, because of course, then the Islamic Republic enacted another shutdown. A lot of people invested in getting Starlink then.

You can get anything you want in Iran through smugglers — I think Starlink was like $1,000 at the time because demand was so high. Receivers are ordinarily a few hundred US dollars. The last price I heard was they were being sold for $2,000 in Iran. It’s a lot of money, but given the demand and the massive risk the smugglers have to undertake, I think it’s fair, but also, it means you can’t really scale this, and the people that have it are very privileged or have access to very privileged people.

What we’re seeing is a very small window. When having discussions with various folks that have been doing firsthand documentation, they’ve expressed, “We’re not getting enough from Kurdistan. We’re not getting enough documentation from Sistan and Baluchestan.” Historically, these areas are often at the forefront of protests, because the regime often has the bloodiest forms of repression in these provinces with marginalized ethnicities. Areas like Sistan and Baluchestan have a lot of economic poverty, so they’d have less access to something privileged like Starlink.

Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity

For all these years, myself, many people, have been working on this concept of internet censorship and internet shutdowns. And there really hasn’t been a way to reimagine this system. There’s this concept of digital sovereignty in place in terms of internet access and internet infrastructure that fits within national borders. In even the most democratic of countries, this is still national infrastructure that the government can have access or forms of control over.

This concept has to be broken. Satellite internet is really this way of reimagining connectivity, not just for Iran, but anywhere where lack of connectivity results in a crisis, whether humanitarian one, or a massacre of this proportion.

It’s really important to reconceive access to satellite internet in a way that could scale beyond those who are privileged and beyond those willing to take the risk. And one of the ideas that I’ve had and have been working on with other colleagues at Access Now has been to push for direct-to-cell access, which is a form of satellite internet connectivity that depends on technology that exists in phones created from 2020 onwards. We launched this campaign called Direct 2 Cell, hoping to push forward this concept.

On a personal note, how are you doing? Have you heard from your friends, family, other people you know in Iran recently?

I’ve been able to be in touch with some of my family and others here and there.

I also had that random FaceTime audio call from another person I know. I was very worried about them because they’ve been at the protests. I had heard through various people that they were okay, but I finally heard from them firsthand, and it was such a bizarre experience, speaking to them.

I had never heard them sound the way that they sounded: recounting their experience of leaving the protest before the military tanks came to open fire on the crowds, how they got tear gassed, and for the next few days, seeing water hoses washing blood off the streets. It sounded like they were making a lot of dark jokes — I had never heard them sound this way. I don’t know how you can walk the streets of your neighborhood, seeing people wash off blood, and just…. like, something not fundamentally change in your mind.

I just, I don’t, I can’t imagine how to process it if I was there. As someone in the diaspora, it’s hard to process being privileged and being away.

Before it turned into an ’80s-inspired pop project, the band had more in common with Mogwai.

New York City got hit with a hell of a snowstorm last week. And, inevitably, when I’m watching the snow fall, wandering the oddly quiet streets after dark, people hiding inside and staying warm, I put on M83’s sophomore record, Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts.

Before Nicolas Fromageau left the band and Anthony Gonzalez embraced traditional pop song structures, saxophone solos, and teen angst, M83 released two albums of mostly instrumental music. The self-titled debut album is kind of forgettable, but the second one finds the French duo taking inspiration from the repetitive bombast of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Dead Cities is a decidedly French twist on post-rock grandeur, building blankets of sound from drum machines, analog synths, and heavily compressed guitar.

There’s a sense of liminality to Dead Cities, an uncanny atmosphere that lives up to its name. Listening to the gently repeating melody of “Be Wild” as the track slowly accumulates layers, it’s impossible not to imagine walking through a once bustling city that now lies freshly abandoned. “America” captures the panic of The Twilight Zone’s “Where Is Everybody?” as frantic drums, My Bloody Valentine-esque guitar, and uneasy synths build to an early crescendo.

You can tell something is wrong from moment one, though. The record opens with “Birds,” a 54-second chant:

The computerized voice is initially bathed in digital distortion, slowly resolving into a soothing tone that inherently feels untrustworthy. There is no sun. There are no birds. And there are no flowers. The album opens by lying to you before launching into highlight “Unrecorded.”

“Unrecorded” feels like the mission statement for the record. Analog arpeggios, driving drums, droney guitars, manipulated vocals, and cinematic synth strings all combine in a wall of snow-bound sound. Listening to tracks like this, it’s shocking that another 10 years for Hollywood to enlist M83 to score a film (2013’s Oblivion).

M83 would eventually go on to record shoegaze-indebted retro pop, scoring hits like “Kim & Jessie” and the absolutely inescapable “Midnight City.” But before that, the group explored something more cinematic and open-ended.

Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts is available on Bandcamp and most streaming platforms, including Apple Music, YouTube Music, Qobuz, Deezer, and Spotify.

With buttons instead of a touchscreen, the Xteink X4 can be a challenge to use, but a growing community is fixing that.

I’ve used and reviewed dozens of e-readers over the years, but the 5-inch Kobo Mini remains my favorite for one simple reason: It was small. While it lacked useful features like screen lighting and page turn buttons, its size made it an e-reader I actually wanted to carry every day. The $69 Xteink X4 e-reader is even smaller than the Kobo Mini and E Ink smartphones like Boox Palma. It’s satisfyingly pocketable but also frustratingly unintuitive and functionally limited out of the box. That could be a deal-breaker were it not for a growing community of users working to improve it.

Like the Kodak Charmera, I was pleasantly surprised at how small the X4 is in person. Its 4.3-inch E Ink screen is only a bit tinier than the Kobo Mini’s 5-inch panel, but the X4’s bezels are much slimmer, making the e-reader feel significantly smaller. The joy of nerding out over the X4’s size was quickly cut short when I tested one of its most compelling features.

When the X4 was announced last December, Xteink shared photos of the e-reader stuck to the back of an iPhone using its MagSafe feature. It made the X4 seem like a better alternative to e-reader cases for those wanting a second screen on their phones, but the odd position of its magnets makes it impossible to stick the e-reader to the back of my iPhone 16 Pro in any usable way.

It’s an issue that many X4 users have complained about, and in a statement emailed to The Verge, the company explains that “during our early development and testing phase, we worked with a limited range of iPhone models. As a result, on some newer models, the magnetic alignment may not appear perfectly centered.” As a work-around, Xteink includes a pair of magnetic adhesive rings that can be stuck to devices to allow for proper alignment.

However, the X4 also extends past the bottom of my iPhone, so instead of trying to awkwardly use the two together, I’ve been using it as a standalone ultra-compact e-reader. At less than 6mm thick, the X4 takes up very little room in the sling bag I carry every day and is protected using a basic magnetic folio-style case that’s included.

The Xteink X4 is one of the cheapest e-readers on the market, but that price comes with some challenges and compromises, including a 4.3-inch E Ink screen with a 220ppi resolution. That’s less than the 300ppi e-paper screens on the latest Kindle and Kobo e-readers. You’ll see jagged edges on fine text if you look hard enough, but it’s enough resolution for a pleasant reading experience.

There’s also no screen lighting, so if you’re planning to read before bed, you’ll need a lamp or a flashlight. The lack of a touchscreen is more frustrating. The X4 features several buttons on its right edge and below its display. They’re not labeled, and their functionality varies depending on where you are in the UI.

Further complicating matters, three of the buttons are two-sided and do different things depending on which side you press. It’s frustrating to try and remember which side of which button you need to press to make a selection, jump back to a previous screen, or simply navigate a list of options. And it’s not helped by the X4’s limited and confusing software.

While Boox’s smartphone-size E Ink Palma devices run Android and let you do everything from watching videos to playing games, the X4 is solely focused on reading, with support limited to TXT and EPUB files, plus images like JPGs and BMPs, which I had limited success loading. There’s no built-in bookstore so you’ll need to source your own DRM-free EPUB files. That’s a little easier now, thanks to Amazon recently expanding support for EPUBs, but just getting ebooks onto the X4 feels harder than it could be.

The e-reader doesn’t mount as a storage device when connected to a computer, and while you’re supposed to be able to wirelessly upload files from a browser over Wi-Fi or your phone, I didn’t have much success in getting that to work. The easiest way is to copy files to a memory card using a USB reader, but that is needlessly complicated by the X4’s microSD card slot that makes inserting and ejecting a memory card difficult without long nails or a paper clip.

Reading ebooks is an okay experience, and I’m always a fan of dedicated page turn buttons. But if you’re familiar with a Kobo or Kindle, you’ll find yourself sorely missing options for adjusting text formatting. You only get two font-size choices, three line spacing options, and no way to increase the margins around text. Images and illustrations in ebooks are simply not displayed, most text formatting is ignored, and while you’re supposed to be able to load and use your own font files, it’s another finicky feature I had no success with.

You can jump to different chapters, pages, and bookmarks, or turn on features like auto page turns at set intervals, but doing so requires opening and navigating a series of menus using the X4’s buttons. It feels unnecessarily complicated. It’s an experience you’ll eventually get marginally comfortable with, but not one you’ll ever enjoy.

Xteink has already released several software updates improving the X4’s UI and usability. Progress has been slow, but because the company hasn’t locked down the e-reader, a growing community has taken it upon itself to improve the X4. Installing CrossPoint Reader on the X4, an open-source alternative firmware, was a simple process that immediately solved many of the pain points of Xteink’s software. CrossPoint simplifies the X4’s UI, expands the options for how ebooks look, and adds onscreen labels for what each button does. It’s also easy to uninstall, but I don’t think I’m ever going to.

The X4 will never replace the Kobo Libra 2 I use for most of my reading. A touchscreen, lighting, access to a robust ebook store, and a UI that doesn’t have me pulling my hair out are features I can’t do without. But over the past few weeks, I haven’t left the house without the tiny X4. It’s a welcome alternative to my phone (that always seems full of bad news) if I have a few minutes to while away, despite its frustrations. I don’t like recommending devices that require third-party upgrades to be “fixed,” but the work being done by the X4 community makes the e-reader worth considering if pocketability — and a little tinkering — is your priority.

            <div id="article-text">How much does a human touch matter when it comes to a latte? It depends.

In Seattle, the only thing we love more than coffee is our coffee shops.

On a six-block walk I pass at least a half dozen, each with their own vibe: one focused on chai, another inside a yoga studio, a Starbucks that’s surprisingly busy for late afternoon downtown. I passed them all up to get to one shop in particular, where a barista named Jarvis would address me by name and make me a thoroughly decent latte with rose-flavored syrup — nothing out of the ordinary in Seattle. But Jarvis, unlike the other baristas keeping the city’s many shops humming, is a robot.

Hill7 is a luxury apartment building located between the courthouse, the convention center, and a bunch of surface streets that function as an extended I-5 on-ramp. It’s at the center of it all, and also nowhere in particular. To get there, I walk past vacant storefronts with graffitied signs advertising prime retail space, and also an Amazon Go store that looked deserted from the outside. Amazon would announce its imminent closure the next day.

The robot barista resides in a large stand in the Hill7 lobby, sharing space with a place that sells sushi by the pound. There’s a not-unpleasant soy sauce and seaweed smell in the air as I place my order on an iPad. Jarvis isn’t a full humanoid robot, nor is it a glorified vending machine. Jarvis is a robotic arm made by a Seattle-based company called Artly, and is positioned within reach of a customized La Marzocco espresso machine. It “talks” over a loudspeaker, directing customers to order on the tablet and complimenting their choice of beverage when they do.

For the most part, it does all the things human baristas do — grabbing a cup, moving the portafilter from the espresso machine to the grinder and back again, pouring latte art. It doesn’t have to go as far as pressing buttons or pulling levers to start grinding beans or brewing the espresso thanks to some behind-the-scenes automation, but as it makes my drink, it goes through a lot of motions I’m quite familiar with.

I was horrified to learn that the company wanted me to actually talk to the customers while I made their coffee

I got my first barista job during college, and during training I was horrified to learn that the company wanted me to actually talk to the customers while I made their coffee. Not only did I have to learn a new set of skills and memorize a bunch of drink recipes, I had to swallow my social anxiety and make small talk with people who didn’t really want to be talking to me? An actual nightmare. But I tried anyway, and at times I had to focus so hard on the social aspect that I completely screwed up the coffee bit. I still think about the new dad who came in and carefully specified decaf for his order — I got so caught up in making small talk that I gave him a beverage with three fully caffeinated shots of espresso.

Later I did a stint at an artisanal gelato shop where the owner took deep pride in running a serious coffee program and didn’t mandate small talk. I learned how to dial in espresso, how to make a pour-over (not nearly as simple as the name implies). I was also in the messiest part of my 20s, going through my first breakup and in a not-unrelated incident, showing up to work so hungover that the owner took me aside, visibly worried, and asked if I was okay. He thought I was having some kind of breakdown; I told him I just got too drunk the night before.

Jarvis, on the other hand, has never shown up hungover, or late, or sweating from the six-block walk to get to work. Jarvis stays right where it is when the shop closes at 3PM. I also paid a visit to Artly’s location near Pike Place Market, where Jarvis is flanked by two other robotic arms: Amanda and Ponyo. At both locations, the robot baristas are overseen by a human. In one instance, the human assistant had to refill a tank of milk when it ran empty while making my drink. They also wiped up some drops of spilled milk on the counter in front of Jarvis. But mostly, the human Artly employee seems to sit alone scrolling on their phone while the robots repeat a greeting message on loop, despite a lack of customers.

I’d met Jarvis before. Weeks earlier at CES, I was in a line at the Las Vegas Convention Center Starbucks that looked to be about 40 minutes long. I typed the word “coffee” in the CES app vendor search, and wouldn’t you know, Artly had a booth just a short walk away. I envisioned a machine churning out mediocre coffee with silly custom latte art. I was, to be quite honest, sure I would not like it. I was wrong.

Jarvis, so Artly says, is trained on the movements of a specific human barista: Joe Yang, head of Artly’s coffee program and a US Coffee Championship winner in 2023. It mimics his movements as it makes each drink, which takes about three minutes according to the company (and confirmed by my own experience). Jarvis uses AI to make adjustments as needed on the fly, narrating aloud things like “there are no grounds in the portafilter” when it encounters something unexpected. The drinks it has made for me — a cappuccino at CES, the aforementioned rose latte, and a plain latte — have been good to very good. Certainly better than I expected from a nonhuman barista, and honestly better than the kind of drink I would typically get from a human-operated cafe that serves but doesn’t specialize in espresso drinks.

Jarvis, Joe Yang, and hundreds of human baristas across Seattle have all mastered one particularly crucial task in making an espresso drink: steaming milk properly. To make a great latte or cappuccino, you first need to create tiny bubbles by bringing the steam wand just barely above the surface of the milk, and then let the steam create a vortex in the milk pitcher to mix this “micro foam” into a unified texture. Milk that has been properly steamed looks like wet paint. You can’t replicate it by heating the milk and then whipping it around with a frothing tool. You’ll know you’re in for a bad latte if you hear the steam wand screaming against the sides of a milk pitcher, a sure sign that no texture is being created. Proper steaming is as quiet as a whisper.

I made a lot of bad lattes before I learned the right way; it certainly wasn’t part of the training at my corporate coffee gig. But that was mostly beside the point at a shop where most people either wanted some variation on a mocha or a drip coffee, black, as fast as they could get it. The espresso machines at that job did most of the work for us, too. All I really had to do was keep the bean hopper topped up and push the right button to pull a double shot of espresso.

My old boss at the gelato shop mentioned once that staffing was the hardest part of his job as a small business owner. Hiring, training, managing schedules, inevitably training new workers as people left. That job was the most physically demanding I’d ever had, and truthfully I wasn’t a very good employee. But watching the owner work seven days a week year-round, covering shifts when one of us called off unexpectedly, watching his investment go down the drain in a very literal sense when I mindlessly started rinsing out a pan of freshly prepared sorbetto (a real thing that happened!) — I understood what he meant. People are hard.

Giant corporations seem to agree. Starbucks headquarters is about 3 miles south of Artly’s Hill7 shop. I used to bike there often to visit the Reserve Roastery located on the first floor, which was welcoming and always busy. The Reserve was Starbucks’ best impression of a fancy third-wave coffee shop, with a more focused menu and a real sit-down-and-stay vibe, and I never got a bad latte there.

Starbucks abruptly shuttered it last fall, identifying it vaguely as one of many closed or soon-to-be-closed stores where the company was “unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don’t see a path to financial performance.” The barista workforce at that Reserve and one across town in Capitol Hill happened to be unionized; the company denies this had any influence on its decision to close the stores.

My barista career ended decades ago, but it still feels like a core part of my identity as a worker, and maybe even as a human. Sure, I learned how to make a damn good latte, but I also learned discipline — not to mention the consequences you face in its absence. I learned how to make small talk even when I just wanted to keep my head down. I learned how terrible it feels to come to work after getting wasted the night before, and never did it again. I learned how to screw up, badly, and pick up and keep going because people are depending on you. I wasn’t the ideal employee; I was human.

My most pessimistic view on Jarvis is as a neat replacement for the human tendency to be human. Robot baristas don’t make the wrong drink. They don’t need breaks. They don’t unionize. They’re predictable, reliable, and honestly, capable of making a better latte than I made in my button-pushing corporate coffee job. They’d be easier to manage in a hundred different ways. But can you even really call a robot coffee shop a coffee shop?

Artly has deployed its robot barista in a few places outside of Seattle, and it seems to be enjoying mixed results. There’s a location at Pier 39 in a touristy part of San Francisco, but a couple of other Bay Area-adjacent shopping mall locations listed on the company website appear as “permanently closed” on Google Maps; both are close to other, human-led options. And I should note that my experiences might not be typical of any Artly visit. While the drinks I had were better than average, they were also near company headquarters, or in the case of the CES visit, under the direct supervision of the company’s leadership. Not everyone has glowing things to say about the coffee quality. Even robots have a hard time meeting a high quality bar consistently, it seems.

I’m encouraged by the fact that Artly doesn’t really position Jarvis as a replacement for human barista jobs where they already exist. Right now, you can buy a coffee from one of their robots at Muji stores in the US and Canada. Notably, Muji didn’t employ any baristas before it got the robots. The company also lists Tesla’s Fremont factory as a partner location. As a job perk, especially somewhere less densely populated by fancy coffee shops than downtown Seattle, a robot barista doesn’t seem like a bad idea at all.

As an addition to an airport lounge, or maybe operating at a train station long after human workers have all gone home for the night, I think a robot barista makes total sense. Can you make a viable business out of those scenarios? I’m less sure. On both of my recent visits to Artly’s shops, I didn’t see anyone else come in and order a drink. Maybe both places are busier in the morning as people head to work, or during the summer when literal boatloads of tourists visit downtown. But especially around the Pike Place Market location, many of the coffee shops in the neighborhood look just as busy as ever.

If a coffee shop is just a place to walk in, place an order, and walk out with a coffee better than the one you can make at home, then Artly does the job. Depending on the hour and the day, sometimes that’s all I need a coffee shop to be. But more often than that, a coffee shop is a destination. It’s a place to go when I want to get out of the house. A physical manifestation of community. The coffee is usually excellent — shoutout once again to Seattle coffee culture — but even when it’s less than perfect, it offers humanity. And no robot can replicate that.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132042/whats-next-for-ev-batteries-in-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.)

The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content. Civitai’s situation is a little more complicated. Its marketplace includes actual images, videos, and models, but it also lets individuals buy and sell instruction files called LoRAs that can coach mainstream AI models like Stable Diffusion into generating content they were not trained to produce. Users can then combine these files with other tools to make deepfakes that are graphic or sexual. The researchers found that 86% of deepfake requests on Civitai were for LoRAs.

In these bounties, users requested “high quality” models to generate images of public figures like the influencer Charli D’Amelio or the singer Gracie Abrams, often linking to their social media profiles so their images could be grabbed from the web. Some requests specified a desire for models that generated the individual’s entire body, accurately captured their tattoos, or allowed hair color to be changed. Some requests targeted several women in specific niches, like artists who record ASMR videos. One request was for a deepfake of a woman said to be the user’s wife. Anyone on the site could offer up AI models they worked on for the task, and the best submissions received payment—anywhere from $0.50 to $5. And nearly 92% of the deepfake bounties were awarded.

Neither Civitai nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to requests for comment.

It’s possible that people buy these LoRAs to make deepfakes that aren’t sexually explicit (though they’d still violate Civitai’s terms of use, and they’d still be ethically fraught). But Civitai also offers educational resources on how to use external tools to further customize the outputs of image generators—for example, by changing someone’s pose. The site also hosts user-written articles with details on how to instruct models to generate pornography. The researchers found that the amount of porn on the platform has gone up, and that the majority of requests each week are now for NSFW content.

“Not only does Civitai provide the infrastructure that facilitates these issues; they also explicitly teach their users how to utilize them,” says Matthew DeVerna, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and one of the study’s leaders.

The company used to ban only sexually explicit deepfakes of real people, but in May 2025 it announced it would ban all deepfake content. Nonetheless, countless requests for deepfakes submitted before this ban now remain live on the site, and many of the winning submissions fulfilling those requests remain available for purchase, MIT Technology Review confirmed.

“I believe the approach that they’re trying to take is to sort of do as little as possible, such that they can foster as much—I guess they would call it—creativity on the platform,” DeVerna says.

Users buy LoRAs with the site’s online currency, called Buzz, which is purchased with real money. In May 2025, Civita’s credit card processor cut off the company because of its ongoing problem with nonconsensual content. To pay for explicit content, users must now use gift cards or cryptocurrency to buy Buzz; the company offers a different scrip for non-explicit content.

Civitai automatically tags bounties requesting deepfakes and lists a way for the person featured in the content to manually request its takedown. This system means that Civitai has a reasonably successful way of knowing which bounties are for deepfakes, but it’s still leaving moderation to the general public rather than carrying it out proactively.

A company’s legal liability for what its users do isn’t totally clear. Generally, tech companies have broad legal protections against such liability for their content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, but those protections aren’t limitless. For example, “you cannot knowingly facilitate illegal transactions on your website,” says Ryan Calo, a professor specializing in technology and AI at the University of Washington’s law school. (Calo wasn’t involved in this new study.)

Civitai joined OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies in 2024 in adopting design principles to guard against the creation and spread of AI-generated child sexual abuse material . This move followed a 2023 report from the Stanford Internet Observatory, which found that the vast majority of AI models named in child sexual abuse communities were Stable Diffusion–based models “predominantly obtained via Civitai.”

But adult deepfakes have not gotten the same level of attention from content platforms or the venture capital firms that fund them. “They are not afraid enough of it. They are overly tolerant of it,” Calo says. “Neither law enforcement nor civil courts adequately protect against it. It is night and day.”

Civitai received a $5 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in November 2023. In a video shared by a16z, Civitai cofounder and CEO Justin Maier described his goal of building the main place where people find and share AI models for their own individual purposes. “We’ve aimed to make this space that’s been very, I guess, niche and engineering-heavy more and more approachable to more and more people,” he said.

Civitai is not the only company with a deepfake problem in a16z’s investment portfolio; in February, MIT Technology Review first reported that another company, Botify AI, was hosting AI companions resembling real actors that stated their age as under 18, engaged in sexually charged conversations, offered “hot photos,” and in some instances described age-of-consent laws as “arbitrary” and “meant to be broken.”

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.
