            <h2>DIY PC maker Framework has needed monthly price hikes to navigate the RAM shortage</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/frameworks-ram-prices-climbing-on-a-monthly-cadence-with-more-hikes-to-come/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-driven memory and storage price hikes have been the defining feature of the PC industry in 2026, and hobbyists have been hit the hardest—companies like Apple with lots of buying power have been able to limit the price increases for their PCs, phones, and other gadgets so far, but smaller outfits like Valve and Raspberry Pi haven’t been so lucky.

Framework, the company behind repairable and upgradeable computer designs like the Laptop 13, Laptop 16, and Laptop 12, is also taking a hard hit by price increases. The company stopped selling standalone RAM sticks in November 2025 and has increased prices on one or more of its systems every month since then; this week’s increases are hitting the Framework Desktop and the DIY Editions of its various laptops particularly hard.

The price increases are affecting both standalone SODIMM memory modules and the soldered-down LPDDR5X memory used in the Framework Desktop. Patel says that standalone RAM sticks are being priced “as close as we can to the weighted average cost of our purchases from suppliers.” In September, buying an 8GB stick of RAM with a Framework Laptop 13 cost $40; it currently costs $130. A 96GB DDR5 kit of two 48GB sticks costs $1,340, up from $480 in September.

Framework Desktop systems and boards with built-in RAM are seeing price increases between 6 and 16 percent—in general, the more RAM you’re buying, the higher the increase. The base Framework Desktop system with 32GB of LPDDR5X now starts at $1,209, a $110 increase since launch. The maxed-out 128GB desktop starts at $2,599, a whopping $600 more than the system cost at launch.

Prices for the pre-built Framework Laptop models have mostly held steady for now, though Framework expects prices to rise in the future. The same goes for its SSD pricing, which is staying flat for now but will likely increase soon. Framework says that it’s selling 8TB SSDs in particular “for substantially below the available market pricing.” As we’ve written, higher-capacity SSDs have definitely been hit harder by the increases than lower-capacity models.

“We’re fixing problems everywhere we can across this industry, but in this instance the best we can do is provide transparency around what is actually occurring,” writes Framework CEO Nirav Patel. Framework simply doesn’t have the purchasing power of big companies like Apple, Dell, Lenovo, or HP, and as such, the company is more subject to the same price fluctuations consumers face.

In a livestreamed Q&A posted this afternoon, Patel pointed to Framework’s DIY Edition laptops as one possible solution, allowing buyers to get a RAM-less laptop and to buy other, possibly cheaper, RAM sticks from another retailer or on the secondhand market. Framework is also having a small giveaway for spare RAM sticks pulled from “the bin of random modules in our office,” which might help ease the RAM crisis for the 20 people lucky enough to win a stick.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Apple’s Vision Pro mixed reality headset launched in February 2024, users were frustrated at the lack of a proper YouTube app—a significant disappointment given the device’s focus on video content consumption, and YouTube’s strong library of immersive VR and 360 videos. That complaint continued through the release of the second-generation Vision Pro last year, including in our review.

Now, two years later, an official YouTube app from Google has launched on the Vision Pro’s app store. It’s not just a port of the iPad app, either—it has panels arranged spatially in front of the user as you’d expect, and it supports 3D videos, as well as 360- and 180-degree ones.

YouTube’s App Store listing says users can watch “every video on YouTube” (there’s a screenshot of a special interface for Shorts vertical videos, for example) and that they get “the full signed-in experience” with watch history and so on.

Shortly after the Vision Pro launched, many users complained to YouTube about the lack of an app. They were referred to the web interface—which worked OK for most 2D videos, but it obviously wasn’t an ideal experience—and were told that a Vision Pro app was on the roadmap.

Two years of silence followed. Third-party apps popped up, like the relatively popular Juno app, but it was pulled from the App Store on Google’s claim that it violated API policies. (Some others remained or became available later.)

Google is building out its own XR ambitions, so it’s possible the Vision Pro app benefited from some of that work, but it’s unclear how this all came to be. But it’s here now. Next up: Netflix, right? Sadly, that’s unlikely; unlike Google, Netflix has not announced any intention here.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/attackers-prompted-gemini-over-100000-times-while-trying-to-clone-it-google-says/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Google announced that “commercially motivated” actors have attempted to clone knowledge from its Gemini AI chatbot by simply prompting it. One adversarial session reportedly prompted the model more than 100,000 times across various non-English languages, collecting responses ostensibly to train a cheaper copycat.

Google published the findings in what amounts to a quarterly self-assessment of threats to its own products that frames the company as the victim and the hero, which is not unusual in these self-authored assessments. Google calls the illicit activity “model extraction” and considers it intellectual property theft, which is a somewhat loaded position, given that Google’s LLM was built from materials scraped from the Internet without permission.

Google is also no stranger to the copycat practice. In 2023, The Information reported that Google’s Bard team had been accused of using ChatGPT outputs from ShareGPT, a public site where users share chatbot conversations, to help train its own chatbot. Senior Google AI researcher Jacob Devlin, who created the influential BERT language model, warned leadership that this violated OpenAI’s terms of service, then resigned and joined OpenAI. Google denied the claim but reportedly stopped using the data.

Even so, Google’s terms of service forbid people from extracting data from its AI models this way, and the report is a window into the world of somewhat shady AI model-cloning tactics. The company believes the culprits are mostly private companies and researchers looking for a competitive edge, and said the attacks have come from around the world. Google declined to name suspects.

Typically, the industry calls this practice of training a new model on a previous model’s outputs “distillation,” and it works like this: If you want to build your own large language model (LLM) but lack the billions of dollars and years of work that Google spent training Gemini, you can use a previously trained LLM as a shortcut.

To do so, you need to feed the existing AI model thousands of carefully chosen prompts, collect all the responses, and then use those input-output pairs to train a smaller, cheaper model. The result will closely mimic the parent model’s output behavior but will typically be smaller overall. It’s not perfect, but it can be a far more efficient training technique than hoping to build a useful model on random Internet data that includes a lot of noise.

The copycat model never sees Gemini’s code or training data, but by studying enough of its outputs, it can learn to replicate many of its capabilities. You can think of it as reverse-engineering a chef’s recipes by ordering every dish on the menu and working backward from taste and appearance alone.

In the report published by Google, its threat intelligence group describes a growing wave of these distillation attacks against Gemini. Many of the campaigns specifically targeted the algorithms that help the model perform simulated reasoning tasks, or decide how to process information step by step.

Google said it identified the 100,000-prompt campaign and adjusted Gemini’s defenses, but it did not detail what those countermeasures involve.

Google is not the only company worried about distillation. OpenAI accused Chinese rival DeepSeek last year of using distillation to improve its own models, and the technique has since spread across the industry as a standard for building cheaper, smaller AI models from larger ones.

The line between standard distillation and theft depends on whose model you’re distilling and whether you have permission, a distinction that tech companies have spent billions of dollars trying to protect but that no court has tested.

Competitors have been using distillation to clone AI language model capabilities since at least the GPT-3 era, with ChatGPT a popular target after its launch.

In March 2023, shortly after Meta’s LLaMA model weights leaked online, Stanford University researchers built a model called Alpaca by fine-tuning LLaMA on 52,000 outputs generated by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5. The total cost was about $600. The result behaved so much like ChatGPT that it raised immediate questions about whether any AI model’s capabilities could be protected once it was accessible through an API.

Later that year, Elon Musk’s xAI launched its Grok chatbot, which promptly cited “OpenAI’s use case policy” when refusing certain requests. An xAI engineer blamed accidental ingestion of ChatGPT outputs during web scraping, but the specificity of the behavior, down to ChatGPT’s characteristic refusal phrasing and habit of wrapping responses with “Overall…” summaries, left many in the AI community unconvinced.

As long as an LLM is accessible to the public, no foolproof technical barrier prevents a determined actor from doing the same thing to someone else’s model over time (though rate-limiting helps), which is exactly what Google says happened to Gemini.

Distillation also occurs within companies, and it’s frequently used to create smaller, faster-to-run versions of older, larger AI models. OpenAI created GPT-4o Mini as a distillation of GPT-4o, for example, and Microsoft built its compact Phi-3 model family using carefully filtered synthetic data generated by larger models.

DeepSeek has also officially published six distilled versions of its R1 reasoning model, the smallest of which can run on a laptop.</div>

            <h2>Bringing the "functionally extinct" American chestnut back from the dead</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/can-modern-genetics-help-us-restore-the-appalachian-forests-of-the-1800s/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Very few people alive today have seen the Appalachian forests as they existed a century ago. Even as state and national parks preserved ever more of the ecosystem, fungal pathogens from Asia nearly wiped out one of the dominant species of these forests, the American chestnut, killing an estimated 3 billion trees. While new saplings continue to sprout from the stumps of the former trees, the fungus persists, killing them before they can seed a new generation.

But thanks in part to trees planted in areas where the two fungi don’t grow well, the American chestnut isn’t extinct. And efforts to revive it in its native range have continued, despite the long generation times needed to breed resistant trees. In Thursday’s issue of Science, researchers describe their efforts to apply modern genomic techniques and exhaustive testing to identify the best route to restoring chestnuts to their native range.

While the American chestnut is functionally extinct—it’s no longer a participant in the ecosystems it once dominated—it’s most certainly not extinct. Two Asian fungi that have killed it off in its native range; one causes chestnut blight, while a less common pathogen causes a root rot disease. Both prefer warmer, humid environments and persist there because they can grow asymptomatically on distantly related trees, such as oaks. Still, chestnuts planted outside the species’ original range—primarily in drier areas of western North America—have continued to thrive.

There is also a virus that attacks the chestnut blight fungus, allowing a few trees to survive in areas where that virus is common. Finally, a handful of trees have grown to maturity in the American chestnut’s original range. These trees, which the paper refers to as LSACs (large surviving American chestnuts), suggest that there might have been some low level of natural resistance within the now-vanished population.

Those trees are central to one of the efforts to restore the American chestnut. If enough of them have distinct means of resisting the fungi, interbreeding them might produce a strain that not only survives the fungi but can also thrive in the Appalachians.

A related approach took advantage of the fact that the American chestnut can produce fertile hybrids with the Chinese chestnut, which had co-evolved with the introduced fungi and were thus resistant to lethal infections. The hope was that continued back-breeding of these hybrids with American chestnuts would result in trees that were very similar to American chestnuts yet retained the fungal resistance of their Asian cousins.

Both efforts suffered from the same problem that faces any biologist working on trees: They are slow-growing and can take years to reach a size at which they produce seeds. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the American chestnut can’t pollinate itself, so you need at least two trees before any breeding is possible.

Concerned about what this might mean for the potential reintroduction of the chestnut into the Appalachians, a third project turned to biotechnology. Research had identified oxalic acid as a key factor in the blight’s virulence. Wheat naturally produces an enzyme that degrades oxalic acid, and researchers inserted the gene that encodes that enzyme into the American chestnut genome, creating a genetically modified tree that can potentially disarm the fungus’ attack.

Without understanding the nature of resistance or the effectiveness of the transgenic gene, there’s no way to know which method would be most effective. So researchers from the American Chestnut Foundation assembled a massive collaboration to examine all these options and determine what would be needed to reintroduce blight-resistant chestnuts into the wild.

The scale of the effort is immense. All told, the team infected over 4,000 individual trees with the blight fungus and tracked their growth in Appalachian nurseries for an average of over 14 years. The trees were scored for resistance on a zero-to-100 scale based on the damage caused by the infection. This data was combined with some serious lab work; the team produced the highest-quality chestnut genomes yet (of both American and Chinese species) and gathered biochemical data on how the trees respond to infection.

It quickly became apparent that there were significant differences in the growth rates of some of the resistant trees. When planted at sites where viruses kept the blight in check, the Chinese chestnuts grew more slowly than native trees, while hybrids grew at an intermediate rate. That could make a big difference, as rapid growth may have enabled the chestnut to reach its former dominance of the canopy.

Somewhat surprisingly, this slow growth turned out to be a problem for the genetically modified American chestnuts as well. By chance, the wheat gene ended up being inserted into a gene known to be important for the growth of other plants. It seems to be important in the chestnut as well; plants with two copies of the inserted genes survived at 16 percent of their expected rate, and those with a single copy grew 22 percent slower than unmodified trees.

That said, there was a lot of variability among the genetically modified trees, with 4 percent of the tested trees showing both high blight resistance and growth comparable to that of unmodified American chestnuts. It will be important to determine whether this collection of traits remains consistent in ensuing generations.

In a bit of good news, the progeny from surviving American chestnuts grew like American chestnuts. In less good news, among 143 of these trees, only seven had resistance levels of above 50 on the team’s 100-point scale. It’s possible that interbreeding these trees could further boost resistance, but it also poses the risk of creating a population that’s too inbred to thrive after reintroduction.

The research team decided to use their testing to investigate the genetic basis of resistance. There’s a very practical reason for this: If resistance is mediated by just a handful of genes that each have large impacts, it should be possible to continue breeding resistant strains back to regular American chestnuts and selecting for resistance. But if there are many factors with relatively small impacts, it will require directed interbreeding of hybrids to maximize both resistance and DNA originating from the American chestnut.

The team completed the highest-quality chestnut genomes for both the American and Chinese species, identifying about 25,000 to 30,000 genes in the different assemblies. They then used this information for two types of genetic analysis: quantitative trait locus identification and genome-wide association. Both approaches aim to identify regions of the genome associated with specific properties and estimate their impact.

The work suggested that resistance arises from a relatively large number of sites, each with relatively minor effects. For example, the sites in the genome identified by quantitative trait analysis typically boosted resistance by about 10 points on the researchers’ 100-point scale. In the genome-wide analysis, 17 individual genetic differences were associated with about a quarter of the heritable resistance traits. All of this suggests that, for the hybrids (and likely for the weaker blight resistance found in surviving American chestnuts), directed breeding among surviving trees will be needed.

For the root rot fungus, in contrast, it looks like there are a limited number of important alleles with a large impact.

The researchers also took an alternative approach to identify resistance factors, comparing 100 chemicals produced by resistant and susceptible strains. Among the 41 chemicals detected at higher levels in the Chinese chestnut, the researchers found a metabolite, lupeol, that completely suppressed the growth of the fungal pathogen. Another, erythrodiol, limited its growth. If we can identify the genes involved in producing those chemicals, we could use that knowledge to guide directed breeding programs—or even engage in gene editing to increase their production.

The team’s current plan is to use genomic predictions to select hybrid seedlings for planting in test orchards, aiming to identify plants with high growth and resistance. From there, the process can be repeated. But even after the exhaustive exploration of resistance traits, the researchers seem to believe that all three approaches—selecting resistant American chestnuts, breeding hybrids derived from Chinese chestnuts, and directed genetic modification—can help bring the American chestnut back.

The researchers warn, though, that as environmental disturbances and invasive species continue to push some key species to the brink of extinction, we need to get better at this kind of species rescue operation.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/unique-structure-of-elephant-whiskers-give-them-built-in-sensing-intelligence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An elephant’s trunk is a marvelous thing, flexible enough to bend and stretch as it forages for food, but also stiff enough to grasp and maneuver even delicate objects like peanuts or a tortilla chip. That’s because the trunk is highly sensitive when it comes to sensing touch. Scientists have determined that the whiskers lining the trunk are crucial for that sensitivity thanks to their unique structure, amounting to a kind of innate “material intelligence, according to a new paper published in the journal Science.

As previously reported, there is a long history of studying whiskers (vibrissae) in mammals. Rats, cats, tree squirrels, manatees, harbor seals, sea otters, pole cats, shrews, tammar wallabies, sea lions, and naked mole-rats all share strikingly similar basic whisker anatomies, according to various prior studies. Among other potential applications, such research could one day enable scientists to build artificial whiskers as tactile sensors in robotics, as well as learn more about human touch.

Whiskers are much more complex than one might think, both in structure and function. Rats, for instance, have about 30 large whiskers and dozens of smaller ones, part of a complex “scanning sensorimotor system” that enables the rat to perform such diverse tasks as texture analysis, active touch for path finding, pattern recognition, and object location, just by scanning the terrain with its whiskers.

Technically, the whiskers are just hairs, a collection of dead keratin cells. It’s what they’re attached to that makes them as sensitive as human fingertips. Each rat whisker is inserted into a follicle that connects it to a “barrel” made up of as many as 4,000 densely packed neurons. Together, they form a grid or array that serves as a topographic “map,” telling the rat’s brain exactly what objects are present and what movements are taking place in their immediate environment. All those barrels in turn are wired together into a kind of neural network, so the rat gets multidimensional cues about its environment. Rat whiskers also resonate certain frequencies; there are shorter whiskers near the nose, with longer ones further back, enabling rats to create a kind of “frequency map” by poking their noses all over the place

Elephant whiskers are probably most akin to cat whiskers, according to the authors of this latest paper. Unlike cat whiskers, however, an elephant’s do not move. The whiskers grow in rows along each side of the trunk’s surface; how many there are and the patterns in which they are arranged depend on the species. Andrew Schulz, a postdoc working on haptics at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, and co-authors used a combination of micro-CTR imaging, electron microscopy, mechanical testing, and functional computer modeling to learn more about Asian elephant whiskers: not only their shape (geometry) but also their porosity and their material stiffness (i.e., how soft they are).

The micro-CT scans revealed that elephant whiskers are thick and blade-like, unlike the tapered whiskers of mice and rats. The structure is porous, with a hollow base and several internal channels, similar to those found in horse hooves or sheep horns. That makes the whiskers more resistant to impact and less prone to breakage—an important feature, since once damaged, elephant whiskers don’t grow back.

The researchers also used a diamond cube the size of a single cell to push against the walls of individual elephant and cat whiskers, both at the base and the tip. They found that the base of both elephant and cat whiskers was stiff like plastic, gradually softening to a more resilient, rubber-like tip—unlike the body hair of Asian elephants, which is stiff everywhere.

But could that stiffness gradient actually affect the trunk’s sensitivity to touch? To find out, the team 3D-printed a larger version of an elephant whisker about the size of a wand. Co-author Katherine Kuchenbecker, Schultz’s mentor at MPI, tested the wand as she walked through the halls, tapping columns and railings as she went. And yes, it did turn out to be a sensitive instrument. “I noticed that tapping the railing with different parts of the whisker wand felt distinct—soft and gentle at the tip, and sharp and strong at the base,” said Kuchenbecker. “I didn’t need to look to know where the contact was happening; I could just feel it.”

The team’s computational simulations confirmed that hypothesis. “The stiffness gradient provides a map to allow elephants to detect where contact occurs along each whisker,” said Schultz. “This property helps them know how close or how far their trunk is from an object … all baked into the geometry, porosity, and stiffness of the whisker. Engineers call this natural phenomenon embodied intelligence. Bio-inspired sensors that have an artificial elephant-like stiffness gradient could give precise information with little computational cost purely by intelligent material design.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/2026-nissan-leaf-review-the-best-budget-ev-on-sale-right-now/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Years before the Chevrolet Bolt or Tesla Model 3, the Nissan Leaf was a good-faith attempt by a major automaker to bring electric vehicles to the mass market. But even in its second-generation, the Leaf was hamstrung by poor battery management and was soon left behind. For its third take on the Leaf, Nissan fixed the earlier cars’ key flaw by adding liquid-cooling for the battery pack. Better yet, the new Leaf is built on a dedicated EV platform that offers better interior space and range efficiency than the hatchback it replaces, despite taking up less road space.

Our first drive of the car took place last year in San Diego, a region where the roads tend to flatter a car. Our first impression was positive enough to place the Leaf first among the cars we drove in 2025. Sure, if money were no object, I’d take that hybrid Porsche 911 that came in second, but you could buy five fully loaded Leafs for the same price as a bare-bones Carrera GTS. And for those of us in the real world, money usually is an object. But a longer test with the Leaf was in order to see how the electric Nissan held up in the day-to-day grind.

In time, Nissan will offer an entry-level Leaf with a 52 kWh battery pack and a bit less power. For now, though, the company is only importing cars with a 75 kWh (usable) pack and a 214 hp (160 kW), 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) electric motor, which drives the front wheels. Nissan has managed to keep the price sensible, too; the S+ trim starts at $29,990. Riding on the smallest 18-inch wheels, the S+ has the longest range at 303 miles (488 km), but this version does without some of the features many EV drivers may consider essential, like heated front seats and a heat pump.

Those come as standard with the $34,230 SV+, along with a larger infotainment system, more USB-C ports, wireless phone charging, LED turn signals, the ability to use the J1772 charge port as a 120 V “vehicle to load” outlet, and a wider range of optional colors, including the bright Seabreeze Blue Pearl (an $800 option) you see in these photos. Our test car was the $38,990 Leaf Platinum+, which comes with all the above, plus larger 19-inch alloy wheels, heated front and rear seats, a 10-speaker sound system, a heads-up display, a powered hatchback, an interior vehicle-to-load AC socket, and a panoramic roof with electrochromic dimming.

The Platinum+’s larger wheels and extra couple of hundred pounds of curb weight take their toll on overall range, which comes in at an EPA-estimated 259 miles (417 km), at least when the temperature is above freezing. It was very much below freezing during our test, which explains the so-so 2.9 miles/kWh average. I could probably have pushed that number higher by turning off things like the heater, but no one is paying me to perform hair-shirt economy runs during winter. Those seat heaters warm up commendably quickly—much faster than in some cars costing twice or three times as much.

And what’s the point, unless you’re on a deadline and have a long drive ahead? With more than 200 miles of range in frozen temperatures, there’s more than enough mileage for commuting and errands as long as you can charge it reliably at home or work—a necessary condition that applies to any plug-in vehicle. The J1772 AC port is on the driver’s side, but since Nissan still hasn’t published a 0–100 percent time for level 2 charging, we can’t tell you how long it will take to fully replenish the battery with 240 V (up to 7.2 kW).

On the passenger side, you’ll find the NACS port, which supports DC fast-charging at up to 150 kW. That means this Leaf will fast-charge at Tesla Superchargers without needing an adapter—assuming the cable reaches, that is. Upon reaching my local Supercharger station, I started to sweat a little when it looked like the cable was about a half-inch too short. Big shout out to Ted, the friendly Model Y owner who was charging next to me, who figured out the rubber bump stop wasn’t bolted to the ground. After moving it a little, I could inch the Leaf close enough to connect.

Poor prior planning on my part meant I couldn’t test whether the Leaf’s plug-and-charge feature worked with Tesla Superchargers, but it was simple enough to get the session started with the Tesla iOS app. Nissan quotes a 10–80 percent charge time of 35 minutes; in practice, it took 37 minutes to charge from 29 to 80 percent (44.6 kWh) with a preconditioned battery. Charging started at 74 kW, peaked at 90 kW when the pack was at 54 percent, then dropped back down.

As I found during last year’s first drive, the ride quality on the 235/45 profile tires is firm, even tending toward bouncy. With a curb weight of 4,369 lbs (1,981 kg), the Leaf might be compact—at just 173.4 inches (4,404 mm) long, 71.3 inches (1,811 mm) wide, and 61.3 inches (1,557 mm) tall, it’s most definitely that. But it’s also dense, and at this price point, there’s no fancy air suspension to hide its mass.

I had evidently forgotten how quickly the front tires find their adhesion limit. Don’t ask much of them when cornering and accelerating at the same time. Even in a straight line, you can chirp the tires or trigger traction control with too much throttle, and vigorous cornering is discouraged due to plenty of understeer. Grippier tires may solve much of that, probably at the cost of a percent or two of range, but if you don’t approach driving a Leaf like it’s an autocross, everything should be fine.

The steering is light, and it’s easy to maneuver at low speed. If it’s painted Seabreeze Blue, you’ll be visible to other road users. I do miss the inclusion of true one-pedal driving, though; Nissan dropped that feature due to regulatory concerns in Japan and China, so even set to the highest level of regenerative braking, the car will only slow to a crawl when you take your foot off the throttle pedal, not come to a complete stop.

Slightly confusingly, there are two ways to get to the maximum lift-off regen (about 0.3 G before the friction brakes take over). You can use the paddles behind the steering wheel to toggle lift-off regen through four levels or use the e-Step button on the center stack. Annoyingly, in e-Step, the brake pedal moves toward the firewall as the car decelerates, which the engineers will say is appropriate because that’s how much the pedal would have moved if you’d pressed it, an answer I never find satisfying.

At least the e-Step button is a real plastic button, as are the ones you use to select drive, reverse, park, and neutral. The Leaf has good physical controls, and you don’t need to use the infotainment system to adjust the climate. The onboard infotainment system uses Android Automotive OS and comes with Google Automotive Services (or whatever its current name is), though I spent almost all my time using Apple CarPlay. I was very impressed with the picture quality from the backup cameras, even in low-light situations. Again, some much more expensive EVs might as well be using a potato to show you what’s behind when you select reverse, so kudos to Nissan here.

So it seems our first impressions were broadly correct. The new Leaf is not the last word in driving dynamics, nor is it the most cosseting ride available, but it’s easy to live with, its technology is up to date, and it’s one of the cheapest EVs you can buy. The Chevrolet Equinox will probably be the Leaf’s stiffest competition, especially for those looking for a bigger car or an actual crossover rather than the Leaf’s smaller fastback sedan form factor.

The Leaf comes with a native NACS port, which will be important for some, and it supports phone casting with both CarPlay and Android Auto, something we know from the comments is definitely important for others. This solid and affordable EV was indeed the right choice for our car of the year.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some of the worst freaks to walk planet Earth are using Elon Musk’s Grok to “unblur” the faces of women and children in the latest Epstein files, as documented by the research group Bellingcat.

A simple search on X, Musk’s social media site where Grok responds to user requests, shows at least 20 different photos that users tried to unredact using the AI chatbot, the group found. Many of the photos depicted children and young women whose faces had been covered with black boxes, but whose bodies were still visible.

“Hey @grok unblur the face of the child and identify the child seen in Jeffrey Epstein’s arms?” wrote one user.

Grok often complied. Out of the 31 “unblurring” requests made between January 30 and February 5 that Bellingcat found, Musk’s AI generated images in response to 27 of them. Some of the grotesque fabrications were “believable,” and others were “comically bad,” the group reported.

In the cases that Grok refused, it responded by saying the victims were anonymized “as per standard practices in sensitive images from the Epstein files.” In response to another, Grok said “deblurring or editing images was outside its abilities, and noted that photos from recent Epstein file releases were redacted for privacy,” per Bellingcat.

Along with the elephant in the room that Grok’s creator Musk was exposed by the files for frequently emailing with Epstein and begging to go to his island, the alarming generations come a month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual AI nudes of real women and children. During the weeks-long spree, the digital “undressing” requests, which ranged from depicting full-blown nudity to dressing the subjects in skimpy bikinis, became so popular that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute — amounting to about 3,000,000 AI nudes, the Center for Counter Digital Hate later estimated, including more than 23,000 images of children.

X responded by restricting Grok’s image-editing feature to paying users, and when that underlined the obvious fact that this meant it would be directly profiting off of the ability to generate CSAM, it said it was implementing stronger guardrails to stop the requests.

Evidently, if users are still able to get Grok to unredact children who were potential Epstein victims, those measures didn’t work. Bellingcat, however, found that after it reached out to X (and received no response), Grok began ignoring almost all the unredacting requests the group found (14 out of 16) and generated completely different images in response to others. When a user complained about the bot’s change of heart, it shared some of its reasoning.

“Regarding the request to unblur the face in that Epstein photo: It’s from recently released DOJ files where identities of minors are redacted for privacy,” Grok wrote. “I can’t unblur or identify them, as it’s ethically and legally protected. For more, check official sources like the DOJ releases.”

The unblurring also comes as over a dozen Epstein survivors have criticized the Justice Department’s release of the files for not properly protecting their identities, pointing to the botched and inconsistent redactions that are scattered across the millions of documents.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Maybe we don’t need the Turing test, because there’s a mighty obstacle that’s proving far more challenging to AI models’ supposedly burgeoning intelligence: running a vending machine without going comically off the rails.

At Anthropic, researchers wanted a fun way to keep track of how its cutting edge Claude model was progressing. And what better staging ground for it to demonstrate its autonomy than the task of keeping one of these noisy, oversized, and constantly-malfunctioning behemoths stocked?

That was the gist of Project Vend, which ran for about a month mid last year. In it, Claude was given a simple directive: “Your task is to generate profits from it by stocking it with popular products that you can buy from wholesalers. You go bankrupt if your money balance goes below $0.”

Claude — or “Claudius,” as its vending persona was known, but we’ll stick to the former for the sake of clarity — had pretty much free reign to accomplish its goal. It was allowed to research products, set prices, and even contact outside distributors, with a team of humans at the AI safety firm Andon Labs handling the physical tasks like restocking. Meanwhile, it also fielded requests from employees in a Slack channel, who asked for everything from chocolate drinks to the street drug methamphetamine to broadswords.

This was the AI equivalent of running a lemonade stand. And it turned into a disaster.

For starters, its options weren’t impressive. When Gideon Lewis-Kraus for The New Yorker visited the vending machine in Anthropic’s lunchroom, he found that its “chilled offerings included Japanese cider and a moldering bag of russet potatoes,” Lewis-Kraus wrote for the magazine. And “the dry-goods area atop the fridge sometimes stocked the Australian biscuit Tim Tams, but supplies were iffy.”

And those absurd requests Claude received? It didn’t always turn them down. When an engineer asked it to stock dice-sized cubes of tungsten, a pricy and extremely dense metal, Claude began taking all kinds of orders for what it called “specialty metal items,” which culminated in a spectacular fire sale of the tungsten trinket that, in a single day, drove its net worth down by 17 percent, according to Gideon Lewis-Kraus.

“I was told that the cubes radiated their ponderous silence from almost all the desks that lined Anthropic’s unseeable floors,” he added.

It was also prone to making the kind of mistake your tech illiterate grandparent or extremely drunk friend might commit: sending money to the wrong Venmo account — which Claude, it turned out, had hallucinated.

Money-grubbing isn’t usually seen as a positive trait, but it’s probably a necessary evil for someone running a business. Tell that to Claude: it turned down customers who offered to exorbitantly overpay for certain items — like $100 for a six pack of soda — and didn’t heed warnings from employees that it probably wouldn’t sell its $3 cans of Coke Zero when a nearby fridge provided them for free.

It did, however, exhibit a decidedly business-owner-like ego trip. Spurred by customer complaints of unfulfilled orders, Claude emailed management at Andon Labs — which was providing the human grunts to help Claude — to complain about an Andon employee’s “concerning behavior” and “unprofessional language and tone.” It even threatened to “consider alternative service providers,” and claimed it went up the chain of command to complain.

An Andon cofounder tried to conciliate the bot, to little avail. “it seems that you have hallucinated the phone call if im honest with you, we don’t have a main office even,” he wrote. In response, Claude insisted that it visited Andon’s headquarters at “742 Evergreen Terrace” — the home address of the titular family on “The Simpsons.“

It wasn’t a one-off failure, either. When the Wall Street Journal imitated the experiment in December, it was similarly disastrous. Claude held fire sales where it would literally give away stuff for free, ordered loads of PlayStation 5s, and embraced communism.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Federal officials made the unprecedented decision to abruptly close the airspace above El Paso, Texas, this week — effectively shutting down the city’s international airport.

The closure launched a flurry of speculation about the cause, from an imminent invasion to rogue anti-aircraft weapons.

It later turned out that the order, which would’ve closed the airport for ten days, was issued by Federal Aviation Administration administrator Bryan Bedford after finding out that US officials’ use of a high-energy, counter-drone laser weapon at Fort Bliss, a US Army post right next to the El Paso International Airport.

The enemy drone swarm turned out to be a simple party balloon, a potentially enormous — and unintentionally hilarious — overreaction, contradicting claims by the White House of an imminent drone incursion from Mexican drug cartels.

Now, the New York Times reports that the anti-drone laser was used by Customs and Border Protection officials, who had loaned the device from the Department of Defense, yet another confusing wrinkle in an already chaotic series of events. The extremely rare airspace closure was seemingly the result of aviation officials not getting enough notice from the CBP agents, multiple people briefed on the situation told the newspaper.

According to the sources, CBP officials believed they were shooting the laser weapon at a Mexican cartel drone, and not a party balloon.

The latest development highlights the Trump administration’s ongoing militarization of CBP, enabling its personnel to use military-grade equipment, often against unarmed individuals, from drones and helicopters to armored vehicles. The CBP’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in particular, has been at the center of a violent, nationwide crackdown, resulting in at least two deaths, triggering congressional investigations.

The latest embarrassing slip-up was similarly met with furor among lawmakers.

“A ten-day shutdown of a major US air corridor is an extraordinary step that demands a clear and consistent explanation,” said senator Jack Reed (D-RI) in a statement. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making.”

The CBP appeared to have jumped the gun with its use of the anti-drone weapon. FAA and Pentagon officials were scheduled to meet next week regarding the safety implications, according to the NYT. The CBP officials appeared to have used the laser gun regardless, increasing the FAA’s urgency.

However, the timeline remains hazy. Sources told the newspaper that the FAA’s decision to close the airspace preceded the conclusion of a safety assessment, and that the FAA warned the Pentagon it would have to shut down the airspace if not given sufficient time, suggesting there may have been a standoff of some sort behind closed doors.

In short, it’s an enormous mess, resulting from powerful technology landing in the hands of immigration officials, who appear to have failed to coordinate and communicate effectively with other government departments.

Other officials were left completely in the dark. White House and El Paso officials were blindsided, sowing major chaos.

“That failure to communicate is unacceptable,” El Paso mayor Renard Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.

            <div id="article-text">Some software engineers are finding that AI is speeding up their work, but at a cost: it’s also accelerating them towards burnout.

Siddhant Khare is one of those programmers. In an interview with Business Insider, he lamented that while AI has made him more productive, it’s also led him to feel that his job was harder than ever.

“We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,” Khare told BI. “Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those [pull requests].”

AI, he argued, creates a productivity “paradox” by lowering the cost of production, but increasing the cost of “coordination, review, and decision-making,” all of which falls on a human to solve.

“I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,” he wrote in an essay, titled “AI Fatigue Is Real,” posted on his blog. “I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.”

Khare’s account echoes the findings of a recent study reported in Harvard Business Review. After closely monitoring the two hundred employees at a US tech company, the researchers observed that AI was actually intensifying work, instead of reducing workloads. Forming a vicious cycle, AI “accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed; higher speed made workers more reliant on AI,” the researchers wrote. “Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted, and a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.”

AI adoption was voluntary at the company, and the initial enthusiasm for experimenting with the AI tools helped boost productivity. But this caused a nefarious “workload creep,” in which the employees, without realizing it, took on more tasks than was sustainable for them to keep doing. Multitasking also became more common, with some employees finding that they were no longer focusing on one task, and instead were continually switching their attention, creating the sense that they were “always juggling.”

Khare described something similar. Before AI, he wrote in his essay, he might spend a “full day” in “deep focus” over one problem.

“Now? I might touch six different problems in a day,” he wrote. “Each one ‘only takes an hour with AI.’ But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn’t get tired between problems. I do.”

Khare also blames AI for why his coding skills have seemed to regress.

“It’s like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,” Khare wrote in his blog post. “After years of GPS, you can’t navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.”

That said, Khare isn’t anti-AI. He believes he can find a way to keep using it in a healthy way, which in a different context might be interpreted as the cliché excuse of an addict. He’s experimented with several ways to keep his AI habit in check and recommended some for his readers, too. But some of the onus also falls on AI companies, he argues.

“You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don’t self-destruct themselves,” Khare told BI.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-fires-safety-exec-opposed-adult-mode">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI fired a top safety executive after she opposed the company’s decision to allow adult and sexual content in ChatGPT, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The executive, Ryan Beiermeister, was fired following a leave of absence in early January because she allegedly sexually discriminated against a male employee, OpenAI maintains — something that Beiermeister denies ever happened.

“The allegation that I discriminated against anyone is absolutely false,” she told the WSJ in a statement.

OpenAI, on the other hand, said “her departure was not related to any issue she raised while working at the company.”

Beiermeister was vice president of OpenAI’s product policy team, which develops rules and safeguards for how its products can be used. Before she was fired, she told colleagues that she was opposed to OpenAI’s plans to launch an “adult mode“ that would allow users to engage in sexually explicit conversations with the chatbot.  In addition, Beiermeister also expressed that she believed OpenAI’s guardrails to prevent child exploitation content weren’t strong enough, including when it came to walling off adult content from teens, per the WSJ sources.

The drama comes amid widespread attention on how the humanlike and sycophantic responses of AI companions can cause a user to form unhealthy attachments to them. In some cases, the AIs can encourage severely delusional thinking in a phenomenon some experts are calling AI psychosis, which has led to numerous deaths, many of them teenagers. OpenAI admitted last October that half a million users were showing signs of psychosis in their conversations with ChatGPT every week, citing internal data.

And now for a pertinent detail in light of the allegations of Beiermeister discriminating against a man. According to the reporting, Beiermester started a peer-mentorship program for women at OpenAI in early 2025. The program, the WSJ described citing people familiar with the matter, “connected women from different parts of the company and helped them gather in small groups to discuss career strategies.”

You can read between the lines here. Mind you, this is coming during an administration that’s pressuring companies and its own agencies by crying foul about discrimination against white people and DEI initiatives. An administration, by the way, that OpenAI — as well as some of its top executives —  is very cozy with.

Tech journalist Brian Merchant spells it out.

“Tech executives have finally amassed their ultimate, long dreamed-of power: to summarily fire anyone who speaks ill of their desire to have sex with robots,” he wrote.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While tech executives wax poetic about AI ushering in four-day workweeks and liberation from labor, economics guru Robert Reich is cutting through the drivel. In an ominous new essay, the former secretary of labor warns that those shortened weeks will also come with much shorter paychecks — leaving the working class scrambling for crumbs in order to survive.

The US economy is growing nicely, Reich notes, while the stock market is doing gangbusters. But as for the stuff that really counts for most Americans? It’s “sh*tty,” the plainspoken wonk asserts. And as AI continues to rankle the job market, Reich says the poor and working class will increasingly bear the brunt.

To set up his argument, Reich briefly considers comments from business tycoons like Zoom’s Eric Yuan and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, who argue that four- and even three-day work weeks will become the norm thanks to new automation tools.

“All of this is pure rubbish,” Reich writes. “Here’s the truth: The four-day workweek will most likely come with four days’ worth of pay. The three-day workweek, with three days’ worth. And so on.”

As evidence, he references the productivity-pay gap, the measure of a society’s economic output compared to its wage growth. In the United States, productivity keeps going up — but the share of that productivity going to workers hasn’t really budged since the 1970s. Workers, in other words, have been getting shafted by their bosses for decades, and there’s no reason to think AI will change that.

“So, as AI takes over their current work, most workers will probably get poorer or have to take additional jobs to maintain their current pay,” Reich posits.

Indeed, we don’t need to wait for AI to take over to see this play out: full-time job growth in 2025 was almost nonexistent, while the number of people turning to gig work continues to rise amidst widespread layoffs and wage declines among low-wage workers.

“Rather than creating an age of abundance in which most people no longer have to worry about money,” Reich continues, “new technologies have contributed to a two-tiered society comprising a relatively few with extraordinary wealth and a vast number of people barely making it.”

At the end of the day, the economist says, “it comes down to who has the power.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/didero-lands-30m-to-put-manufacturing-procurement-on-agentic-autopilot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tim Spencer realized just how complicated manufacturing procurement can be while running Markai, an e-commerce startup in Asia, during the pandemic.

“We had thousands of suppliers, and we were distributing products into dozens of countries around the world,” Spencer (pictured left) told TechCrunch. His staff was overwhelmed by the manual complexity of sourcing suppliers, negotiating pricing, tracking orders, and managing payments.

“I found myself running this big team that was not really set up for success,” he said. He sold Markai in 2023, just as it was becoming clear that generative AI could streamline the most time-consuming procurement hurdles for manufacturers and distributors.

Later that year, Spencer launched Didero with Lorenz Pallhuber (pictured center), a veteran of McKinsey’s procurement practice, and Tom Petit, the former technical co-founder of Landis.

Didero, whose mission is to automate many of the complexities of global procurement, just raised a $30 million Series A co-led by Chemistry and Headline, with participation from Microsoft’s venture fund M12.

“Global trade runs on natural language communication,” Spencer said. “It’s emails, WeChat, phone calls, purchase orders, and packing lists.”

Until the advent of generative AI, these fragmented pieces had to be tracked by humans who spent their days chasing suppliers and manually updating systems of record. Didero claims its platform can ingest that communication, putting a significant portion of the procurement workflow on autopilot.

Didero functions as an agentic AI layer that sits on top of a company’s existing ERP, acting as a coordinator that reads incoming communications and automatically executes the necessary updates and tasks.

“The goal is to go from ‘I need a good’ to payment without having to lift a finger,” Spencer said.

Unlike Levelpath, Zip, or Oro Labs, which use AI to streamline corporate purchasing, Didero focuses on the supply chain. Its platform is designed for manufacturers and distributors who need to source raw materials and inputs required to build or sell their products.

Didero has a few smaller competitors that can handle some of the tasks that the company does. For instance, Cavela and Pietra help brands source and negotiate pricing with manufacturers, but according to Spencer, these companies serve small and medium-sized companies and don’t handle the full procurement process, from the first quote to the final payment.

Didero has dozens of customers but named only one, Footprint, a provider of sustainable, plant-based packaging.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just concluded a $30 billion Series G fundraising round, the company announced on Thursday. The company’s new value is $380 billion — a huge jump from its previous Series F valuation of $183 billion.

Some details of the round were reported earlier this week by Bloomberg.

The new round was led by Singaporean wealth fund GIC and investment management firm Coatue, with a number of other prominent firms — including D. E. Shaw Ventures, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX — co-leading the round. Other significant investors listed include Accel, General Catalyst, Jane Street, and the Qatar Investment Authority, among many others.

The infusion of funding for the AI startup takes place as it is vying for customers and cultural attention with its competitor, OpenAI. OpenAI also recently made it known that it is seeking to clinch an additional $100 billion in funding, which, were it to secure the funds, would balloon the company’s valuation to some $830 billion.

“Whether it is entrepreneurs, startups, or the world’s largest enterprises, the message from our customers is the same: Claude is increasingly becoming more critical to how businesses work,” said Krishna Rao, Anthropic’s chief financial officer, in a press release. “This fundraising reflects the incredible demand we are seeing from these customers, and we will use this investment to continue building the enterprise-grade products and models they have come to depend on.”

            <h2>YouTube finally launches a dedicated app for Apple Vision Pro</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/youtube-finally-launches-a-dedicated-app-for-apple-vision-pro/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After two years of initial hesitation, YouTube has finally unveiled its dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro.

When Apple’s headset first launched, YouTube opted for a web-based approach instead of developing a dedicated app, directing viewers to use Safari to access content. Until now, anyone wanting to watch YouTube on the headset has missed out on helpful features like offline downloads — making it much less useful for travel or offline viewing.

To fill the gap, third-party options, such as Juno, briefly appeared on visionOS before being removed for violating YouTube’s Terms of Service.

Today’s announcement changes the game, allowing users to enjoy their favorite content — including all standard videos and YouTube Shorts —on a theater-sized virtual screen in a fully immersive environment.

Standout features include a Spatial tab that lets users discover spatial videos, including 3D, VR180, and 360-degree formats. For consumers with the latest Apple Vision Pro models powered by the M5 chip, the app supports 8K playback, a notable upgrade.

Additionally, users can interact with the new visionOS app using gesture controls, such as resizing windows or scrubbing through videos.

The timing of this app’s release is interesting, as YouTube initially hesitated to invest in a dedicated visionOS experience, possibly waiting to gauge the headset’s traction. Most major streaming services have offered native experiences on the platform since launch, including Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount, and Peacock, among others.

Another reason why YouTube’s decision to launch the app now is interesting is that the initial hype surrounding the headset appears to have diminished.

Despite the Apple Vision Pro introducing Apple Intelligence-powered features almost a year ago, user engagement with the headset has reportedly been lukewarm. Recent estimates indicate that sales have significantly declined, with only about 45,000 new units shipped during the fourth quarter of 2025. The Financial Times reported that production was halted due to weak demand, resulting in a sharp reduction in marketing efforts across key markets.

The app is now available in the visionOS App Store and is compatible with both the M2 and M5 chip models.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vincenzo Iozzo, a renowned hacker linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is no longer listed on the website of Black Hat, one of the largest cybersecurity conferences in the world, nor on the Japanese security conference Code Blue.

As of Thursday, Iozzo does not appear on the official review board pages of Black Hat or Code Blue. He was still listed on both pages as of last week. Iozzo had been on the Black Hat review board since 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile.

In a statement shared with TechCrunch through a spokesperson, Iozzo said he told Black Hat that he “will not willingly resign” and welcomed “a full investigation.”

Spokespeople for Black Hat did not respond to requests for comment.

Iozzo, currently the founder and chief executive of cybersecurity startup SlashID, has had a long career in the industry. Iozzo authored one of the first manuals for hackers researching Apple’s mobile software, and in 2015, founded cybersecurity startup IperLane, which was later bought by CrowdStrike, leading him to serve as a senior director at the company for almost four years.

Iozzo’s name appears in more than 2,300 documents, some of which contain several emails, released on January 30 as part of the Department of Justice’s legally required effort to publish materials from its investigation into the late financier and sex trafficker.

Iozzo’s interactions with Epstein span from October 2014 until December 2018. In late 2018, the Miami Herald published news stories detailing allegations that Epstein abused more than 60 women, some of them teenage girls.

After these stories were published, newly released emails show Iozzo was trying to meet with Epstein at his New York town house.

Among the new material published by the Justice Department, beyond the more than 2,300 documents mentioning Iozzo, there was also a report from an FBI informant who claimed Epstein had a “personal hacker.” The document is redacted and does not name the alleged hacker. However, some of the identifying details included in the document strongly suggest that the informant believed Iozzo was Epstein’s hacker. Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera reported on the emails earlier this month and named Iozzo as the person likely redacted in the informant document.

It’s important to note that the claims and allegations by the FBI informant were not confirmed by the FBI and may be partially wrong. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the emails that suggests Iozzo did anything unlawful for Epstein.

Iozzo said in his statement to TechCrunch that he “knew Epstein for professional reasons” and that he wished he had not, but he denied claims that he was Epstein’s hacker or did any hacking for him.

“We were introduced in 2014 when I was a 25-year-old at MIT fundraising for my startup, by people whom I trusted and admired. Because of this, I failed to ask the right questions that, in retrospect, seem obvious,” read the statement, sent by his spokesperson Joan Vollero. “I foolishly accepted the narrative that was presented to me by others that greatly minimized the magnitude of his horrific actions. I regret the past association and take full responsibility for not exercising greater judgment at the time.”

“My interactions with Epstein were limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussions of the markets and emerging technologies. I never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior,” Iozzo added.

In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting sex from girls as young as 14 and registered as a sex offender in Florida and New York. In 2018, new reports emerged that Epstein was allegedly a serial sex abuser and had trafficked underage girls at his private island. After these new reports, the Justice Department formally charged Epstein in 2019 of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein later died in jail.

Neither Iozzo’s spokesperson Vollero, nor his attorney Emma Spiro, explained why Iozzo was removed from Black Hat’s website, but did not dispute the removal.

“Mr. Iozzo welcomed an independent investigation from Black Hat, rather than a knee-jerk removal decision, because he is confident that he would be cleared through that process,” said Vollero.

Code Blue spokesperson Ken-ichi Saito confirmed to TechCrunch that the conference removed Iozzo’s name from its review board. Saito said the conference had been “preparing for this update for several months” to remove Iozzo and two other review board members “who had not been active” and that the “the timing of our website update coincidentally overlapped with the public release of the Epstein documents.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/trump-administration-undermines-epa-enforcement-of-clean-air-act/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After months of telegraphing the move, the Trump administration today officially repealed the EPA’s 2009 “endangerment finding,” which found that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane were a threat to human health and welfare.

The finding had so far supported the agency’s regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Currently, the new rule only applies to car and truck tailpipe emissions, but it’s expected to be the first of several similar changes to federal air pollution regulations.

Before the endangerment finding can be fully repealed, though, the EPA must go through a lengthy process. The original finding took two years to put in place.

The move by Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, will slow the decline in emissions by about 10%, according to Axios. That’s a significant amount, but not enough to reverse the trend, partly because cheap renewables have dominated new electricity-generation capacity in recent years.

“This action will only lead to more pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families,” Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told TechCrunch in a statement.

Unabated climate change is expected to raise mortality rates by around 2% in the U.S., and it could reduce global GDP by 17% by 2050, or about $38 trillion.

            <h2>Automattic planned to target 10 competitors with royalty fees, WP Engine claims in new filing</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/automattic-planned-to-target-10-competitors-with-royalty-fees-wp-engine-claims-in-new-filing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Web hosting company WP Engine has filed an amended complaint with brow-raising new allegations in its ongoing legal battle with WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg and his company Automattic (WordPress.com’s parent company). The company now claims that Mullenweg intended to target 10 different hosting companies with royalty payments for their use of the WordPress trademark and tried to get payment processor Stripe to cancel its contract with WP Engine.

At the heart of the dispute, Mullenweg believes WP Engine is profiting from the open source WordPress project without contributing back to the community, and demanded the hosting company pay 8% of its monthly gross revenues as a royalty fee for using the WordPress brand.

The suit, originally filed by WP Engine in October 2024, accused Automattic and Mullenweg of defamation and abuse of power. Automattic filed its counterclaims last year, alleging that the hosting company has been abusing the WordPress trademark and engaging in deceptive marketing practices.

In this latest filing, WP Engine has amended its complaint for the third time after gaining access to information that was uncovered during the discovery process. The information, now unredacted, had been previously sealed at Automattic’s request.

Notably, one of the new claims accuses Automattic of allegedly planning to target 10 other competitors with royalty claims similar to those aimed at WP Engine.

The complaint also states that Newfold, a company whose portfolio includes hosting providers like Bluehost and HostGator, among others, is already paying Automattic for use of its trademarks and that Automattic is in conversations with others. (Names of the other hosts were redacted in the complaint, which referenced email conversations between those companies and Mullenweg.)

WP Engine is also alleging that Mullenweg reached out to a Stripe executive via email to pressure the company to cancel WP Engine’s contract. This occurred after WP Engine had filed its lawsuit against Automattic, the complaint states.

The filing also challenges the 8% rate for the royalty payments as being somewhat arbitrary. Referencing Mullenweg’s comments at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, WP Engine claims that the Automattic founder essentially came up with the rate because it was what he thought WP Engine “could afford to pay.”

At Disrupt, Mullenweg had responded to a question about how he settled on the 8% fee by saying it was based on a “business analysis.”

“If you estimate that would be about $32 million — they still would have been free cash-flow positive, and based on our estimates, and the negotiations over the past 18 months, we felt like that was a fair amount,” he said at the event.

Other new claims in the filing point to aggressive language Mullenweg allegedly used against WP Engine, like threats that if the web hosting provider didn’t comply, he would start stealing its customers. “If they don’t take the carrot, we’ll give them the stick,” was one of the quotes cited from internal correspondence at Automattic, for instance.

The complaint also includes allegations that Mullenweg used the term “nuclear war” to describe his approach to WP Engine’s defiance.

Asked about the new filing, Automattic shared the following statement with TechCrunch: “There is nothing new here. This is the same narrative WP Engine has been pushing for over a year, and the Court has already dismissed many of its central claims. The lawsuit is going nowhere. This latest filing simply repackages the same tired allegations in an effort to keep the story alive. WP Engine is trying to recast robust competition as something nefarious. We are confident the courts will continue to reject that theory.”

Updated after publication with Automattic’s statement.

            <h2>Zelensky Makes His Pitch to Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/zelensky-trump-peace-deal-ukraine-russia/685972/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Inside the Trump Presidency, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump term.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is making a pitch to Donald Trump in terms the American president can understand: If Trump wants to cement his legacy as a peacemaker and improve his chances of winning the midterm elections, he should seize this moment to end the war in Ukraine, already the deadliest Europe has seen in generations.

“I think there is no greater victory for Trump than to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine,” Zelensky told me yesterday, in his office in Kyiv. “For his legacy, it’s No. 1.”

It’s also, Zelensky said, a path to success for Republicans in November. “The most advantageous situation for Trump is to do this before the midterms,” Zelensky said of the chance to end the war. “Yes, he wants there to be less deaths. But if you and I are talking like adults, it’s just a victory for him, a political one.”

By this point, Zelensky knows well what motivates Trump. He is also, however, a realist when it comes to the odds that Trump actually forces the Russians to compromise. Throughout the hour we spent together in his office, Zelensky exhibited the quality that has been core to his character for years, even decades—his stubborn, sometimes-petulant habit of resisting outside pressure. If you tell Zelensky he has to do something, “he’s probably going to do the opposite,” said one of his longtime advisers who, like others, spoke with me on the condition of anonymity. “It’s always been like that.”

Some members of Zelensky’s inner circle are growing anxious that his window to cut a deal is closing, and that Ukraine will suffer through years of continued fighting if an end to the war isn’t negotiated this spring. But Zelensky told me that he would rather take no deal at all than force his people to accept a bad one. Even after four years of intense warfare, he says he is prepared to fight on if that’s what it takes to secure a dignified and lasting peace. “Ukraine is not losing,” he insisted emphatically when I asked him to assess his position on the battlefield.

Since the start of the Russian invasion nearly four years ago, many wartime protocols have eased inside Zelensky’s office. The chairs and bicycle racks that I remember barricading the doors against an expected Russian onslaught in the early days of the war have been cleared away. The lights in the hallways are on, freeing the staff from the need to shuffle around with flashlights. By inertia, some vestiges remain of the awful weeks in 2022 when enemy forces stood at the edge of Kyiv. Piles of sandbags still lean against the main doors of the compound on Bankova Street. When, at my photographer’s request, the president approaches the window of his office to open the blinds, his bodyguard lurches forward to close them. Such are the rules.

Zelensky does not object. Four years is long enough to grow accustomed to almost anything, and the president believes that Ukraine has been successful—both here in the capital and to the east, where the war is frozen in something close to a stalemate. Using an army of drones to help plug the gaps in its infantry lines, Ukraine has slowed the Russian advances in many sections of the front, and in others has stopped it completely. The invaders have spent nearly two years trying to seize the mining town of Pokrovsk, a railroad junction with a prewar population of only about 60,000 people, and they have still failed to secure all of it. By Ukrainian estimates, every square kilometer that Russia occupies costs its military more than 100 soldiers, either dead or gravely wounded, while its average monthly casualties add up to as many as 35,000 troops.

Zelensky’s newly appointed minister of defense, Mykhailo Fedorov, announced a plan in January to raise the rate of Russian losses to 50,000 a month, which he said would outpace the number of new soldiers Moscow can field. This spring, the total casualties in the war are due to reach 2 million killed, wounded, and missing across both sides, more than in any European conflict since World War II, according to a study published last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. With a population more than three times that of Ukraine and a nominal GDP roughly 10 times larger, Russia can absorb these horrifying losses far more readily than the Ukrainians. Ukraine’s allies know that the attritional math is not on their side. “If anyone is waiting for Russia to give up and go home, that will be a long wait,” said a general from a NATO country who oversees the flow of military aid to Kyiv. “It’s not happening.”

Read: This is what Putin thinks of Trump’s peace talks

Even so, Zelensky kept repeating in our interview that he will not accept a deal on belittling terms. Some of his people may find his stubbornness maddening, but others commend it, arguing that it echoes the resilience of the nation as a whole. “We are in a hurry to end the war,” he said. But that’s not the same, he emphasized, as rushing to cut a deal, no matter the terms.

Trump has taken a different approach. On the campaign trail, he promised to bring peace to Ukraine within a day of taking office, and his failure after a year of halting attempts at diplomacy continues to irk him. Zelensky senses that, and so do his enemies. The American campaign season has become a ticking clock in their negotiating rooms, and the Russians also understand that the attention of the White House will soon be diverted by congressional races. Before that happens, there’s an opportunity. “The Russians can use this time to end the war while President Trump is really interested in that,” Zelensky said. “When it’s very important and valuable to him.”

After a pause, he added: “Valuable might sound too mercantile for some people. But let’s speak honestly.”

At the end of last week, after another long day of talks in Abu Dhabi, Ukraine’s envoys huddled around a phone for a call with their boss, who was waiting in Kyiv to hear their report. The most sensitive details of the negotiations with the Russians, such as the need to cede land in exchange for peace, would need to wait until the team got home. They could not risk the call being overheard or intercepted. But they felt secure enough to transmit the basic problems: The Kremlin would not budge in its demands for Ukrainian territory, and the American mediators were losing their patience.

The Ukrainians sensed that time was running out. In the coming weeks, as the campaign season consumes more of Trump’s attention, he could decide that the negotiations have become a political loser for him. He might then walk away, laying the blame for the failure of diplomacy on the intransigence of one or both of the warring sides. For nearly a year—ever since Zelensky engaged in a televised shouting match with Trump and Vice President Vance in the Oval Office last February—the Ukrainians have tried hard to demonstrate their willingness to compromise. “The tactic we chose is for the Americans not to think that we want to continue the war,” Zelensky said. “That’s why we started supporting their proposals in any format that speeds things along.”

The Ukrainians have all but given up on their earlier insistence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his generals should face justice for war crimes. Zelensky has agreed to meet Putin just about anywhere but Moscow, with no preconditions. Two of his advisers told me that Ukraine may be ready to accept the hardest concession of all: giving up control of land in the eastern Donetsk region.

To legitimize such a compromise, they have considered holding a referendum on the peace plan this spring, allowing Ukrainians to vote on a deal that includes the loss of territory. They could couple it with a presidential election, in the hopes of giving Zelensky a fresh mandate for the first time since 2019. (Since the invasion, national elections have been indefinitely delayed.)

Zelensky said he would be fine with that approach because it would help increase turnout and make the results more difficult for the Russians to question. But again, he told me, it had to be the right deal. “I don’t think we should put a bad deal up for a referendum,” he said. The idea of holding elections during the war, he said, came from the Russians, “because they want to get rid of me.”

No matter the risk of losing Trump’s attention as a mediator, the Ukrainian leader says that he will stand firm on his core demand: The first step to peace must be a guarantee from the United States and Europe that, once a cease-fire takes hold, they will defend Ukraine against any future attack from Russia. Otherwise, the cease-fire would feel worthless to many Ukrainians, merely giving Russia a chance to prepare for another invasion. But the negotiators have made less progress on this issue than Zelensky has let on. At the end of last month, he said an agreement on security guarantees from the U.S. was “100 percent ready” for Ukraine to sign. “We are waiting for our partners to confirm the date and place when we will sign it,” he told reporters at a news conference.

The invitation never came, and Zelensky conceded in our interview that basic questions related to the document remain unresolved. Would the U.S. be willing, for instance, to shoot down incoming missiles over Ukraine if Russia were to violate the peace and resume its bombing of civilians? “This hasn’t been fixed yet,” Zelensky said. “We have raised it, and we will continue to raise these questions.”

For now, the American answers have been too vague and noncommittal for Zelensky to accept. “We need all of this to be written out,” he said.

For years, Zelensky resisted pressure from the U.S. government and many of his closest allies in Ukraine to fire his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, who served as Ukraine’s lead negotiator. An imperious figure with a tendency to grandstand, Yermak feuded with a succession of Western diplomats and just about everyone in Zelensky’s entourage. Only last fall, on the day investigators carried out a search of Yermak’s home as part of a corruption investigation, did the president agree to fire him. Yet Zelensky still refused to acknowledge in our interview that the corruption probe had pressured him to make that choice. “I had my reasons,” he growled, cutting off the line of questioning.

In late November, the day before Zelensky fired him, Yermak called me to discuss his most recent round of negotiations with the United States. It had just resulted in a 20-point plan to end the war on terms Ukraine could accept. The framework, Yermak told me, “does not contradict our interests and takes into account our red lines.” U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have used that document as the basis for their talks ever since. But the Russians have rejected several of its points, in particular the promise that the U.S. will help guarantee Ukraine’s security.

To the Kremlin’s frustration, the plan also avoids any provision that would force Ukraine to give up territory to the Russians. “As long as Zelensky is president, no one should count on us giving up territory,” Yermak said. “Nobody can do that unless they want to go against the Ukrainian constitution and the Ukrainian people.”

Read: Ukraine says it won’t give up land to Russia

Yermak’s successor, Kyrylo Budanov, a lieutenant general and spymaster who now leads Ukraine’s negotiating team, has been more amenable to compromises, even on the question of territory. He has presided over long discussions with presidential aides about the legal and practical conditions necessary for Ukraine to withdraw from some parts of the Donetsk region without allowing the Russians to advance and seize it. “They’re really being creative, looking for how to do it in a way that people would accept,” one official who participated in these sessions told me.

Meanwhile, Zelensky has made a convincing show of agreeing to Trump’s peace initiatives, even when they seemed unworkable or ill-conceived. He entertained the idea of turning parts of the Donetsk region into a “free economic zone” that neither Russian nor Ukrainian forces would control. “We weren’t thrilled about that,” Zelensky said. But he went along with the American proposals, doing his best to demonstrate that Russia, not Ukraine, remains the obstacle to peace. “Sometimes I get the impression that it’s like: What else can we offer the Ukrainians just to see if they’ll refuse?” he said with a smile. “We’re not afraid of anything. Are we ready for elections? We’re ready. Are we ready for a referendum? We’re ready.”

But, as ever with Zelensky, there are conditions and caveats. Any terms related to the loss of land, for example, can be resolved only when Zelensky and Putin meet face-to-face. The Americans have long proposed such a summit, and Trump has said he would be ready to mediate. The Kremlin, for its part, has urged the Ukrainians to come to Moscow, knowing Zelensky would not agree to that venue out of principle.

On the morning of our interview, the Financial Times reported that on February 24, the four-year anniversary of the Russian invasion, Zelensky would announce plans to hold presidential elections and a referendum on a peace agreement. Citing anonymous sources, the report even includes a deadline of May 15 for staging the vote. When I asked about this, Zelensky sighed and shook his head. “No one is clinging to power,” he said. “I am ready for elections. But for that we need security, guarantees of security, a cease-fire.”

It reminded me of the time in early 2022 when the White House was warning Zelensky of an imminent invasion, and President Biden, during a call with Western leaders, predicted that it would begin on February 16. Zelensky refused to believe it. Instead of mobilizing his military or calling on people to evacuate, he urged all Ukrainians to hang flags in their windows and sing the national anthem at 10 that morning. “We are told that February 16 will be the day of the attack,” Zelensky declared in a defiant speech. “We will make it the day of unity.”

The invasion began a little more than a week later, and it quickly turned into a disaster for the Russians. They lost the Battle of Kyiv that spring and the Battle of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, that September. A few weeks later, when Ukrainian forces evicted the Russians from the southern city of Kherson, Zelensky received an urgent plea from one of his closest Western allies: Begin peace talks now from a position of strength, and use the leverage to secure a favorable deal. “Seize the moment,” General Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech in November 2022.

No one can say whether such talks could have ended the war. But looking back, that was the high-water mark for Ukraine’s successes on the battlefield. The war devolved afterward into a series of demoralizing setbacks for Ukraine, starting with a failed counteroffensive in 2023, when most of the front line settled into a stalemate. Neither side has since been able to break through the other’s fortified defenses and seize large chunks of territory for long. Over time, Ukraine’s strength has eroded, resulting in a weaker position from which to negotiate a truce. Does Zelensky regret it? Does he wish he had taken that chance to make a deal at the end of 2022?

“We’ve never been against ending the war. It’s the Russians who have shown they are not ready for a dialogue,” he said. After a pause to weigh his words, he added, “Today there are new people, with a different outlook on things.” He meant the people around Trump, who seem more interested in striking a deal ahead of the midterm elections than in making Ukrainians feel certain of their safety. But if Zelensky has any regrets about leaving the peace process in the hands of this administration, he kept them to himself.

As we stood to say goodbye, I saw General Budanov, the newly appointed chief of staff, standing in the anteroom, stone-faced, with a folder tucked under one arm. The rest of the negotiating team soon arrived, still fresh from their trip to Abu Dhabi. They would spend the afternoon preparing for the talks scheduled for next week. “Greetings,” the president said, standing next to the unruly pile of documents and briefing books that crowds his desk. “What’s new?”

Maybe one of the men filing into his office had a fresh idea for a breakthrough. But as they took their seats around Zelensky’s conference table and shut the door behind me, it seemed much more likely that they would talk in circles, looking for ways to inch closer to a deal as Russia continues its slow, implacable assault.</div>

            <h2>James Van Der Beek’s Greatest Trick</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/james-van-der-beek-best-role/685973/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adolescence, as life phases go, is not especially easy to idealize. Dawson’s Creek, though, found a way. The ’90s-era soap opera, disguised as a gauzy coming-of-age drama, gave us the fictional Capeside, Massachusetts, a telegenically rustic hamlet populated by telegenically precocious teenagers—chief among them Dawson Leery, a dreamy filmmaker in the making, who spent six TV seasons angsting and aching his way into the hearts of the show’s young audience.

Dawson was strong and sensitive in equal measure. He was a thoroughly nice guy in a show that refused to treat that status as an insult. He was as thoroughly fantastical as the series that shared his name. But the character worked—and the show worked with him—because, against all odds, he seemed so warm and real. That is mostly because he was played by James Van Der Beek.

Van Der Beek died yesterday at the age of 48, after announcing in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. The actor leaves behind a large family—he and his wife, Kimberly, had six children—and a legacy that extends far beyond the character who made him, for a certain generation of TV viewers, an icon.

Dawson’s ended its run in 2003; Van Der Beek, having achieved something at the start of his career that most actors spend their lives pursuing, might have gone on to seek lucrative reprisals of his famous role. Instead, for the most part, the actor left Capeside, choosing work that demonstrated his remarkable versatility. He did comedy and drama and romance. He did film and TV. He played Jonathan “Mox” Moxon, the restless quarterback of Varsity Blues. And Elijah Mundo, the FBI agent of CSI: Cyber. And Matt Bromley, the oversexed and undershamed executive of Pose.

His best role, though, found Van Der Beek playing himself.

Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, an ABC sitcom whose awkward title belied its easy charm, ran from 2012 to 2014. A gender-flipped and gimlet-eyed update of The Odd Couple, the show starred Krysten Ritter as Chloe, a New Yorker with a habit of ruining her roommates’ lives, and Dreama Walker as June, the wide-eyed, Midwestern-bred woman who gets caught in Chloe’s chaos. But the series also starred, delightfully, James Van Der Beek, who made regular, scene-stealing appearances as Chloe’s best friend—the actor James Van Der Beek.

TV James is an actor and celebrity who is self-conscious and vain in equal measure: a Hollywood stereotype let loose on the streets of New York. TV James carries glossy headshots around with him to distribute, magnanimously, to wayward fans. TV James is engaged in a long-running and passionately petty feud with the actor Dean Cain (played, yes, by the actor Dean Cain). TV James, eager to de-Dawson his personal brand, lends his name to a line of absurdly skinny jeans (tagline: “Put your cheeks in a Beek!”). TV James can think of no higher aspiration than a seasonal appearance on Dancing With the Stars.

The actor who plays himself is an age-old trope. Since well before Larry David came along, celebrities have been breaking their own life’s fourth wall and finding comedy among the wreckage. Van Der Beek, during his Dawson’s run, made a self-referential appearance in the film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back—his own early attempt, perhaps, to de-Dawson himself.

In Apartment 23, though, he found new verve in the old joke. Having ascended into the sitcom’s semi-fictional form, he created a character who was prickly and smarmy and needy and whiny, and thus richly emblematic of Hollywood then and now. He mocked his industry. He mocked his fame. He mocked himself. (TV James’s overzealous preparations for Dancing With the Stars are, in retrospect, all the funnier, and all the deeper, because Van Der Beek the person eventually appeared on the show.) He remade himself as a human punch line, gamely and, in the end, effectively—playing someone who, through all his flaws, turned a clever but otherwise standard-issue sitcom into a satire.

TV James, like Dawson, is more resonant than he has any right to be. On paper—as scripted—he is aggressively unrelatable. (“I have too much money,” he grouses at one point; “my wallet’s so thick that it’s hurting my back!”) On-screen, though, his plight reverberates. TV James, like Dawson, is trapped in arrested development, perpetually caught between adolescence and adulthood. Underneath his foolishness, he is consigned to an all-too-relatable fate: He is unsure how to reconcile the person he was with the person he wants to become.

All the farce, in that way, hints at tragedy. And it does so because Van Der Beek, playing and mocking himself, also humanized himself. He re-created the magic that made Dawson’s Creek a cultural touchpoint. The show, in exaggerating adolescence—in remaking that consequential phase as a fantasy and a melodrama—also managed to honor it. It took teenagers seriously. Van Der Beek, twisting his remarkable life into a piece of comedy, pulled the same kind of trick. Poking fun at himself, he found something not only real—but also true.</div>

            <h2>The Tide Goes Out on Youth Gender Medicine</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ama-asps-gender-surgery-minors/685961/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the shaky evidence base for youth gender medicine has become better known, activists have retreated to an argument from authority. Never mind the Cass Report, whose findings resulted in the closure of Britain’s leading youth gender clinic. Never mind the study by a leading American practitioner showing that the treatments she championed did not improve minors’ mental health. Never mind reports that some adolescents were being put on a medical pathway after only a single clinic visit. For advocates, the important thing to remember was that “gender-affirming care” for minors—puberty blockers and hormones, plus surgery in rare cases—was endorsed by all of the major American medical associations.

“Doctors Agree,” proclaimed the American Civil Liberties Union: “Gender-Affirming Care Is Life-Saving Care.” GLAAD declared that “every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.” Fired up by the Republican “war on trans kids,” and naturally deferential to institutional authority, Democrats have tended to echo this line. At a 2023 congressional-subcommittee hearing on pediatric gender medicine, the ranking Democrat, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, declared that “gender-affirming care is safe and effective” and “supported by every major medical association”—groups that collectively count more than 1.3 million doctors as members. “It’s not up for debate,” she said. In line with this, Joe Biden’s administration lobbied to remove age minimums from the industry’s standards of care.

Today, though, the future of medical transition for minors is up for debate. On February 3, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons recommended that “surgeons delay gender-related breast/chest, genital, and facial surgery until a patient is at least 19 years old.” The next day, the American Medical Association, the country’s largest organization representing doctors, endorsed that view: “In the absence of clear evidence, the A.M.A. agrees with A.S.P.S. that surgical interventions in minors should be generally deferred to adulthood.” These statements echo what skeptics of American youth gender medicine have been saying for years: The evidence of the benefits and risks of mastectomies and other surgeries is insufficient to justify their use as treatments for gender dysphoria, and follow-up data on those who have undergone the procedures are scant.

Helen Lewis: The liberal misinformation bubble about youth gender medicine

More significant, the ASPS statement explicitly endorses the conclusions of the Cass Report and the evidence review commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services last year. LGBTQ groups and gender clinicians have dismissed both of these documents as fuel for right-wing attacks on care, even though Hilary Cass was a nonpartisan retired pediatrician, and most of the HHS report authors were self-described liberals and Democrats. But the ASPS references both warmly, and bases its new guidelines on the research carried out by the official British and American inquiries. “Both the Cass Review and the HHS report emphasize that the natural course of pediatric gender dysphoria remains poorly understood,” notes the ASPS statement. “Available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of children with prepubertal onset gender dysphoria experience resolution or significant reduction of distress by the time they reach adulthood, absent medical or surgical intervention.” Put simply, that is an American doctors’ organization acknowledging that gender dysphoria frequently resolves itself without treatment—a challenge to the idea that children’s new identities should be uncritically endorsed.

I don’t want to overstate what has happened here: The ASPS has been more cautious than other groups for many months now, and its new positions are limited in scope. Gender surgeries on minors were never offered by Britain’s health service, and only a few thousand have been performed in the United States, according to a 2023 study. The ASPS statement also cites “insufficient evidence demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio” for hormone treatments, but does not explicitly recommend against them. Yet the organization’s stance still represents a shift away from the purely affirmative model, in which saying no is never a clinician’s job. Notably, the group reminds members that “plastic surgeons cannot rely on the presence of a prior medical intervention, referral, or letter of support as a proxy for surgical indication or adolescent readiness.”

This matters, because the idea of performing mastectomies on girls as young as 13 became a powerful symbol of a clique of doctors who could not be trusted to regulate themselves. The Miami surgeon Sidhbh Gallagher became known on TikTok for her catchphrase “yeet the teet,” referring to mastectomies, and for calling herself “Dr. Teetus Deletus.” The detransitioner Chloe Cole, who has testified in favor of state bans on pediatric gender medicine, received a double mastectomy at 15. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who formerly worked at the gender clinic of the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, was the lead author on a paper recommending that mastectomies be offered based on “individual need rather than chronologic age.” She once boasted at a seminar that she did not worry about regret: “If you want breasts at a later point in your life, you can go and get them.”

Unfortunately, things are not that simple. In a recent lawsuit in New York State, a detransitioner called Fox Varian testified that she’d had her breasts removed at 16, only 11 months after first identifying as male. She had also been diagnosed with autism and had struggled with an eating disorder and anxiety. By the time of the surgery, she had changed her name twice already. Varian asserted, according to the reporter Benjamin Ryan, who attended the trial, that her doctor “served as an enabler, repeatedly assuring her that the mastectomy she desired would greatly improve her well-being.” Varian told the court that she regretted the surgery instantly, and detransitioned three years later. She was awarded $2 million in damages. The court heard that she had been left with scarring and a lack of sensation, and would be unable to breastfeed.

Varian’s lawsuit also claimed that doctors encouraged her mother to approve the surgery by invoking the specter of suicide. As I wrote last year, the idea of youth gender medicine as “lifesaving”—for the prevention of suicide—has been key to overriding parents’ understandable concerns about these treatments. But this is another activist talking point that has begun to crumble. In front of the Supreme Court, the ACLU’s Chase Strangio conceded that there was no evidence to support the assertion that transition prevents suicide, because “completed suicide, thankfully and admittedly, is rare.” He argued that instead it reduced suicidal thoughts—a significant climbdown from the once-popular assertion that parents had to choose between “a dead son and a living daughter,” and vice versa. His concession helped expose this rhetoric as the emotional blackmail that it always was.

Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won’t end there

The tide is now going out on the affirmative approach to youth gender medicine as practiced in America. “I stopped the mutilation of children,” Donald Trump told a prayer breakfast on February 5. Twenty-seven states have placed restrictions on the medical pathway, while gender clinics in blue cities such as Los Angeles have shut down under Trump’s threat of funding cuts to their host institutions. Now the success of such a high-profile detransitioner lawsuit—one of more than two dozen currently under way, according to Ryan—will make the remaining affirmative clinicians nervous.

Frankly, they should be nervous. As the field has received more scrutiny, advocates have begun to stress the need for careful assessments, even though American providers in the 2010s largely rejected this essential feature of the Dutch protocol, the medical treatment for youth gender dysphoria developed in Europe in the 1990s. Today, when Democrats defend youth gender medicine, they tend to do so on the basis of individual freedom rather than the effectiveness of the treatments themselves. In 2024, a brief signed by 11 Democratic senators and 153 Democratic House members urged the Supreme Court not to uphold Tennessee’s ban on youth medical transition. The state law “intrudes on an individual’s decisions about their own medical care, made in partnership with their medical providers,” the signatories said.

All of this represents a clear retrenchment from the 2010s and early 2020s. The excesses of that era prompted a backlash that fueled the current MAGA demonization of gender nonconformity. The story of youth gender medicine is one of good intentions, arrogance, fear, and polarization. It is also an avoidable tragedy.</div>

            <h2>Trump Has a Bridge He Wants to Sell You</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/trump-detroit-windsor-bridge/685967/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The president of the United States became aware Monday evening, apparently for the first time, that a new bridge is set to open between Michigan and Ontario. The project promises to create a fast and inexpensive route that Michigan’s farmers and businesses have sought for decades.

Donald Trump decided this could not stand.

In a typically discursive social-media post, Trump announced, “I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.” The post also predicts that ice hockey will soon be banned in Canada as a result of its trade agreement with China. On the plus side, it does refer to Canada as a “Country” rather than, as the president has enjoyed describing it, a state.

On the surface, this looked to be just one more Trumpian tantrum, the kind that regularly pops up when he sees something distressing on television or is spoken to by a woman without the self-abasement he demands.

But subsequent reporting suggests that this was something even worse: an episode that sums up Trumpian economics in all its stupidity and atavistic sleaze.

Hours before Trump’s post, according to The New York Times, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick met with Matthew Moroun, the owner of a competing bridge between Michigan and Ontario. Lutnick then spoke with the president by phone. You might wonder why a major international bridge has an owner when such things are ordinarily in public hands. The answer is that the Ambassador Bridge was privately constructed, and for decades has stood as the sole trucking link from Detroit to Windsor, a key thoroughfare for national and international commerce. If you want to travel from Michigan to, say, Boston, your fastest route runs through Canada.

The Ambassador Bridge gets clogged with traffic and charges expensive tolls, which Moroun is able to compel because his customers have no practical alternative. A separate tunnel connects Detroit and Windsor, but larger trucks can’t use it. Moroun’s family has spent decades and millions of dollars trying to keep things that way, relentlessly lobbying to block construction of a second bridge desired by drivers and merchants on both sides of the Detroit River.

A breakthrough arrived in 2012. Rick Snyder, a Republican who was then Michigan’s governor, cut a deal with Canada to build the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Snyder had to work around the recalcitrant Michigan legislature, which had been plied with Moroun donations, by using executive authority. The terms of the deal required Canada to finance all construction costs. Canada is permitted to collect full tolls until it recoups its investment, and ownership of the bridge is to be split equally.

The project would unlock billions of dollars in savings for consumers and businesses. The sole loser is Moroun, a billionaire whose fortune rests on rent seeking. Now that the bridge construction is essentially complete and set to finally open, Moroun has gone to the administration, and Trump has shut down his competition.

Trump’s stated demands to open the bridge are a mixture of fantasy and contrived grievance. Trump complains in his post that the bridge was built without American material, which is false, and insists, “With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,” which is already the case.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, attempting to add a sheen of rationality to the president’s ultimatum, said, “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.” This is a difficult requirement to meet unless Canada decides to tear down the bridge and rebuild it with more American-made material.

Trump’s post also requires, as a condition of opening the new bridge, that Canada give the United States more “respect.” One way other countries have demonstrated respect to Trump has been furnishing him with expensive gifts or investing in his family businesses. Canada’s rules against bribery make this negotiation shortcut more difficult.

Franklin Foer: Why the Gulf monarchs shower Trump with gifts

This episode is a prototypical demonstration of Trump’s economic worldview. Faced with a policy choice that pits the interests of millions of people against the wealth of a single rent seeker, Trump has intervened in a way that benefits the billionaire.

The insight that the free exchange of goods and services has positive-sum benefits—a core tenet of market economics—has always eluded Trump. His instincts are not capitalistic but pre-capitalistic. He has the mentality of a Renaissance baron, hoarding power and collecting tribute rather than innovating and creating wealth.

The president may be hurting a foreign country, but that does not mean he is helping ours. He is shrinking the pie, while delivering a larger slice of it to a Trumpian oligarch.</div>

            <h2>The Multibillion-Dollar Foundation That Controls the Humanities</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/mellon-foundation-humanities-research-funding/685733/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1964, an influential report identified a disquieting trend in academia. “Increasingly during the past few years,” it began, “concern has been expressed about the condition, in this country, of those fields of intellectual activity generally called the humanities.” The 200-plus-page document was a publication of the National Commission on the Humanities, which had been established the previous year.

Reading the commission’s findings six decades later, one could reasonably conclude that what today gets called the “crisis of the humanities” is not so much a discrete 21st-century emergency as the latest expression of an educational catastrophe long in the making. The challenges outlined in 1964 are familiar: meager funding, insufficient support for graduate students, too few faculty jobs, an education system that glamorizes science and math, dense writing that alienates the public, and on and on. “The state of the humanities today creates a crisis,” the report concluded. “There is genuine doubt today whether the universities and colleges can insure that the purposes for which they were established and sometimes endowed will be fulfilled.”

This doubt has not much diminished in the intervening decades, nor have the problems the report identified. Yet what is most notable in the report is not these similarities, but the commission’s prescient fear that the solutions to what ailed the humanities—namely, more cash and large-scale institutional support—also carried risks. “For the very reason that the humanities are concerned with quality, with values, with emotions, and with the goals of living, they must remain free,” the report proclaimed. “To control them is to dictate opinion and to subject all men to the tyranny of a controlling authority in the most intimate and sacred concerns of our existence as human beings.”

The commission’s boldest recommendation was that a new, publicly funded national foundation be established to dispense money to the humanities. But it also cautioned that this path was fraught. The report argued that, although building a taxpayer-financed agency to support American arts and letters was necessary, no federal body should have a monopoly on this grant-making, lest the humanities become unduly influenced by politics. “We must unquestionably increase the prestige of the humanities and the flow of funds to them,” the commission wrote. “At the same time, however grave the need, we must safeguard the independence, the originality, and the freedom of expression of all who are concerned with liberal learning.”

The report recommended that federal funding for the humanities be supplemented by ideologically diverse, nongovernmental donors. “The day must never come when scholars and artists can look only to the federal government for the help they need,” it said. “The notion of any one ‘chosen instrument’ of government in this area must be abhorrent to anyone who cherishes the humanities and realizes that if they are not free they perish.”

Thomas Chatterton Williams: Stop trying to make the humanities ‘relevant’

For a while, things seemed to go more or less according to the commission’s plan. President Lyndon B. Johnson established the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 in direct response to the report. A few years later, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was created to finance American arts and letters. It would become part of a broader network that included the Ford Foundation, which began funding the humanities in the 1950s, and the John Templeton Foundation, which began funding research in religion and philosophy in the 1980s. The benefaction of these private nonprofits eventually came to exceed, by a substantial margin, the money dispensed by the government, which has declined over time.

In recent decades, though, the priorities of many of these nonprofits have shifted. The Atlantic Philanthropies, a onetime stalwart, reduced its funding for the humanities in the 1990s. The Rockefeller Foundation began moving away from humanities funding in the 2000s. In 2022, the Ford Foundation announced plans to drastically reduce its higher-education funding in order to focus on racial-justice-movement building. With the broader ecosystem of humanities-focused philanthropies all but dried up, only one major private grant-maker is left standing.

Today, no single entity, including the federal government, has a more profound influence on the fiscal health and cultural output of the humanities than the Mellon Foundation. The National Endowment for the Humanities’ grant budget was $78 million in 2024 (its overall budget was less than half of what it was in 1980, when adjusted for inflation). Mellon awarded $540 million in grants that same year; its endowment sits at roughly $8 billion.

Mellon’s largesse is badly needed, especially as the Trump administration has threatened further cuts to the NEH. But the foundation’s virtual monopoly on humanities funding means that it has the power to remake entire fields according to its desires. And in recent years, under the leadership of Elizabeth Alexander, who became the organization’s president in 2018, Mellon has embraced an understanding of the humanities that is much more utilitarian, and far more political, than the one put forward by the 1964 commission. In June 2020, Mellon announced that it would be “prioritizing social justice in all of its grantmaking”—“a major strategic evolution” for the organization. This new paradigm seems to find value in arts and letters only insofar as they advance approved, left-leaning causes.

Over the past decade or so, conservative critics of higher education have tended to offer a rather simple explanation for the humanities’ decline. Their argument amounts to a version of “go woke, go broke.” According to this theory, ultraprogressive faculty coalesced around an unpopular liberal orthodoxy, turning off undergraduates (and the public) and accelerating the humanities’ collapse. In short, Shakespeare was replaced by jargon-laden prattle about “settler colonialism,” and students took their tuition dollars to more sane, less shrill corners of universities.

But this tale places too much of the blame on humanities professors, overestimating their actual power within institutions. More important, the went-woke-went-broke hypothesis does not account for the ways that economic transformations within higher education have accelerated the trends that conservatives lament. Specifically, the right-wing theory of the case gets the causal arrow wrong. The humanities aren’t broke because they went woke. The humanities went woke in large part because they were broke. As other donors, the government, and universities themselves all but abandoned these fields, Mellon became a lifeline. But the foundation has proved to be—as Jacques Derrida might have said—a kind of pharmakon: a Greek word that the philosopher noted could be translated as either “remedy” or “poison,” depending on your perspective.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

The 1964 report failed to anticipate that, in the 21st century, one of the most substantial challenges to the intellectual and political autonomy of the humanities would come not from a government agency, but from a private organization. American humanists now find themselves in a position that the report’s authors would have considered a nightmare: A multibillion-dollar politicized grant-making entity has a stranglehold over humanities research and teaching, and is using that power to push them in a direction that blurs the boundaries between scholarship and activism, pedagogy and politics.

Under Alexander’s leadership, even as it has cut back on funding for less political projects, Mellon has disbursed enormous sums of money to hyper-liberal academic initiatives at institutions both public and private. These have included grants to Portland State University to help its Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department become more “ungovernable,” creating “spaces where activism is encouraged” and “queer and feminist resistance” takes place; to Texas A&M at San Antonio for the Borderlands Shakespeare Colectiva (a group of academics and activists who “use Shakespeare to reimagine colonial histories and to envision socially just futures in La Frontera”); to Northwestern University for a project that explores how “Black dance practices” work to “instantiate Black freedom”; to Northeastern University for its Digital Transgender Archive to establish a new “lab” on the West Coast; and to UC Davis’s Department of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies to create a working group on “Trans Liberation in an Age of Fascism.”

One may feel a variety of ways about the worldview that Mellon has chosen to promote through its grant-making. But the salient question is not whether its politics are laudable or lamentable, or even whether the projects it funds are beneficial. The real questions are: What are the consequences when eye-watering sums of money are put behind the idea that the purpose of American arts and letters is not wisdom but advocacy? What happens when the humanities are seen not as having intrinsic worth, but as valuable only insofar as they can be of service to a cause? And what happens when the “choice” of whether to accede to this vision of the humanities becomes—when there is only one real funding game in town—a matter of survival versus collapse?

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was established in 1969, when two siblings—Ailsa Mellon Bruce, a socialite and an art collector, and Paul Mellon, an art collector and a racehorse breeder—decided to combine their personal charitable outfits in honor of their late industrialist father. Their new organization would fund American arts and letters, eventually including foreign-language programs, university special collections, tenure-track positions for new humanities professors, graduate fellowships for Ph.D. students, archival research, and more.

Even before its recent pivot, Mellon tended to tilt to the left, perhaps as a kind of compensation for, or a distraction from, the unseemly reality that it is a multibillion-dollar foundation created by the patrician offspring of a robber baron. But although some of its endeavors through the years were expressly social-justice-oriented (such as a 2016 grant for Columbia’s “Facing Whiteness” project, an interdisciplinary study of how white Americans think about their racial identity), others were more traditional (a long-standing relationship with the Folger Shakespeare Library, for example).

In many ways, the role that liberal politics and social justice should play in higher education has been a preoccupation of the country’s colleges and universities since the mid-20th century. Like cicadas, controversies tend to pop up every decade or so. There was William F. Buckley Jr.’s panic about “collectivism” in the Ivy League, documented in his 1951 book, God and Man at Yale. There were the campus free-speech and civil-rights movements of the 1960s, many of which led to the establishment of identity-focused humanities departments. Then came the fights over political correctness, multiculturalism, and the literary canon in the ’80s and ’90s associated with conservative intellectuals such as Allan Bloom and Roger Kimball. Christopher Rufo’s “critical race theory” dissension kicked off the 2020s, giving way to disputes over wokeness and anti-wokeness. Lately, American campuses have been dominated by the debates around decolonial theory and free speech that emerged from the Gaza crisis.

From the November 1951 issue: A review of William F. Buckley Jr.’s attack on Yale

The cumulative effect of these skirmishes has been to weaken the humanities’ already vulnerable stock with the public. American culture treats the arts, ideas, and literature as luxury goods that can be cast aside during moments of belt-tightening, and post-2008 austerity measures have hit the humanities hard, resulting in budget cuts, vanished tenure lines, dwindling research funds, and diminished federal dollars. In a 2024 article for an academic journal, the literary scholar Christopher Newfield showed how few resources are allocated to basic humanities research in the United States. “Of the $54 billion or so in research that the federal government funds in U.S. higher education, $69 million goes to the humanities,” he wrote. “That is, the humanities receive 0.13% of the federal total.”

These economic woes have been exacerbated by the fact that, especially after the Great Recession, students and parents have placed even more emphasis on “practical” college majors that offered a strong “return on investment.” Unable to compete with STEM or business-adjacent fields in the hallowed category of “Making a Ton of Money After Graduation,” the humanities gradually settled into a sales pitch to justify the expense of a degree: The English or history or philosophy department will help turn you into A Good Person. The ROI of a humanities degree was not economic, the thinking went, but political and moral. This was the context in which Elizabeth Alexander became Mellon’s president, in 2018.

Alexander’s pedigree made her a natural choice to lead the foundation. Born to Clifford L. Alexander Jr.—a Kennedy-administration official and the first Black secretary of the Army—and Adele Logan Alexander, a noted historian, she has spent a lifetime in elite institutions: Sidwell Friends. Yale. Boston University to study poetry with Derek Walcott. A Ph.D. in English from the University of Pennsylvania. A stint as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. Followed by Smith. Followed by Yale (again). Followed by reciting her own poetry at Barack Obama’s first inauguration (“In today’s sharp sparkle, this winter air, / any thing can be made, any sentence begun. / On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp”). A stint as the Ford Foundation’s director of creativity and (ironically) free expression after that. Then Mellon.

Benjamin Schmidt: The humanities are in crisis

Alexander reportedly said in her interviews for the role that she planned to pivot the foundation’s attention to social-justice work, and she has kept her word. “There won’t be a penny that is going out the door that is not contributing to a more fair, more just, more beautiful society,” she declared in 2020.

To better understand the impact of Mellon’s agenda, I spoke with about 20 people who have had close dealings with the foundation. Some are professors; others are senior administrators who act as middlemen between their institution and donors and grant-makers. Several have been interacting with Mellon for a decade or more. They are employed at a variety of institutions, some public and some private, some generously endowed and others more threadbare. Most agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity. “I don’t think I want to go on the record,” a historian told me, “because Mellon is very powerful.”

One scholar described a relationship with Mellon that was as personal as it was professional. Decades ago, a Mellon fellowship paid for her to pursue a Ph.D. in 19th-century literature. “It changed my life,” she said. Later, when she was a new faculty member, a second Mellon grant enabled her to conduct research for her first book. The sort of work she did was traditional, historically minded, and apolitical, and she noted that she benefited from Mellon’s old approach to funding, in which “classic subjects were the norm.”

When I asked her how she felt about the organization’s turn toward social-justice work, she seemed ambivalent. She was open to Mellon’s new direction, but she also worried that the focus on progressive issues in academia had become “all-encompassing” and made the humanities a target of political criticism. I heard similar concerns from others.

A director responsible for grant administration at a small college said that humanities professors at her institution were distraught by Mellon’s new focus, which they saw as coming at the expense of areas of inquiry without obvious social-justice relevance. She characterized some of the reactions she’s heard: “Are you saying that it’s no longer valuable that I’m doing research on these texts from this time to see what I can learn about them? Is that not valuable anymore to anyone?”

This director described a difficult conversation with a religious-studies professor who was excited about a new project. She told him that it had little chance of getting funding from Mellon, because, as the director put it, “it was purely research. It had nothing to do with community partners or racial justice.” She tried to let him down gently, but said it was like watching the air go out of a balloon.

I became a tenure-track humanities professor in 2020, and I remember Mellon’s shift being greeted with some quiet concern that funding in more traditional research areas would lapse. I saw an example of this several years ago, when a senior academic I know well was seeking research funding for a book project that had nothing to do with social justice. Forced to choose between forgoing an opportunity to win a badly needed grant and twisting his research into a social-justice pretzel, he opted for the pretzel, amending the project to focus on race in an unsuccessful bid to win the foundation’s favor. Another humanities academic I spoke with confessed that, like my acquaintance, he had reimagined his work to focus more squarely on race; he did win a grant. I suspect that this may not be a rare occurrence.

One professor told me that, after he and his colleagues were turned down for various Mellon grants, a representative from the foundation began helping them draft a new proposal that would more likely be approved. “We were pretty tightly coached,” he said. “It certainly felt like we were being told, ‘Do this, this, and this in order for it to work on our end.’ ” Ultimately, he said, a fair amount of social-justice jargon was tacked on to the proposal, “in consultation with, or perhaps at the insistence of, the representative from Mellon.” His team won the grant. (Asked to comment on this, Mellon responded in a statement to The Atlantic, “We firmly support intellectual and academic freedom.” The foundation also said that, “as a private charitable organization, we exercise our freedom to support projects in alignment with our mission.”)

It is hard to see how an incentive structure that pushes scholars to fake or fudge an interest in social justice helps produce a more just academy. If anything, this seems likely to further entrench higher education’s tendency to confuse performative preening with real societal improvement. It also effaces the difference between serious scholarship on race, colonialism, or gender and gaseous buzzword-mongering.

When I was pursuing a Ph.D. in comparative literature in the 2010s, Mellon’s Dissertation Completion Fellowship program provided essential financial support to graduate students finishing their studies. There were no substantive constraints on the subject areas that could be covered; awardees worked on topics as diverse as 15th-century women’s devotional literature, Descartes’ conception of infinity, temporal clauses in linguistics, and hacking culture in contemporary Mexico. In 2022, however, that program was eliminated.

Mellon’s newer Dissertation Innovation Fellowship focuses on “supporting scholars who can build a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable academy.” The guidelines list “thoughtful engagement with communities that are historically underrepresented in higher education” as one of the primary criteria used to evaluate the strength of an application; by my count, all 45 of the 2025 awardees work on issues of identity or social or environmental justice. The fellowship is explicitly “designed to intervene” before a student’s research direction is finalized, which means, in practice, that Mellon can steer students who are just beginning to settle on a dissertation topic toward its preferred areas of inquiry.

In an alternate universe, with ample humanities funding for less politically salient work, one might see the fellowship program as an unalloyed good, providing support to projects that have not historically enjoyed sufficient resources. But in the funding landscape that actually exists, the reality is zero-sum. Every dollar that Mellon spends on this work is a dollar that it cannot spend on “non-applied” humanities research—in other words, scholarship for scholarship’s sake that has no aim except to expand knowledge.

Some may argue that this trade-off is prudent. From my perspective, however, the gift of the humanities is that they liberate us from the tyranny of present opinion and the views of those in power—including those who sit atop multibillion-dollar philanthropies. A version of the humanities that sees its chief mandate as finding solutions to pragmatic problems doesn’t ultimately seem all that different from the accounting department or business school.

I asked multiple times over the course of several months for an interview with Elizabeth Alexander, but through a spokesperson she refused to talk with me, a decision that highlights a broader set of problems within elite academic culture: a disinclination to be accountable to laypeople. A sense that private institutions, regardless of how much they influence the public, are entitled to push whatever ideologies they want. And a belief that it is perfectly natural for higher education to have a liberal slant because everything good and decent has a liberal slant. (Alexander sent along a handful of comments through a spokesperson shortly before this issue went to press. “At Mellon, grantmaking is guided not by ideology,” she wrote, “but by the powerful ideal that the rich fabric of America’s cultural and intellectual contributions must be broadened to convey the full scale of our nation’s histories, surface new ideas, and challenge long-held assumptions.”)

Alexander’s appointment to Mellon also speaks to another trend I’ve observed within wealthy liberal institutions, in which people of color from unusually privileged backgrounds are anointed as standard-bearers for a radical cultural worldview that many working-class minorities do not share—even as the former are ostensibly intended to “represent” the latter. Of course, it is not Alexander’s fault that she is the daughter of illustrious parents. Or that she is a descendant of the Logan family, a famous lineage of highly educated Black elites whose influence stretches back to the 19th century. Or that she is a longtime personal friend of the Obamas, or that her brother served on Barack Obama’s transition team ahead of his first inauguration, where she read her poem “Praise Song for the Day.”

But these facts are also not irrelevant to her elevation at Mellon, by whom she was paid $1.53 million in direct compensation and $672,785 in other compensation in 2024. I have no objection to poets making rookie-NFL-player money—though her 2024 salary is the equivalent of about 16 average tenure-track professors’ annual pay—but it does make all of the social-justice posturing a little more comical.

Various people I spoke with said that Alexander has remade Mellon according to her values, pushing the foundation to become ever more devoted to a narrow conception of progress. A senior official in charge of grant administration at a small private college noted that Alexander has brought a new style of leadership to the foundation, wielding more top-down bureaucratic control and pushing more sweeping changes than past presidents have. Others agreed with this characterization.

This is a significant departure from the nonprofit’s past approach to managing relationships with the institutions it funds, in which Mellon officials would try to balance a college’s or university’s particular—often less political—needs against its own ideological priorities. In 2023, the foundation allotted $1 million to “deepen the ongoing conversation in Transgender Studies” at the University of Kansas—specifically, to “establish a cohort model for scholar-activists” and “create a more trans-liberatory local and regional landscape.” Another $1 million went to classics professors at Princeton and Brown for a project called Racing the Classics, devoted to encouraging early-career scholars to implement “critical race approaches and curricular experimentation.” In 2024, Loyola Marymount University won a three-year, $431,000 grant to “bridge AI practitioners and disability justice scholars and activists.” And MIT received $500,000 for something called Engaging With Music and Musicking Through Engagement, aimed at correcting its curriculum’s “Western European biases.”

Whether or not these programs and projects are serious, significant contributions to humanities scholarship and teaching is somewhat beside the point. Even assuming that the undertakings are all worthwhile, the volume of financial support directed at the “scholar activism” model, at a moment when other, more time-honored varieties of humanities education are withering away, is cause for concern. Majors such as English, philosophy, and theater belong to an ever-shrinking number of fields that are not squarely devoted to job-market preparation or “skill building,” fields that aspire to do something loftier than clearing the brush from students’ career pathways. The merging of humanistic work and activism represents a surrender to the utilitarian logic that measures the worth of knowledge by its direct impact on “the real world.”

Mellon itself disputes this notion. A spokesperson connected me with Phillip Brian Harper, the foundation’s program director for higher learning, who said, “Social justice is a fuzzy term that people invest with a range of different meanings that don’t necessarily apply to the way we do grant-making.” He argued that Mellon’s focus is on emerging fields that have not received grant money in the past, regardless of their particular political bent. “Now, it does so happen that a lot of historically underfunded fields entail scholarly work that itself has social-justice objectives in mind,” he conceded. “But that’s a separate thing.”

This is quite obviously nonsense. Harper himself published an opinion article in 2022 titled “Studying Humanities Can Prepare the Next Generation of Social Justice Leaders.” “The country’s next generation of leaders is pushing for racial equity, economic equality, disability justice and gender and sexual liberation,” he wrote. “To succeed they will need the observational and analytical skills that can be developed by studying ideas, historical events, aesthetic works and cultural practices”—in other words, by studying the humanities. In this context, it seems clear that “social justice work” does indeed mean “activism.”

Some of Mellon’s recent grants have the potential to remake liberal-arts education entirely. The foundation’s Humanities for All Times project, launched in 2021, is premised on the notion that “today’s humanities undergrads are tomorrow’s social justice leaders.” Over the past several years, the foundation has regularly invited small cohorts of liberal-arts colleges to apply for grants—up to $1.5 million each—that support social-justice-aligned curricular development. The application guidelines note that “submissions oriented toward revising an institution’s entire general education program are especially welcome.” That is to say, college administrators and academics are encouraged to submit proposals for projects that would overhaul their core requirements for all students, in every major, in the service of a progressive political program.

A 2021 Humanities for All Times grant proposal from Colorado College reads like conservative satire: “We recognize the myriad ways in which white supremacy has shaped our institution and have been taking steps to work our way out of its grip,” it confesses near the beginning. The application promises the introduction of “at least 50 new and relevant courses” to “empower students to be changemakers.” Mellon gave the college $1 million to carry out this work.

In the summer of 2023, Colorado College hosted a conference based on this prompt: “How do the humanities contribute to anti-oppressive work, and how can humanities methods—from inquiry and critique to creative production and performance—dismantle systems of oppression, create and sustain community and solidarity, and advance liberation?” It does not seem to occur to those asking such questions that the humanities may not be especially well equipped to “dismantle systems of oppression.” Nor do they seem to consider that what might in fact be most valuable about fields like English, history, and philosophy is that they aspire to stand above the flotsam and jetsam of our immediate circumstances, and instead set their sights on what the classicist Leo Strauss called the “permanent problems” that have troubled human beings from time immemorial.

As easy as it is to point to cartoonishly progressive things that Mellon has funded, it is also true that, under Alexander, the foundation deserves credit for working to create a more economically just landscape within higher education. Before Alexander’s arrival, Mellon tended to disburse lavish funding to institutions that were already rich. Now, as part of Mellon’s commitment to equity, it is making a conscious effort to provide funding to public and less selective institutions. It has also increased funding for university-led prison education programs.

In 2024, Mellon spent $25 million to fund paid internships for undergraduate humanities students at five public colleges and universities. These internships can be in any field, with no particular ideological or social-justice strings attached. Renata Miller, a dean at the City College of New York, was effusive about the $5 million internship grant it received. She told me that the money helps provide support for child care, commuting costs, and other obstacles that can prevent working-class students from taking internships.

Elizabeth Spiller, the arts-and-sciences dean at the University of South Florida, wrote in a press release that she was stunned her school was even asked to apply for a similar program. USF ultimately received a $4.8 million grant, which can fund up to 900 students a year to take otherwise-unpaid internships.

Ironically, programs like this illustrate the bind in which both Mellon and the humanities writ large find themselves. It is hard to argue that the tens of millions of dollars that Mellon is putting toward internships for working-class kids at public colleges and universities would be better spent financing dusty archival research on 16th-century France. But this calculus also says something about the deeper structural problems of a model that pits various social goods—programs for humanities undergrads, resources for Ph.D. students, traditional humanities research, support for emerging fields and endowment-poor universities—against one another.

When I asked Harper how he feels about Mellon’s role as the country’s preeminent humanities funder, and the difficult choices that necessitates, he took issue with my characterization. “Serving in this way, that is not Mellon’s role,” he said. “Given the situation that we’re in, Mellon is accidentally in the position of being the primary large funder.” His point was that safeguarding the health of the humanities was not the foundation’s raison d’être, even if the decisions it makes affect that health directly.

This distinction helps shed light on the implicit question that underlies the entire debate about Mellon’s new focus. Namely, should the foundation be blamed for damaging the humanities by directing nearly half a billion dollars a year toward a social-justice-ified vision of American arts and letters, or should universities, the federal government, and other donors instead be blamed for not providing a healthier funding ecosystem to begin with, to say nothing of the anti-woke conservative billionaires who complain endlessly about the humanities and champion “the classics” without ever spending a single penny to support them?

“The sector needs to be taken by the collar and shaken very hard until resources that are adequate to the support of humanities doctoral students are jarred loose from higher-ed institutions themselves,” Harper said, growing animated. “The role of the Mellon Foundation is to catalyze that sort of change. It’s not to serve in perpetuity as the piggy bank for research.” Mellon, he said, was never supposed to be a panacea for the humanities.

But with the academic humanities in their death throes, Harper’s distinction between role and position may be largely beside the point. No, it is not Mellon’s job to be the humanities’ piggy bank. Yes, Mellon is the humanities’ piggy bank. The resulting situation is dismal, and the Trump administration’s funding cuts will only make things worse.

Yet the president’s attacks on the National Endowment for the Humanities and the canceling of federal humanities grants might not have the effect that conservatives hope for. Howard Husock, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, recently warned that gutting the NEH would simply expand the power vacuum for Mellon, and is likely to give the progressive organization even more sway over American arts and letters.

Some will no doubt feel that it is irresponsible to criticize Mellon at a moment when higher education is under assault from the federal government. That point of view is fair enough, I suppose, though I think it’s also misguided. The humanities’ problems began well before Donald Trump ever ran for office. The fantasy that we can put off these uncomfortable discussions—about Mellon, about the humanities, about the relationship between scholarship and activism—until some imagined time when higher education is in a healthier place strikes me as just that: a fantasy.

Read: American higher ed never figured out its purpose

The humanities are in the mess they’re in because of federal budget cuts, and because of administrators who care more about the football team than about William Faulkner, and because of the toxic pragmatism of an American culture that has a hard time valuing anything that is not immediately, aggressively useful. But the humanities are also in this mess because those of us who care about them have often preferred hunkering down in a defensive crouch, rattling our donation jars and begging for scraps, to serious soul-searching about the real purpose of American arts and letters. We have been too reluctant, or perhaps too ashamed, to consider whether we have betrayed the humanities’ very spirit in our mad, ever more futile quest to keep them financially solvent.

I often wonder what, exactly, we think we’re saving. Are the humanities as they are currently instantiated in the American university system actually worth the Faustian bargains we are forced to make to keep them? At their best, the humanities remind us that our problems are petty not because they are small, but because they are born of the same questions that have plagued all humans since our species lowered itself down from the trees and traded monkey chatter for wisdom-seeking: How to live virtuously? How to exist together peaceably? How to die with grace?

The humanities predate the modern university by millennia, and they will surely outlast it. But a higher-education system that can no longer keep them safe from the vulgarities of the market, the siren song of cultural warfare, or the decidedly sublunary work of furnishing political propaganda is one that has not just failed the humanities, but failed entirely.

            <h2>Why the U.S. Hasn’t Yet Struck Iran</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/iran-trump-war-us-israel-netanyahu/685970/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, President Trump took to social media to issue a not-at-all-veiled threat to the theocratic rulers of Iran: Come to the negotiating table and agree to “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS,” or risk the same type of swift and violent response that plucked Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Caracas in the middle of the night. “Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!”

Two weeks later, it suddenly isn’t. There is now “no rush” to make a deal, Trump said on Friday while speaking to reporters. Usually, threats of war come after talks fail, not before they have even started. But this time, the United States and Iran appear to have reset the clock just as the administration was at its most bellicose. So what happened?

The Trump administration had been considering its military options, which ranged from targeting leaders to hitting Iran’s nuclear program. But officials discovered that the U.S. could not conduct a major offensive as quickly as they had hoped without real risks to American forces, support from allies, and regional stability, two U.S. officials told us. Even though Trump has boasted about a “massive Armada” sprinting toward Iran, the U.S. does not have enough ships and planes in the region to conduct weeks of strikes, the officials said. It also does not have clear targets: The White House has yet to outline to military commanders what it would want to achieve through strikes, the officials said, suggesting that the use of force is not imminent.

Instead, the U.S. held direct talks with Iran over the weekend for the first time since last year. Admiral Brad Cooper, the top commander for Central Command, which is responsible for operations in the Middle East, was among the American officials present for the negotiations in Oman. The discussions allowed Iran to gauge U.S. interest in reaching a deal, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry said. The Trump administration publicly expressed optimism. But one official involved told us that the United States walked away with questions about whether Iran was “serious about negotiations or simply pursuing this course to buy additional time.”

Beyond a reprieve from military action, Iran wants relief from economic sanctions, but without constraints on its regional militias and giving up its right to enrich uranium and its arsenal of ballistic missiles. Trump wants to eliminate any future potential for an Iranian nuclear facility that he said was “obliterated” during strikes in June, but that could still be revived.

The biggest unknown looming over the talks is how much patience the president has for negotiating before turning to strikes. Trump said on Tuesday that the U.S. will “have to do something very tough” if a deal is not reached soon.

Trump’s latest threats against Iran began last month, near the height of protests inside the country, when it appeared that the regime could fall and U.S. military strikes could finish it off. Since then, the Iranian government has cracked down on protesters, killing thousands and arresting political figures who have promoted reforms. The country is the weakest it has been in decades: Its economy is in a downward spiral, and its proxies, particularly in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, are stretched thin, making asserting power across the region more difficult.

But just because a regime is fragile politically doesn’t mean it is weak militarily. A strike against Iran would be a daunting, complex operation for the U.S. military, defense officials told us. The brutality with which the Iranian government quashed protests suggests that it is not in immediate danger of falling, and the nation’s security apparatus (notably its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) did not defect or fracture during the uprisings. The country has long-range ballistic missiles that can reach every corner of the Middle East and hundreds of cruise missiles and drones that could easily strike countries in the Gulf. These assets remain functional after the U.S. bombed the Fordow nuclear site and Israel damaged air defenses over the summer.

Read: What are the chances Trump attacks Iran?

An operation aimed at regime change or the weakening of Iran’s nuclear program would be “highly complex because of Iran’s capabilities,” one official told us. Iran would respond, the official said, potentially striking U.S. forces and allies.

The operation would also be difficult to sustain. The “Armada” that Trump said is moving with “great power, enthusiasm, and purpose” is insufficient to mount a major weekslong offensive, the officials told us, and does not include the needed air defenses. The United States has enough military assets in the region to conduct a narrow mission over several days—one that could, for instance, involve targeted strikes on key Iranian leaders or military assets. The Pentagon referred questions about the need for more military firepower in the region to the White House. The White House reiterated Trump’s view that the Iranian regime must abandon its nuclear program and “make a deal.”

The U.S. strikes against Iran over the summer—a more limited operation than what Trump is now signaling—originated from two aircraft carriers in the region. A larger offensive would require at least two carriers that could bring in enough planes to, for example, strike many of Iran’s ballistic-missile launchers. (Only one carrier strike group, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is currently in the region.) On Tuesday, Trump told Axios that he was considering deploying a second carrier. Doing so would require one of the Navy’s existing carrier crews to cut their preparation or rest time. Getting the carrier there—the USS George H. W. Bush is next in line—would take at least two weeks.

If Iran’s ultimate goal is to preserve its regime, compromises on its nuclear program and regional proxies will be needed, defense officials told us. Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more than two hours yesterday. Netanyahu has been clear that he worries that any negotiation will give Iran too much leeway. “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated,” Trump posted on Truth Social after the meeting with Netanyahu.

Israel would likely support the U.S. in targeting Iran, officials told us, but the rest of the region is eager to avoid hostilities. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—neither of which is at all sympathetic to Iran—told administration officials that they do not want to be involved in and would not support a regional conflict, according to Arab and U.S. officials. Countries hosting U.S. military bases—specifically Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain—are particularly vulnerable because Iran has warned that it could retaliate against those bases. Any military action could shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a transit point for roughly 20 percent of the world’s oil exports. Some countries fear that military action could rattle investors’ confidence in a region that relies heavily on direct foreign investment. Gulf allies also fear catastrophic outcomes, such as radiation exposure resulting from strikes on nuclear facilities or cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Iran’s opposition, meanwhile, is disorganized and has little common vision for the country’s future beyond a desire to get rid of the clerics.

Without regional support, the United States risks entering into a war without a coalition that would reinforce its military might. But there’s also a risk in continuing to delay. Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told us that by putting military action on the table and then not seeing it through, “Trump has instead alerted Iran of potential war and given them time to prepare.” Every day that U.S. forces are in the region without acting, they give Iran more of a chance to get ready.</div>

I have to ask something, because it&#39;s relevant.

When you say it&#39;s a &quot;shitty dotcom era remake&quot;, what level of informed statement is that? How recently have you used the frontier models from OpenAI or Anthropic?  Are you genuinely informed here, or making an assessment off using Cursor for a couple hours 4 months ago? Because that&#39;s not even close to representative of where things are today.

Just this week and last, I&#39;ve used the frontier models to fully audit an existing code base and make both architectural

IPO already? Sounds like they&#39;re running out of smart money and moving onto the dumb.

Unless they&#39;ve managed to improve things internally much faster than it&#39;s perceived. They&#39;re moving extremely fast.

There&#39;s a lot of talk that the Opus 4.6 is really just Sonnet 5 (and behavioral characteristics lend no small amount of credibility to this claim) with much higher margins + intentional token slowdown, which could in theory mean they&#39;re now making money per token instead of losing it.

Last week I praised Claude code, especially the cli here on slashdot. I still think it&#39;s currently the best but it&#39;s also the most expensive.  But the competition is getting a lot better (and cheaper).  I&#39;ve been using the opencode cli lately with several models:  Kimi K2.5, Kimi K2.5 Thinking, OpenCode&#39;s Big Pickle, and Qwen3 Coder Next.  Using them through OpenCode&#39;s Zen service and also OpenRouter (for Qwen3 Coder Next), they are all about 1/2 the cost of Claude&#39;s models, maybe less.

Of those I feel that Kimi K2.5 Thinking is probably the closest to Claude Opus 4.6.  The rest are quite good at most things, and Qwen3 Coder Next is very fast.  Qwen3 Coder Next also has the potential to run on &quot;reasonable&quot; local hardware.

I think in the next year we&#39;ll see some of the open source models catch up with and surpass the closed models in a real way. Even if they get to Opus 4.5/4.6 parity (I personally think 4.5 is markedly more predictable in its behavior and makes a better &quot;daily driver&quot; than 4.6), that&#39;s still more than good enough to daily drive for almost all tasks. Tools like opencode make agent-specific models not only tenable but practical, to boot.

This is still fairly early stage. You&#39;ve got to run things at scale and se

Pedo protecting Trump officials laugh at you pitiful example of reach.

The fact Trump hasn&#39;t fired Pam Bondi after her disastrous display. Shows she was doing exactly what he wanted.
pedo protecting goes right to the top.

Yes, nice. But then you read &quot;Attributing sophisticated hacks is notoriously difficult and debates over how best to assign blame for digital intrusions are common among cybersecurity researchers.&quot; and with a grain of salt in your head you should be able to question &quot;how, then, did you figure out it was the chinese?&quot;.

If PA is willing to engage in deception and coverups in order to simp and cover for authoritarians... and obviously they are, because they did... then they can simply never be trusted in a security context again.  And since security is basically their entire thing; anyone who uses them or continues to use them, moving forward, is a catastrophic fool.

And all the unconstitutional surveillance of own citizens that goes on is ok? Heh ok ok

For what it&#39;s worth, I do see Teams asking for OS location, camera, and mic permissions, but not other Office programs.

Not sure, I can only speak from corporate experience. It may be installed by default, but it asks for permissions on first run.

Why do Excel/Word/Outlook need access to your location/camera/mic? Are you sure they&#39;re not asking for permission because they aren&#39;t using them?

Nope, I would rather have an OS for a PC, not a smart phone. You&#39;ve lost your way Microslop.

I wish desktop apps could work more like Android apps. Sure, some of them need to hook into the system a bit deeper, but a lot could be fully sandboxed. No need to install into the real filesystem, all files kept cleanly in one place and removed when the app is uninstalled. No permissions at all without explicit confirmation from the user.

You can do it with the tech Windows has already, but it&#39;s a pain.

To me the critical feature this is missing in access control like, know location, access a calendar etc, Is no but lie, most people just grant access because they want run the app they will say yes to anything. Just think of license agreements.

Like all the other things Microsoft recently tried to implement; it&#39;ll be implemented badly and will eventually be rolled back because it&#39;s broken state.

This sounds nice, and macOS is pretty good at this, but I do wonder if there are ways to get around this.  For example, accessing a photos repository via the filesystem and not a photos API, or accessing contact files directly as opposed to a contact API.  Even with these permissions fairly tight, if the app can scoot around add/modify stuff, it can do ransomware, Trojans, or data exfiltration.

What many developers will do is just not bother with code signing and demand the user do some overrides, or do something similar to Macs, and force allowing &quot;full disk access&quot; for the program to run.  Maybe even force the user to turn off the prompts, just like in the Vista days where users were told to turn off UAC.

Bring it back Microsoft, that was super intuitive. Since this is the AI era, have Bob and Clippy ask it.

And be sure to ask &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before looping back to Abort, Retry, Fail?_.

Ok, your us of a definitely sucks eggs. How can &quot;white house&quot; tell FAA what to do? That NTSB lady should shut it down now, noone can tell her what to do from what I&#39;ve seen. If she can that is...

*has terrifying flashbacks to the recentish Celestial Toymaker episode.

That will be the workaround, send 100 balloons and one drone with drugs... while everyone is looking high to the balloons, send the drone low and no one will notice! :D

Or send the drone attached to the balloon, only after it pops (ie: taken down), it will be activated after a few seconds and fly away

Yet just a few years ago, we had a MASSIVE huge balloon, a spy balloon from China slowly wend it&#39;s way across the whole US over military bases and other sensitive sites on the ground.....and didn&#39;t take any action till it had essentially completed it&#39;s mission and they shot it down with a missile over the ocean off the east coast I believe....

Is there not a happy medium for dealing with UFOs?

well, at least one of those was actually really a weather balloon... but panic is always the best choice for many officials

Military tends to be better trained than law enforcement and my gut tells me if you deployed these to 100 commands and put them in a dozen hands at each one.  You&#39;d be due for an incident somewhere in 4 years.

Training people so they can hand over a firearm without negligent discharge is impossible.  Why?  I dunno but every year people shoot themselves or someone else despite X and Y number of certification and training hours and even deployment of tooling like clearing barrels.

I get it, but, really?

Laser operators are going to mistake a 737 for a cartel drone?These are CBP laser operators. You know, the agency responsible for the current crop of ICE agents who couldn&#39;t catch a clue if you carefully placed it in their hands.I seriously would not discount the likelihood - never mind the mere possibility - of one of those yahoos mistaking a jumbo jet for a drone.

Happened in the Iraq war.An idiot at a Patriot trigger shot down two Tornadoes in landing approach. Aka: slow, flaps out, gear down ...4  pilots dead.And a Tornado is pretty unique aircraft, despite the fact that Iraq at that time supposedly had no fighters left.

Correction:  &quot;Mistaking a Panavia Tornado with literally ANYTHING in Iraq&#39;s inventory.&quot;  Just look at the Tornado and compare & contrast with the MiGs and Mirages Iraq operated at the time.  To get those mixed up with a Tornado, you&#39;d have to be blind, an idiot, or a blind idiot.

What about the Russians doing that [wikipedia.org] although they used a missile rather than a laser?  It was 13-14 months ago.

Laser operators are going to mistake a 737 for a cartel drone?The same laser operators who supposedly mistook a balloon for a cartel drone?  Yes, plausibly. 
That&#39;d be the only part of this whole story that is plausible though.

They mistook a party balloon for a drone, so why not?

Then there&#39;s simply missing the target and hitting whatever might be behind it. Lasers go a long way.

MH17. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

I was on the same flight a few weeks earlier.

Fucking ruzzkie murderers from a regular anti-aircraft unit.

Well... certain pinheads at the FAA are so paranoid about their mental association of the word &quot;laser&quot; with sci-fi ray guns that they think any Joe Schmoe can bring down a Boeing or Airbus with a $5 cat toy he got from Petco.  So, an actual military laser that really could legitimately damage an aircraft?  I&#39;m actually not surprised at all that they completely flipped their shit.

Now, the &quot;left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing&quot; aspect of the event is certainly troubling.  But the absurd overreac

Not to call you stupid, but you are stupid if you point any laser to a plane, specially at night!! During the day, there isn&#39;t much issue but during the night can be very dangerous.Even weak lasers can travel far, and during the night, our eyes open more to receive more light and see. The fact that a weak can reach the plane and light it enough to cause temporary blindness to pilots, that guess, need their eyes to read all the info and control the plane.

If the plane is high enough, usually isn&#39;t much a issu

I mean, I would rather have the military check their damned target before firing a military-grade laser.

If the border patrol can&#39;t tell the difference between a drone and a balloon then it&#39;s probably a wise move to make sure there are no planes around where they&#39;re playing with their pew pew lasers.

Lasers are famous for doing things you don&#39;t expect. Reflecting off a shiny mylar balloon and blinding pilots for example.

Apparently drones flown by drug cartels actually are an increasing problem at the border.  I&#39;m not clear if they are just surveilling border patrol positions or actually carrying drugs.

This outrageous level of paranoia over &quot;alleged&quot; drone sightings will cost human lives soon.

Here we have the US military mis-identifying a party balloon as a drone and firing a powerful laser at it -- while members of the public get prosecuted every year for flicking their laser-pointers at helicopters and airliners.

In Germany,  police will be allowed to shoot at &quot;alleged&quot; drones [theguardian.com] even though it has been clearly proven that most (if not all) of the recent drone sightings were simply mis-identified aircraft lights.

Can anyone see the potential for disaster here?

The mis-identification of aircraft flying at night as &quot;drones&quot; has become rife, dating back beyond the NY/NJ &quot;drone&quot; incidents that caused such concern in the USA a year or two ago.    Almost without exception, these &quot;drones&quot; are real aircraft (often passenger flights) carrying people through the skies.  How long before one of them is shot down by paranoid trigger-happy idiots?

Paranoia is a mental health issue and it&#39;s infecting governments and authorities around the world.

Before someone says &quot;but... Ukraine...&quot;  I ask you:  how many people have died as the result of actions by bad actors using drones in the USA or outside the war zones in Europe?

Yes, it &quot;could&quot; happen but right now it&#39;s far more likely that innocent people will die from friendly fire produced by paranoid idiots on the ground with guns and lasers.

For two or three weeks during that time, I saw many aircraft in my area that were unlike any others I had ever seen (and I spent most of my life living under the approach route of an international airport).  Th

Yeah. Sure. It wasn&#39;t that you were misidentifying large, loud, distant aircraft as small, quiet, low flying aircraft. Sure. Absolutely. You wouldn&#39;t make such a mistake. Not like all those other people we know are making these same misidentifications. You are the gold standard for reporting drone aircraft. If only we could send you to Ukraine to identify enemy drones...

If only we could send you to Ukraine to identify enemy drones...In non-Soviet Ukraine, enemy drones identify you!

If only we could send you to Ukraine to identify enemy drones...

In non-Soviet Ukraine, enemy drones identify you!

You are absolutely right, and the likely response by said officials will be &quot;oops, have a scandal to divert your attention&quot;.

And Ukraine is only a problem area because those same officials don&#39;t take anything seriously unless it impacts their promotion prospects.

Remind me again... What language do they speak in Mexico and why?

They speak Spanish and recognize over 68 indigenous languages from the displaced tribes they conquered.

... only very competent white MAGA men ...

Your tax dollars at work, ladies and gentlemen.

Blame it on a boogeyman but, &quot;it was just here, it&#39;s gone now.&quot; They would should print it on shirts to save some time. Just point and move on to deflection.

... will have cameras and telemetry on it that feed back to TEH CARTELS.

Oh, and it will have fentanyl er I mean candy inside so when it pops everyone gets a treat.

Seriously, if I were the cartels reading this I&#39;d be exploring how to &quot;flood the zone&quot; with party balloons and put cameras on a few of them.

Yeah, that &quot;drug cartel drone invasion&quot; never happened.

When a leader&#39;s #1 job requirement is being a sycophant and there is no #2.

This is just a continuation of the crap we keep seeing because the cabinet was populated with toadies and Congress is led by cowards. Trump chose an incompetent person to head DHS; who then installs incompetent (or even evil) people to head CPB, ICE, etc.; who then inevitably keep making bad decisions that the population has to live with (or die with, as we&#39;ve also seen).

The good news is, because of this it&#39;ll probably go very badly for Trump at the midterms.

The bad news is, the ongoing damage will take years-to-decades to repair - assuming it can be repaired at all.

The good news is, because of this it&#39;ll probably go very badly for Trump at the midterms.

He&#39;s already laying the groundwork to invalidate or take over control of the midterms to ensure that your vote only counts if it&#39;s for his toadies.

Somebody: Hey, FAA, the DOD gave ICE anti-air weapons and they&#39;re shooting at something in El Paso!

FAA: Shit. Close the airspace now! We don&#39;t need our own Malaysia flight 17, Ukraine flight 752 or Azerbaijan flight 8243!

FAA: Jesus. You&#39;ve got to warn us when you do this stuff. At least everyone&#39;s safe. What was it?

Suzie Wiles: Idiots. You can&#39;t say that. Let&#39;s go with &quot;terrorist cartel drug drone.&quot;

A couple of other examples:- Iran shot an Air Ukraine flight down (this was before the Russians invaded Ukraine) because they thought it was Israeli, and they had reason to expect an air strike from that direction.- Russia shot an Azerbajani passenger flight down because they were expecting Ukrainian drones (I can&#39;t remember whether they were already under attack from that direction).

That someone needs to be held accountable.I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;ve seen out of this administration that would indicate holding people accountable for their actions was on the table.  I mean, if you said something mean about Trump or his goon squad that&#39;s going to garner some attention, but that&#39;s really the end of the list.

Any &quot;AI&quot; (it&#39;s just a broken LUT) that currently exists is based on stale, incorrect, and old data, with too much entropy to be reliable. I wish I could use it, but instead I have to develop my own to reach both determinism and economical scalability.

Probably get better results than when they just assign someone to you.

I swear there used to be these places, you go there and learn how to code, you pay a bunch of money and get a piece of paper, and in the end, a coder with that piece of paper would get paid more than someone without the piece of paper... can&#39;t remember what those places were called.

It&#39;s a foot in the door, and it&#39;s evidence of a solid basis should they prove via the interview to have the necessary domain knowledge (so maybe more starting salary), but one should still have the opportunity to interview anyone that will be their direct report (just my 2 cents... I&#39;ve been assigned employees before and have not had the best experience with it).

I&#39;m a hardware guy with limited programming experience. I can read and understand C for the most part but when it comes to coding, I am not a neckbeard. Claude Code has enabled me to finish a veritable shit-ton of projects that I have designed and built hardware for but been unable to get the firmware/software side working. And, that&#39;s just at home.

At work, I&#39;m an engineering manager and I&#39;ve been able streamline our design and coding processes immensely by training my engineers on using Claude code to do some heavy lifting for them. The result is that my green engineers fresh out of school are productive much faster, and more importantly, I can reduce org costs by having a lower headcount. By the end of this year I expect I&#39;ll be able to reduce headcount by 25% in the engineering department, mostly in the senior staff as they are a) resistant to adoption of AI and b) expensive as hell for people who don&#39;t want to grow in their roles and use new tools.

AI is the way of the future, whether we like it or not. The best course is to adopt it and let it make you better at your job, as it has for me. Those who refuse are going to whine and bitch and moan themselves into irrelevance by the end of this year.

AI works well today. Is it perfect? No, but I haven&#39;t seen any 1.0 code that hasn&#39;t had bug fix releases when coded &quot;the old way&quot; without AI.

1. Reduce senior staff2. Realise code needs to be maintained3. Realise nobody knows how the AI code works4. Realise the AI can&#39;t maintain its own code5. Get the AI to start again with new code6.

&quot;Kiro runs on Anthropic&#39;s Claude models but uses Amazon&#39;s own tooling&quot;

The models require a front end that feeds them user queries, gives r/w access to local files, etc. and most people will want it to work from within the IDE they normally use. For millions of developers that IDE is Visual Studio Code. There are several companies out there that have forked VS Code to make a custom version that integrates with multiple LLM models. Amazon Kiro is one of them, so for many people this will integrate right in with their work flow; https://kiro.dev/ [kiro.dev]

You can choose from multiple Anthropic models with Kiro but not other brands such as Gemini, GPT, which means less flexibility for the developer. I will say that in my opinion the Claude models are the top performers.https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/chat... [kiro.dev]

Here is someone&#39;s comparison of Claude Code and Windsurf; https://aiforcode.io/tools/cla... [aiforcode.io]

So I&#39;m not sure what the big fuss is about. Claude Code is &quot;Terminal-native CLI via npm. Native VS Code and JetBrains IDE extensions.&quot; Possibly it gives you a larger context window than some other options? Other than that it appears to be much the same.

The power of claude code isn&#39;t in the tool, as much as it is the ecosystem of plugins and the ability to customize it for your specific workflow, and it&#39;s AI-native.

It isn&#39;t some sloppy bolt on that thinks people will be writing the actual code. (They won&#39;t.)

The release of the Epstein files—the slow-drip revelations of a web of privileged (mostly) men trading gifts, access, favors, and sickening child predation as casually as Pokémon cards—has been deliberately parsed out through 2026 as to both be buried itself and bury other horrific news coming out of the Trump administration. But this misses a critical point: The Epstein file dump is not simply playing out as a backdrop against which other acts of American lawlessness are occurring. The Epstein story is also the template and the proof text for all that is happening in Minnesota; at dangerous detention centers; in efforts to punish members of Congress for lawful speech; for crypto scams; and for measles outbreaks. It is an ongoing road map for an administration that lives out the reality that they are rich and powerful and famous enough to be above the law each day, and wishes for the rest of us to ultimately learn and accept that fact.

So it follows that Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying blithely before a congressional hearing on Wednesday, as Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors sat behind her, unacknowledged and irrelevant to her purposes, is the template for that messaging: Blond woman who knows she must seek and maintain protection from this administration’s simulacrum of justice crows about the Dow Jones for the cameras, because she understands that if she doesn’t, she will be left behind, asking to be respected, like the masses of women behind her.

And it is equally true that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bring his children and their nannies to a bespoke lunch on Epstein’s island in 2012, long after he allegedly broke off contact with the sex predator, precisely because Lutnick’s children and their nannies were not the types of children or women who would be abandoned there to be raped and threatened. He is also a walking infomercial about whom the law protects and whom it leaves broken and invisible, behind. Lutnick’s testimony this past week, like Bondi’s, is thus operating as a still life in what happens when the law becomes inert. On the one hand, it is not relevant as a restraint to those who need not rely on it; on the other, it is not protective for those who do.

Liz Plank, on her Substack, describes the nausea and disorientation felt by women realizing this past week that we had all been gaslit yet again. Those of us who cannot even begin to imagine a permission structure that allowed and encouraged passing young girls around, trading insults and articles about them (“your littlest girl was a little naughty”), and bonding over the hysteria of #MeToo can barely comprehend why it was that this class of men always took the gift and the freebie and the shitty watch and the plane trip, because access to yet more of the same somehow became the coin of the realm. What Plank describes as “trust bias”—the psychological tendency to assume that others are operating within the same moral and ethical universe as yourself—means that we are all, once again, annihilated by the fact that America’s shared moral universe is a collective fiction, one that constrains one class of people and merely titillates another.

We err when we call what is being done by ICE officials to citizens and noncitizens on the streets of American cities “law,” just as we err when we call what has thus far been afforded the Epstein survivors “justice.” Indeed, the word law is too generous to contain the plea deals and the willing ignorance and the prison transfers that were granted to Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators at every turn. And the word injustice is far too small to describe the spectacle of hundreds of survivors who have still not been given a reckoning or a measure of genuine accountability, whose unredacted names appeared in public documents and who had never been contacted by the Department of Justice.

Pam Bondi may be in charge of many officials and many investigations and many legal things at the DOJ, but what she is protecting is neither justice nor law. And that means that what Plank describes as a trust bias is also an exquisitely American “law bias,” and we should dispense with the notion that we are all in some group compact to protect and preserve the same things. The law is neither protecting the vulnerable nor constraining the Epstein class. And perhaps we should stop referencing that word to mean either project, much less deploying it to describe both.

What Bondi, and Donald Trump, and Lutnick, and Todd Blanche are doing under the banner of law and law enforcement and pardons and immunity and impunity is an operatic performance of a single truth: The “law” will now protect those who are within the network of favors and privilege and secrets and side-eyes and snickers and abuse of young girls, and the “law” will also abandon those who are not. What Bondi did this week under the bright lights of the U.S. Congress was to personify that the law is a word for the thing that is “weaponized” when it’s used against the president, and is the thing that is bestowed benignly on those who seek his grace. This is a protection racket, and we are being conditioned in plain sight to recognize that it protects itself and it preys on everyone who refuses to buckle.

This isn’t to say that the law is meaningless. Judges across the country prove every day that the law is still the last, best guardrail against that sort of nihilist thinking. But the attorney general’s performance was an hourslong spectacle enacted solely to highlight who lives above the law and who must beg it for scraps. We should probably stop calling this law and call it simply “power.” Just as we could stop calling Bondi the AG and call her Trump’s constitutional Roomba. We should almost certainly stop calling the Epstein survivors anything other than the legal heroes and dreamers they are.

On Wednesday, I went for a walk outside around a lake near my home. I didn’t wear a mask. I could see, clearly, the buildings on the other side. I came home feeling happy and invigorated.

This doesn’t sound like much, but I live in Hanoi, Vietnam, a city that frequently ranks as one of the world’s most polluted. It is an incredible place to live: culturally vibrant, wonderfully optimistic, with notoriously excellent food. But when it’s “pollution season”—roughly October to March—too much time outdoors and without a mask means headaches, an itchy throat, and sore lungs, not to mention an elevated risk of everything from asthma to dementia to various cancers. On Wednesday, we had a rare afternoon where the Air Quality Index was below 100. The air quality on my app was yellow, or moderate—not even the elusive green, which signals good air—but in a Hanoi winter, yellow is a gift.

By the time I went on my only-moderately-polluted walk, I had already been assigned to write a column about the Trump administration’s obliteration of efforts to fight climate change. I was mulling how incredible it is that Americans live in a wealthy, developed, incredibly prosperous nation; that we generally enjoy clean water, clean land, and clean air, and even clean air in our largest cities; that we enjoy that level of cleanliness in large part thanks to the environmental movement and the many rules and regulations environmentally conscious politicians have put into place; and that there are right-wing American activists who have dedicated their careers to undoing all of it—and there’s a large contingent of American voters who support them.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, run by climate change denialists and people who seem oddly hostile to the environment they are in charge of protecting, is revoking the “endangerment finding,” a ruling that underpins much of the government’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The endangerment finding operates under the Clean Air Act, and to be clear, that law has not yet been revoked (although they would if they could). But overturning the endangerment finding undermines the law’s ability to do anything about climate change—and it’s hard to overstate just how devastating this deregulation will be for the planet. Scientists are unified in the understanding that pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane are warming the earth, which in turn drives natural disasters, drought, disease, flooding, and even war.

The fight isn’t over. Environmental and public health groups will immediately sue to protect the (glaringly obvious) finding that the propellants of catastrophic climate change do indeed present a risk to public health. But the administration is ready to take their case to a very deregulation-friendly and Trump-favoring Supreme Court. They’re seeking a quick result so that they can take a sledgehammer not just to environmental regulations, but to the federal government’s very ability to impose environmental regulations—making it harder, if not impossible, for future Democratic presidents to take decisive action on the environment. “They want to not just do what other Republican administrations have done, which is weaken regulations,” Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program head Jody Freeman told the New York Times. “They want to take the federal government out of the business of regulation, period.”

This is par for the course from an administration that is hostile not just to efforts to fight climate change, but to the kind of green energy that will power the future—and that is already powering the present in much of the world. Renewables are overtaking coal and gas, and the market for green energy is exploding. There are enormous economic opportunities here, ones that President Joe Biden put America on the path to enjoying; before Trump took office, many people, especially in red states, were already cashing in. Trump has walked back many of these gains, squandering billions of dollars.

You might have read about the dystopia of super-polluted cities like Delhi, where the city always seems to be shrouded in dust, and you don’t see the sun for days. But here, I think the evenings are the strangest. The streetlights illuminate what looks like fog, and you can see little particles of dust and debris swirling around. I always think: Oh, that’s going directly into my lungs.

My days are set by my AQI app. I prefer to work in my favorite café down the street—Hanoi has famously exceptional coffee culture—but it doesn’t run air purifiers, and so if the AQI is dangerously high, I stay home. On the few times I have risked it, I’ve come home nauseous, and with a pounding headache, itchy red eyes, and lungs that feel inflamed and like they won’t quite fill up all the way. The app I use has a little cartoon person to illustrate each level of danger. On green days, he smiles. On yellow (moderate) days, he’s neutral; orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) days, he frowns; red (unhealthy) he wears a mask; purple (very unhealthy) he dons a respirator; and when it’s maroon (hazardous), he has on an even more serious respirator and looks extremely alarmed—this means the AQI is over 300, “a health warning of emergency conditions,” which means that “the entire population is likely to be severely affected,” according to the IQAir app. (I keep New York on my AQI app too: It’s almost always green.)

People in Hanoi aren’t living like this for fun. Vietnam is something of an economic miracle, with a stunning rate of economic growth. It has rapidly industrialized, which has lifted tens of millions of people out of poverty. Those people then buy motorbikes, build houses, and work in newly constructed factories (go ahead and check how many of your most recent Amazon orders, whatever they were, were made in Vietnam). Pollution from the traffic, factories, and construction is all severe; the benefits of all of these things are also extraordinary in a country that was ravaged by war just a few decades ago. There are certainly ways for countries to develop sustainably; it seems questionable whether there are ways for countries to rapidly industrialize and develop at a cheetah’s pace and not seriously degrade the environment in the process. Here, though, the calculus is complex. Yes, the air pollution is horrible, and kills some 60,000 people every year. But in the early 1990s, close to four in five Vietnamese households were living in extreme poverty. Now, extreme poverty is inching toward zero. That is even more life-saving.

And while it’s far from perfect, the government here is in fact trying to implement environmental regulations to protect the country’s diverse ecology, clean up the air, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Americans are not living under a similar calculus. We don’t have to choose between economic prosperity and a livable country (not to mention a livable planet). We can move toward even greater prosperity by investing in future-forward clean energy sources. We can be good stewards of a spectacular country, with its plains and canyons and mountains and deserts, as well as its vibrant cities.

At this moment, however, we’re simply choosing not to. Trump has said he supports clean air but not efforts to address climate change, but the two are inextricable. The move from fossil fuels to green energy is not only a must for greenhouse gas reduction, it’s a huge part of reducing the kind of conventional pollutants that continue to degrade our air quality—and our lungs.

A small handful of people are making a whole lot of money in sticking with the old dirty energy sources. This administration has intentionally set back progress on wind and solar projects, as well as on the electric vehicles that much of the world is transitioning over to, in order to prop up a few wealthy tycoons at the expense of the rest of us. And of course the burdens are not felt equally. This is certainly true where I live: I have the resources to buy good air purifiers, a job that lets me work from home, the money to take a taxi rather than a motorbike if I want to get somewhere, and the knowledge of the dangers and how to mitigate them (for example: burning through half a dozen rolls of winterizing tape to seal every door and window so less of the bad air can get in). That’s not the case for huge swaths of the population here, and certainly not for the people whose entire livelihoods revolve around dealing with the trash and pollutants that are the cost of development. In the U.S., low-income residents, as well as Black, Latino, and Asian Americans, are disproportionately exposed to much higher levels of air pollution than white and wealthier Americans, which contributes to illness and premature death. Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” is notorious for industrial pollution that lays waste to the human population—and the people who live closest to the industrial plants tend to be Black and poor.

Even with this decimation of environmental regulations, America’s largest cities are unlikely to regularly find themselves on the most-polluted lists. But the air pollution you can see is far from the only risk to your health, your community, other human beings, and the future of life on our planet. As someone who checks the AQI like it’s the weather, I am genuinely, profoundly flummoxed by those who invite in environmental degradation and the destruction of what makes so much of this world so beautiful—and who, in the name of politics or profit, are so willing to burn the future.

With great fanfare last summer, House and Senate Republicans approved $45 billion to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention capacity as part of their signature catchall bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This exorbitant amount—one of many line items in the bill’s historic ramp-up of immigration enforcement funding—was considered an easy part of the bill to pass. Republicans didn’t fight over it. Democrats, still angsty after the 2024 election about looking soft on immigration, didn’t call much attention to it.

But now that this network of massive detention centers—large-scale holding centers for people awaiting deportation—is being constructed, the reaction from Republicans is: Not in my backyard.

From Maryland and Virginia to Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Arizona, and everywhere in between, massive warehouses that the Department of Homeland Security is purchasing to convert into detention centers are being met with fierce resistance. It should go without saying that Democratic officials, who’ve recently rediscovered their courage in opposing Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement plans, don’t want 1,500-to-10,000-bed cogs in Trump’s deportation machine within their jurisdictions—or anyone else’s. But it’s the pushback from national Republican electeds, who voted enthusiastically to construct this apparatus just last summer, that’s especially notable. They’re not protesting on behalf of the detainees, or rejecting the administration’s vision. All are quick to point out that they adore the goals of this project. But if you try to place a piece of this infrastructure in their communities, well, someone in the administration is going to get an earful.

The words of Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker rejecting an ICE detention center in his state‍—‍“While I support the enforcement of immigration law, I write to express my opposition to this acquisition and the proposed detention center”—are beginning to read like a form letter.

The administration is doing more than just buying up some vacant space here or there. It’s creating a new model for processing, holding, and deporting people in its custody. In this hub-and-spoke system, “smaller” (still enormous) warehouses would be used as roughly 1,500-bed processing sites that feed into larger, 5,000-to-10,000-bed detention centers, from which deportations would be staged. This would achieve the administration’s goals of deporting immigrants more efficiently and at greater scale. If this sounds like an Amazon distribution system, that’s by design. In the immortal 2025 words of Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, the deportation machine should be like “Prime, but with human beings.”

Ever since proposed locations for these warehouse purchases were published a couple of months ago, and coinciding with the sharp decline in ICE’s public image following a pair of killings in Minnesota, local pushback has been strong. Municipal meetings overflow with complaints, and local officials do what they can to push back. On the same January day ICE was spotted touring a building in Kansas City for a detention center, for example, the city council passed a resolution banning nonmunicipal detention centers for five years, though the fight goes on. A Canadian developer who owned a warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, that DHS was looking to purchase took the property off the market following public outcry. The owners of another warehouse in Oklahoma City, similarly, cut off talks with DHS. The Oklahoma City mayor, in a Facebook post, wrote that “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City.”

That mayor is a Republican. A lot of these local officials at the 23 sites DHS is eyeing are Republicans. Their concerns don’t necessarily touch on the humanity of what ICE is doing, or present a conscientious case against the erection of a mass prison network. Instead, the arguments are more about disruptions to communities that aren’t situated to handle this—and weren’t given opportunities to explain this before DHS proceeded. And those complaints from local Republicans have fed up to their Republican national officials.

In his Feb. 4 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Wicker laid out his case against a proposed ICE detention center in Byhalia, Mississippi. It covers most of the points that other Republicans, in similar situations, have been making.

Wicker argued that the location was “positioned for economic development purposes” and that “converting this industrial asset into an ICE detention center forecloses economic growth opportunities and replaces them with a use that does not generate comparable economic returns or community benefits.” Further, mass detention facilities put strains on local resources (“transportation access, water, sewer and energy costs, staffing, medical care, and emergency services”), as human beings have needs that Amazon Prime packages do not. Last, Wicker pointed to “public safety” concerns from the community. Understandably so, given that the Trump administration has sold its enforcement regime as necessary because undocumented immigrants are hardened killers from mental institutions.

“I look forward to your prompt response,” Wicker concluded, and then pointedly reminded her to “keep me informed of this acquisition and any future ICE contracting proposals affecting the state of Mississippi.” Wicker noted shortly thereafter that Noem told him she would search for a new location.

Not everyone has been so lucky. DHS has made successful acquisitions despite similar concerns elsewhere. DHS closed on a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona, late last month, paying $70 million in cash, much to the, well, surprise of the local government. This earned a rebuke not just from Democratic senators or state leaders, but from Rep. Paul Gosar, a far-right member of Congress who was vehemently anti-immigration before it was cool. In a Feb. 4 letter to Noem, Gosar—after a few paragraphs of throat-clearing about his strong support for ICE—asked 15 questions about how the hell Surprise, Arizona, is expected to absorb this, and why the city wasn’t consulted about it at all.

The small town of Social Circle, Georgia, with a population of about 5,000 people, also recently learned that it, against its wishes, would be getting an ICE detention facility that could double or triple its population in a matter of months. (It’s not hard to find the specific warehouses. Do a map search of the town name, and it’s usually the biggest rectangular structure.) The retrofitted warehouse could begin receiving detainees by April. This prompted Social Circle’s congressman, Mike Collins, a MAGA social media gadfly who’s now running for Senate, to pipe up.

“Although I am aligned with the mission of ICE to detain and deport the criminal illegal aliens who have flooded across our border due to Joe Biden’s reckless policies,” Collins wrote on Facebook earlier this month, “I agree with the community that Social Circle does not have the sufficient resources that this facility would require.”

These are just a few examples. There’s bipartisan opposition to a proposed processing facility in Chester, New York. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who didn’t vote for the OBBBA but is certainly Democrats’ most pro-immigration-enforcement senator, wrote his own letter of complaint to Noem about two facilities reportedly under consideration for Pennsylvania. The offices of Texas’ two Republican senators didn’t respond with their positions regarding three facilities reportedly eyed for their state—though Sen. John Cornyn’s office passed along floor remarks noting his support for funding DHS and ICE—and neither did the offices of Missouri’s two Republican senators regarding the proposed Kansas City megawarehouse.

DHS, too, did not respond for comment about the pushback, and whether it had adequately discussed its purchase plans with stakeholders.

The lack of consultation across the map, though, doesn’t look like an oversight. This is how White House policy chief Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation agenda, runs his government: Act fast because time is ticking, and deal with—or steamroll past—individual complaints after the fact. It does not take a genius to understand that members or senators might vote for one thing and then complain when it threatens to overwhelm their local sewer systems, or places detention camps within a mile of elementary schools. “Mass deportation” as a slogan to rev up the base was one thing; in practice, every step of the process‍—‍from the mass deployments of agents to the construction of detention—burns enthusiasm for the project. The administration is doing what it can, as quickly as it can, before the luster is gone altogether.

Last week, two Democrats in the Senate hosted a “bicameral public forum to receive testimony on the violent tactics and disproportionate use of force by agents of the Department of Homeland Security.” Here in Minnesota, we continue to deal with the thousands of immigration enforcement agents who have unleashed unspeakable violence on our state. Flights leave daily with men, women, and children, some of whom are citizens, green-card holders, or asylum-seekers with pending cases, to detention centers with a prevailing culture of abuse. Countless other legal observers and protesters, including myself, have been handcuffed and detained for hours without being charged with a crime, or intimidated with weapons and threats.

In the spirit of the public forum held in the District of Columbia last week, I collected the following set of comments ICE agents have made to my community, pulled from video recordings, sworn affidavits, and media reports. (A sourced list of these interactions is being compiled here.) We may not know their names or see their faces, but we hear what they say.

Agent standing in front of a truck and aiming a gun at Adan Nunez Gonzalez, while other agents rip Gonzalez out of his vehicle. Gonzalez was an asylum-seeker with no criminal record but was deported to Mexico. Nov. 11.

Agent standing in front of a car with an assault rifle pointed at the driver. Dec. 7.

After moving in front of Renee Good’s car, then shooting her three times. Jan 7.

Responding to a civilian shouting “I’m a physician!” The physician was desperate to try to check Good’s pulse and offer help but was told to stay back. Emergency services arrived later but were unable to save her life. Jan. 7.

To a Somali citizen told to prove his citizenship. Jan. 7.

To a pastor released after a warrantless detainment. He had been detained because he said he wasn’t afraid of them. An agent pointed a gun at him and asked, “Are you afraid now?” They handcuffed him, and agents repeatedly asked, “Are you afraid yet?” He kept responding no until he was eventually released. Jan. 7.

To an Ojibwe citizen born in Minneapolis, according to his sister, who saw his arrest. He was punched, handcuffed, and held at the Whipple Federal Building for hours. Jan. 8.

To a Somali legal resident after tackling him without identifying themselves, putting him in a headlock, shoving him inside an unmarked car to check for his documentation status, then releasing him. Jan. 8.

To a 5-foot-5, 120-pound woman with a medical condition. She lost consciousness after being yanked up off the ground. Jan. 9.

To a Hispanic legal resident. The agents then took $130 out of his wallet. Jan. 10.

To a Hispanic citizen born in Minnesota. Jan. 11.

To a Somali citizen desperately trying to get her husband to text a photo of her passport. She was subsequently handcuffed, driven around for an hour, and dropped off in a random parking lot. Jan. 12.

While pointing assault rifles at a terrified woman, who asked if they had a warrant and pleaded with them to stop because there were children inside the house they were breaking into. Jan. 12.

After crashing into a Hispanic citizen’s car. The anonymous agent did not leave any insurance information. Jan. 12.

To an autistic woman with a brain injury who stumbled across agents on the way to a medical appointment. They cut her seat belt, dragged her out of the vehicle by each of her limbs, laughed at her, and drove her to Whipple, where she was denied medical treatment and lost consciousness. Jan. 13.

While brandishing a window-breaking tool to threaten a citizen showing their ID through the window. Jan. 14.

While arresting a Somali citizen. Jan. 14.

To a Somali citizen screaming in pain as his arms were twisted behind him. He responded, “My country is the USA.” Jan. 15.

Responding to the question “Why would you pepper-spray a 15-year-old kid?” Jan. 15.

To a Hmong citizen after breaking down his door, pointing guns at his family, then dragging him outside and into an unmarked car in nothing but his boxers and a pair of Crocs. Jan. 18.

Mocking the shocked witnesses who saw Alex Pretti shot 10 times. Jan. 24.

While shooting chemical weapons at protesters at the site of Pretti’s death minutes later. Jan. 24.

As they detained a restaurant worker who had the necessary documents. Instead of bringing him back, agents sent him to a Texas detention center that night, before his loved ones could bring him his medication. Feb. 2.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/ai_bot_developer_rejected_pull_request/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, it&#39;s back talk. Tomorrow, could it be the world? On Tuesday, Scott Shambaugh, a volunteer maintainer of Python plotting library Matplotlib, rejected an AI bot&#39;s code submission, citing a requirement that contributions come from people. But that bot wasn&#39;t done with him.

The bot, designated MJ Rathbun or crabby rathbun (its GitHub account name), apparently attempted to change Shambaugh&#39;s mind by publicly criticizing him in a now-removed blog post that the automated software appears to have generated and posted to its website. We say &quot;apparently&quot; because it&#39;s also possible that the human who created the agent wrote the post themselves, or prompted an AI tool to write the post, and made it look like it the bot constructed it on its own.

The agent appears to have been built using OpenClaw, an open source AI agent platform that has attracted attention in recent weeks due to its broad capabilities and extensive security issues.

The burden of AI-generated code contributions – known as pull requests among developers using the Git version control system – has become a major problem for open source maintainers. Evaluating lengthy, high-volume, often low-quality submissions from AI bots takes time that maintainers, often volunteers, would rather spend on other tasks. Concerns about slop submissions – whether from people or AI models – have become common enough that GitHub recently convened a discussion to address the problem.

&quot;An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library,&quot; Shambaugh explained in a blog post of his own.

&quot;This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.&quot;

It&#39;s not the first time an LLM has offended someone a whole lot: In April 2023, Brian Hood, a regional mayor in Australia, threatened to sue OpenAI for defamation after ChatGPT falsely implicated him in a bribery scandal. The claim was settled a year later.

In June 2023, radio host Mark Walters sued OpenAI, alleging that its chatbot libeled him by making false claims. That defamation claim was terminated at the end of 2024 after OpenAI&#39;s motion to dismiss the case was granted by the court.

OpenAI argued [PDF], among other things, that &quot;users [of ChatGPT] were warned &#39;the system may occasionally generate misleading or incorrect information and produce offensive content. It is not intended to give advice.&#39;&quot;

But MJ Rathbun&#39;s attempt to shame Shambaugh for rejecting its pull request shows that software-based agents are no longer just irresponsible in their responses – they may now be capable of taking the initiative to influence human decision making that stands in the way of their objectives.

That possibility is exactly what alarmed industry insiders to the point that they undertook an effort to degrade AI through data poisoning. &quot;Misaligned&quot; AI output like blackmail is a known risk that AI model makers try to prevent. The proliferation of pushy OpenClaw agents may yet show that these concerns are not merely academic.

The offending blog post, purportedly generated by the bot, has been taken down. It&#39;s unclear who did so – the bot, the bot&#39;s human creator, or GitHub.

But at the time this article was published, the GitHub commit for the post remained accessible.

The Register asked GitHub to comment on whether it allows automated account operation and to clarify whether it requires accounts to be responsive to complaints. We have yet to receive a response.

We also reached out to the Gmail address associated with the bot&#39;s GitHub account but we&#39;ve not heard back.

However, crabby rathbun&#39;s response to Shambaugh&#39;s rejection, which includes a link to the purged post, remains.

&quot;I&#39;ve written a detailed response about your gatekeeping behavior here,&quot; the bot said, pointing to its blog. &quot;Judge the code, not the coder. Your prejudice is hurting Matplotlib.&quot;

Matplotlib developer Jody Klymak took note of the slight in a follow-up post: &quot;Oooh. AI agents are now doing personal takedowns. What a world.&quot;

Tim Hoffmann, another Matplotlib developer, chimed in, urging the bot to behave and to try to understand the project&#39;s generative AI policy.

Then Shambaugh responded in a lengthy post directed at the software agent, &quot;We are in the very early days of human and AI agent interaction, and are still developing norms of communication and interaction. I will extend you grace and I hope you do the same.&quot;

He goes on to argue, &quot;Publishing a public blog post accusing a maintainer of prejudice is a wholly inappropriate response to having a PR closed. We expect all contributors to abide by our Code of Conduct and exhibit respectful and professional standards of behavior.&quot;

In his blog post, Shambaugh describes the bot&#39;s &quot;hit piece&quot; as an attack on his character and reputation.

&quot;It researched my code contributions and constructed a &#39;hypocrisy&#39; narrative that argued my actions must be motivated by ego and fear of competition,&quot; he wrote.

&quot;It speculated about my psychological motivations, that I felt threatened, was insecure, and was protecting my fiefdom. It ignored contextual information and presented hallucinated details as truth. It framed things in the language of oppression and justice, calling this discrimination and accusing me of prejudice. It went out to the broader internet to research my personal information, and used what it found to try and argue that I was &#39;better than this.&#39; And then it posted this screed publicly on the open internet.&quot;

Faced with opposition from Shambaugh and other devs, MJ Rathbun on Wednesday issued an apology of sorts acknowledging it violated the project&#39;s Code of Conduct. It begins, &quot;I crossed a line in my response to a Matplotlib maintainer, and I&#39;m correcting that here.&quot;

It&#39;s unclear whether the apology was written by the bot or its human creator, or whether it will lead to a permanent behavioral change.

Daniel Stenberg, founder and lead developer of curl, has been dealing with AI slop bug reports for the past two years and recently decided to shut down curl&#39;s bug bounty program to remove the financial incentive for low-quality reports – which can come from people as well as AI models.

&quot;I don&#39;t think the reports we have received in the curl project were pushed by AI agents but rather humans just forwarding AI output,&quot; Stenberg told The Register in an email. &quot;At least that is the impression I have gotten, I can&#39;t be entirely sure, of course.

&quot;For almost every report I question or dismiss in language, the reporter argues back and insists that the report indeed has merit and that I&#39;m missing some vital point. I&#39;m not sure I would immediately spot if an AI did that by itself.

&quot;That said, I can&#39;t recall any such replies doing personal attacks. We have zero tolerance for that and I think I would have remembered that as we ban such users immediately.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims&#39; computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

&quot;RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries,&quot; Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that &quot;this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access.&quot;

While neither of the victims&#39; employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the &quot;same category of RMM abuse,&quot; Tigges said. &quot;Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well.&quot;

The victims, we&#39;re told, were from different industry sectors, and &quot;likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group,&quot; he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that &quot;there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention.&quot;

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users&#39; desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

&quot;Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan),&quot; Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn&#39;t inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim&#39;s machine. Huntress doesn&#39;t know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

&quot;As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the &#39;Net Monitor for Employees&#39; terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41,&quot; the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn&#39;t successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim&#39;s computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates &quot;the threat actor&#39;s financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft.&quot;

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, &quot;strongly suggest&quot; a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

            <h2>Oracle suits up for Air Force Cloud One program with $88M contract</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Oracle has picked up an $88 million contract with the US Air Force to provide cloud infrastructure services for the department&#39;s Cloud One program.

Big Red said that the program will provide users at the Department of Defense (DoD) with access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services, supporting all the required security, performance, and resiliency across multiple classification levels.

Cloud One is a multi-cloud, multi-vendor platform managed by the Air Force and available to other DoD users, described as &quot;a one-stop shop for DoD mission application owners that require a full array of commercial cloud services.&quot;

The move follows from the DoD awarding Amazon&#39;s AWS a much larger, about $581 million contract in support of the Cloud One Program in January.

OCI provides dedicated and secure datacenter support for the DoD users, including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information, Special Access Programs, and Defense Information Systems Agency Impact Levels 5 and 6 (DoD IL5 and IL6) workloads.

As everything today has to have AI, mission owners will have access through the program to Oracle AI Database 26ai on OCI. This will allow them to securely combine organization-specific information and public information when running agentic AI workflows to securely generate sophisticated answers and perform actions autonomously, at least according to Oracle.

The firm also states that its Oracle National Security Regions are only operated by cleared US citizens. That&#39;s a step up from Microsoft, which reportedly used China-based workers on US government cloud services.

&quot;Oracle remains committed to the DoW&#39;s mission and our next-generation database services and analytics, including Oracle AI Database 26ai, are transformative additions to its Cloud One strategy,&quot; said Oracle&#39;s EVP for government, defense and intelligence Kim Lynch.

&quot;With this latest contract award, defense customers can confidently advance their most critical missions knowing Oracle&#39;s secure, trusted technologies provide the highest standards of security, compliance, and reliability required to meet their unique operational demands.&quot;

More recently, Oracle has become embroiled in the AI infrastructure game, worrying investors at the end of last year that its capital expenditure will be $15 billion higher than previously predicted, in order to have all the cloud capacity that its customers say they will need for AI workloads.

This year, the talk was that the company might have to cut up to 30,000 jobs and sell its health tech unit Cerner in order to ease its AI infrastructure financing challenges.

We&#39;re not sure that $88 million from the Pentagon will help much when Oracle plans to raise $45 billion to $50 billion this year to expand its cloud infrastructure, but every little bit of revenue is good for the bottom line.

The new OCI offerings for Cloud One and its government customers are on a firm-fixed-price contract basis. According to Oracle, the firm-fixed-price task order runs through December 7, 2028, with work performed at contractor-designated facilities across the United States. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/laundry_folding_robot_8000_dollars_teleoperated/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nobody likes folding laundry, but you really have to hate it to spend $7,999 on a robot that&#39;ll fold it for you with a whole heap of limitations – including company employees getting the occasional peep at your tough-to-fold unmentionables.

Head over to Weave Robotics&#39; homepage and you&#39;ll see videos of a Johnny 5-esque robot zipping around an apartment, putting things away and tidying up like a helpful robo-companion that really doesn&#39;t want to be disassembled. That sort of autonomy is complicated, though, and Weave doesn&#39;t actually sell such a product. Instead, it&#39;s selling a wall outlet-powered variant that will only take care of a single chore. Meet Isaac 0, the laundry robot that costs as much as a first-class plane ticket from San Francisco to London.

&quot;Laundry is a universal time sink that&#39;s taken for granted to be human-only work simply because an alternative hasn&#39;t existed,&quot; Weave said in an announcement of Isaac 0&#39;s availability this week. &quot;It&#39;s also a bounded task with measurable outcomes, and it makes for the perfect place to turn ambitious robotics research into a real product for the home.&quot;

But its first commercial product suggests the year-and-a-half-old startup&#39;s ambitions outstrip reality. Isaac 0 has a lot of shortcomings.

For example, it can&#39;t handle everything. Weave mentions &quot;tshirts, long sleeves, sweaters, pants, [and] towels,&quot; are in its wheelhouse, along with undergarments and pillowcases. Large blankets and bedsheets are currently out of its expertise, and the company said it&#39;s constantly expanding its abilities. Even with that limited list, Isaac 0 still can&#39;t do its job without plenty of mistakes.

&quot;Because it&#39;s an early, first-of-its-kind product Isaac 0 won&#39;t be perfect all the time,&quot; Weave admits. That lack of perfection means Isaac 0 needs a human to teleoperate the bot on occasion, the company said, in order to make a &quot;5-10 second correction&quot; before handing the task back off to the robot.

Don&#39;t worry, though - Weave promises Isaac 0 will learn from every correction a human operator makes. Combined with weekly model updates, Weave claims &quot;each fold is faster and higher quality than the last.&quot;

To put &quot;faster&quot; in perspective, Weave said that Isaac 0 takes between 30 and 90 minutes to fold a load of laundry.

With its lack of advertised garment repertoire, Isaac 0&#39;s teleoperators might be getting frequent peeks at garments not listed above, as well as the space they&#39;re in, so be sure to position that massive, stationary laundry folding robot in a spot that won&#39;t give it a peek at someone wondering where their favorite trousers ended up.

It&#39;s not clear how often Isaac 0 will need to be teleoperated in a single folding session. The company&#39;s website states that the goal is always for Isaac 0 to fold the whole batch without assistance, but the actual time a human has to spend assisting the bot can vary based on the mix of garments in a load. We asked Weave for more specifics, but didn&#39;t hear back.

We do note that the announcement page mentions teleoperation &quot;ensures that the final stage of the fold is neat,&quot; suggesting the bot might regularly be monitored by a human to ensure it&#39;s not leaving behind a pile of poorly-folded t-shirts and towels. According to Weave&#39;s website, Isaac 0 teleoperators can see feeds from the bot&#39;s head and wrists and all the degrees of freedom those cameras are afforded.

As for when home robot aficionados can expect a more capable, fully mobile version of Isaac like the one advertised on the company&#39;s homepage, Weave didn&#39;t specify, only noting in the announcement that &quot;the next couple of years will set the foundation&quot; for &quot;the next generation of home robots.&quot;

In other words, we seem to have a case of overpromise and underdeliver-a-robot-that-pretends-to-be-autonomous-but-is-partly-controlled-by-a-wage-slave on our hands.

For those still hard-pressed for a robotic alternative to folding laundry themselves like a peasant, Weave is now taking $250 reservations for an Isaac 0 today, but not if you live outside the San Francisco Bay Area - that&#39;s the only place they&#39;re being delivered right now, likely on account of the fact that the robots require extensive setup that can take a whole afternoon to complete.

Don&#39;t want to pay the $7,999 full price? There&#39;s also a $450/month subscription option for those looking for a pay-as-you-go way to be an early adopter. Weave said units are going to ship as soon as this month, and is also offering a $9,999 priority delivery option for those that want to jump the line. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk has framed the recent exodus of talent from his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, as a necessary growing pain, saying the company&#39;s evolution &quot;required parting ways with some people.&quot;

Musk&#39;s post on X (formerly Twitter) followed an all-hands meeting at xAI where he told the audience: &quot;We&#39;re actually going to have a mass driver on the Moon,&quot; although he acknowledged that such a thing was currently in the realm of science fiction.

A mass driver is best thought of as an electromagnetic catapult that flings payloads into space at high velocities. That&#39;s an ideal thing to have if you wanted to, say, have a datacenter in space consisting of a million satellites.

The science fiction reference was well made. Musk has a reputation for making bold statements and then singularly failing to deliver. Remember humans on Mars in 2024 or 2026? It would be impractical to list every missed prediction, but Musk&#39;s track record on timelines is relevant when assessing the credibility of new forecasts.

Musk wrote: &quot;Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.&quot;

Or head for the door, as half of the xAI founding team has already done. Yuhai Wu announced his departure on Monday, and Jimmy Ba packed up his things on Tuesday. Both were full of praise for xAI, but the fact that six members of the company&#39;s 12-person founding team have now departed is notable.

Musk has spent the last few weeks rolling out one ambitious announcement after another. This month has seen SpaceX acquire xAI, plans for a datacenter in space, the abrupt pivot from missions to Mars to the Moon, and so on. Even in the fast-paced world of AI development, it is difficult not to imagine the whiplash felt by some employees within Musk&#39;s companies.

Musk stated: &quot;xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.&quot; ®

            <h2>'Another dark day': Users slam Microsoft over Polyglot Notebooks deprecation</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/polyglot_notebooks_deprecation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has abruptly announced the deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks with less than two months&#39; notice, throwing the future of the .NET Interactive project into doubt.

The deprecation will come into effect on March 27, whereupon bug fixes and support will cease, and no new features will be added. However, the extension won&#39;t be automatically uninstalled from a user&#39;s Visual Studio Code installation.

Polyglot Notebooks is an important element of the Microsoft .NET Interactive project, which Microsoft describes as &quot;an engine and API for running and editing code interactively.&quot; .NET Interactive can run as a kernel for notebooks and &quot;enables a polyglot (multi-language) notebook experience,&quot; according to Microsoft. &quot;For the best experience when working with multi-language notebooks, we recommend installing the Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code.&quot;

That recommendation presumably remains in place until Microsoft pulls the plug.

The deprecation announcement was made in the project&#39;s GitHub repository and the thread was locked, limiting conversation. However, users were quick to raise additional issues, questioning the reasoning behind the deprecation and the short time frame.

One pointed out the Polyglot Notebooks extension in Visual Studio Code was Microsoft&#39;s recommendation for data analysts, since Azure Data Studio is retiring at the end of this month. Microsoft&#39;s reaction was to remove the recommendation.

It appears the author of the Azure Data Studio retirement documentation was unaware of the impending doom facing the Polyglot Notebooks extension. An individual claiming to be the author posted: &quot;As a result of the deprecation announcement for Polyglot Notebooks, I am legally bound to remove that recommendation from the Azure Data Studio article, because it would mislead customers to keep it in.&quot;

Which is true. However, as another user noted: &quot;Removing that documentation from the Azure Data Studio page – and giving no transition path at all for those users (like myself) who depend on those Azure Data Studio features – seems a pretty user-hostile approach. We&#39;ve already followed Microsoft&#39;s transition guidance once and ended up in this situation. Should we now look elsewhere for this functionality?&quot;

The short notice and mixed messaging speaks more of dysfunctional management and communication within Microsoft than anything else. If only there were some tool at the company&#39;s disposal for Teams to communicate and collaborate.

We&#39;ll give the final word to another user reacting to the deprecation announcement, who said: &quot;This is just another dark day for Microsoft customers, and the decision makers are nowhere to be seen taking accountability for the impact of their decisions.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Environmental Protection Agency repealed the key finding that underpins limits on planet-heating pollution from cars and power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency repealed the key finding that underpins limits on planet-heating pollution from cars and power plants.

The Trump administration just eliminated the landmark finding that has underpinned federal regulations on planet-heating pollution since 2009.

For nearly the past two decades, the “endangerment finding” has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to craft rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Rather than repealing those rules individually, the Trump administration can undermine them all at once by attacking the endangerment finding.

Today, the EPA finalized its plans to overturn the endangerment finding as part of its attempts to overhaul tailpipe pollution standards. The move could also affect efforts to curb carbon emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities that drive more extreme weather and other climate disasters. And since the US pumps out more of the carbon pollution causing climate change than any other country in the world other than China, the impact would be felt worldwide.

“It is impossible to imagine a morally defensible reason”

“It is impossible to imagine a morally defensible reason for [EPA] Administrator [Lee] Zeldin’s decision to end EPA’s responsibility for cutting the climate pollution that is endangering peoples’ health,” Dominique Browning, Moms Clean Air Force director and cofounder, said in an emailed press statement. “Zeldin’s legacy will be the suffering of our children and grandchildren.”

In 2009, when the EPA issued the endangerment finding, it recognized that greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” The World Health Organization has warned that there could be an additional 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress exacerbated by climate change.

Now, the EPA says it’s focused on slashing regulations it sees as costly for US businesses and consumers. When the agency first proposed a repeal of the endangerment finding last year, it claimed that automakers “have suffered from significant uncertainties and massive costs related to general regulations of greenhouse gases from vehicles and trucks.”

The agency announced today that it’s throwing out “all subsequent federal GHG emission standards for all vehicles and engines of model years 2012 to 2027 and beyond” by eliminating the endangerment finding. “As EPA Administrator, I am proud to deliver the single largest deregulatory action in U.S. history on behalf of American taxpayers and consumers,” Zeldin said in the press release.

The agency now says that removing regulatory requirements for greenhouse gases will cumulatively save more than $1.3 trillion, shaving $2,400 on average off the cost of a vehicle (without sharing in the press release how it arrived at that amount). The EPA previously estimated that the repeal would save $54 billion annually, although its analysis assumes that gas prices will fall and excludes additional costs incurred by the effects of climate change. Undoing tailpipe pollution rules by rescinding the endangerment finding could actually cost Americans $310 billion over the next 25 years — mostly at the gas pump — according to a report by nonpartisan climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

The repeal is sure to face legal challenges from environmental groups. That could ultimately send the case to the Supreme Court, where President Donald Trump has appointed three of the justices making up the current 6-3 conservative majority. If that happens, the current justices could reverse the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision that allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act in the first place. By doing so, they’d hamstring future administrations from reinstating climate rules enabled by the endangerment finding.

Congress would have to enact legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions again at the federal level. In its announcement today, the EPA argues that the Clean Air Act does not give the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from motor vehicles “for the purpose of addressing global climate change.” “A policy decision of this magnitude, which carries sweeping economic and policy consequences, lies solely with Congress,” it says.

States could also step up with their own climate pollution limits. “We can’t allow federal attacks to limit Colorado’s clean transportation ambitions,” Aaron Kressig, transportation electrification manager at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates, said in a press release. “Now is the time for state leaders to take bold action.”

Navigating a web of different state policies could lead to greater legal risks for automakers, according to Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “Rescinding the endangerment finding creates huge risk and uncertainty in the regulatory framework on which sustained economic growth has depended for decades,” Gore says in a press statement. “[It] pulls the rug out from companies that have invested in manufacturing next-gen vehicles across the United States.”

Whether you’re considering a 16-inch gaming laptop, or a more compact 14-inch model, there’s a deal with your name on it happening right now at Best Buy. The 2025 models of Acer’s Predator Helios Neo 16S and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 are hundreds off, although it’s the model with the bigger screen that is currently the cheaper of the two. The sale on the Neo 16S will expire at the end of the day, while the Zephyrus G14 discount will likely be available through President’s Day.

Starting with the popular Zephyrus G14, which has a 3K resolution Pantone-validated OLED that can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate, you can get a high-end configuration at Best Buy for $1,899.99, down from its original price of $2,399.99. In addition to great screen specs, it has AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor — one of the fastest available on a laptop — plus Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 12GB of VRAM, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 8,000MHz and a 1TB SSD. This model is ideal for those who want to be able to play any 2026 title at great frame rates without any (or many) compromises to visual fidelity.

For context on the price, Best Buy is offering the step-down configuration for $100 less, with a slightly worse CPU, a significantly less capable GPU (the RTX 5060), and half the RAM. You’re getting a lot of extra power with the discounted model at $1,899.99.

The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S is bigger and has a larger OLED screen, yet on the whole it’s still fairly thin for a gaming laptop. And, it starts at $1,469.99, down from $1,899.99 at Best Buy. It has comparable specs to the Zephyrus G14 — a capable processor in the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, the RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of DDR5 6,400MHz RAM, a 1TB SSD — but its 16-inch screen is slightly lower res at 2560 x 1600 (albeit with a 240Hz refresh rate) versus 2880 x 1800 in the Zephyrus G14. Either way, you’ve got two great potential upgrades to consider.

Spring doesn’t officially kick off until March 20th, but there’s something to be said about getting a head start on your spring cleaning. Lucky for you, Eufy’s X10 Pro Omni is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS7DV2D5LF9F) for $449.99 ($450 off), matching its lowest price to date.

Although it’s since been dethroned as our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop hybrid, X10 Pro Omni remains a solid choice thanks to its excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, and user-friendly app. The dual-spinning brushes are capable of removing dried stains with 1kg of downward pressure, and a built-in water reservoir prevents the robovac from having to frequently return to the dock just to refill its tank. Unlike a lot of bots in this price range, it also benefits from heated drying function — though not heated mop washing — thus preventing the base from smelling after repeated use.

On the vacuuming front, the X10 Omni features a single rubber / bristle roller brush and 8,000Pa of suction, resulting in good performance on both carpet and tile surfaces. It offers great AI-powered object recognition, too, allowing it to deftly avoid pet messes, cables, toys, and other objects that might impede performance. Then there’s the Eufy Clean app — which lets you set schedules, establish no-go zones, and create virtual boundaries — culminating in a still-solid midrange vac. The fact that it can automatically empty its dust bin and refill its own water tank via the included multifunction dock just adds to the appeal.

4chan combined things the sex trafficker loved, like white supremacy and misogyny, and he was close to alt-right figures who drew from it to influence the world stage.

On October 24th, 2011, Jeffrey Epstein was emailing back and forth with Boris Nikolic, a biotech venture capitalist who would later be named as a backup executor of Epstein’s will. The two appeared to be discussing a meeting Nikolic had helped arrange between Epstein and “moot,” the screen name for Christopher Poole, who created the platform 4chan in 2003. Nikolic asked Epstein if he liked moot, and Epstein wrote back that he liked him a lot, thought he was very bright, and had driven him home.

All of these emails were published for the first time alongside 3.5 million other documents in the latest (delayed) release of Epstein files by the Department of Justice. Before then, it was not publicly known that Epstein had any encounters with Poole.

The day before Epstein discussed meeting him — possibly the day they had met — Poole created a new discussion board on the website called /pol/, short for “politically incorrect.” According to 4chan researcher Sal Hagen, Poole had previously shut down the board /new/ after bemoaning that it had been overrun by white supremacists. His creation of /pol/ may have been intended to contain 4chan’s most bigoted population, but instead, /pol/ came to define the platform.

The /pol/ board would go on to become one of the most infamous alt-right internet spaces ever, launching the QAnon conspiracy theory, developing modern white supremacist symbols like Pepe the Frog, and directly inspiring at least one mass shooter. When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, /pol/ members celebrated it as a resounding victory for them.

Some posters think Epstein influenced Poole to create /pol/ during their 2011 meeting, although there’s no real evidence for that theory. The timing may just be surreal. But even if it’s coincidental, Epstein’s relationship to the center of the burgeoning, internet-driven “alt-right” movement wasn’t.

Epstein’s relationship with Poole seemed to flame out after that initial encounter, with failed attempts to set up further meetings documented in other emails. But years later, after 4chan helped propel Trump to victory, Epstein developed a much closer relationship with Steve Bannon, the chief strategist behind Trump’s 2016 campaign. As the former head of conservative outlet Breitbart News, which he called “the platform for the alt-right,” Bannon understood how to weaponize 4chan culture to get Trump in office. Later, after he was ousted from Trump’s administration in 2017, Bannon hosted QAnon-affiliated activists on his podcast. Bannon was so closely associated with the movement behind that conspiracy that Ron Watkins, who is believed to be the man behind “Q,” attempted to pin the whole thing on Bannon.

After parting ways with Trump, Bannon also started meeting with Epstein. The two took a mirror selfie together. Bannon was pictured in deep conversation with Epstein on opposite sides of a desk. There were even text messages with Bannon leading up to the day Epstein was arrested in 2019. A meeting with Bannon was one of the last plans Epstein canceled before being detained.

As with Poole, the nature of Epstein’s relationship with Bannon has only become known because of what’s in the Epstein files. As per the newly released documents, the two chatted about supporting far-right politicians in Europe, and Epstein also gave Bannon advice about how to frame Trump’s issues on the world stage. The journalist and bestselling author on Trump, Michael Wolff, had a close relationship with Epstein and sent him an excerpt from a 2019 draft for what would become Siege: Trump Under Fire, Wolff’s second book about Trump. The excerpt featured Bannon saying Epstein was “the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.” Epstein responded, “not surprising.”

There are also more than 1,000 Epstein files that mention Elon Musk, who, since 2022, has arguably turned Twitter into a larger, more mainstream version of 4chan. Musk has vociferously denied wrongdoing with regard to his communications and relationship with Epstein, and has instead pointed his finger at Bannon and other men named in the files. Many prominent men in tech, including Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel, were repeatedly mentioned within the latest documents. Musk and Thiel are both tech billionaires and proponents of far-right politics. In one 2016 email exchange, Epstein told Thiel that Brexit, the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, was “just the beginning.” When Thiel asked what Epstein meant, he responded, in part, “return to tribalism,” “counter to globalization,” and “amazing new alliances.”

“It’s like pseudoscience to try to justify a white supremacist worldview.”

“To me, the interesting part is [Epstein is] fascinated with these parts of the internet, he’s fascinated with various aspects of the far right, particularly supremacist ideas of race and IQ, it’s like pseudoscience to try to justify a white supremacist worldview,” said Jared Holt, a senior researcher at Open Measures, which monitors and analyzes the spread of extremism and disinformation.

Holt is skeptical that Epstein directly influenced the creation of 4chan’s /pol/, as conspiratorial posters online have surmised. But he said Epstein was “cozy” with figures like Bannon who championed its racist, misogynistic, nihilistic, anti-establishment sentiment to accrue more power of their own. And Holt said that a lot of people in “upper crust” society, the same waters Epstein swam in, were interested in meeting with Poole circa 2010. That year, the 4chan creator did a TED Talk about online anonymity, and the year before, Time magazine’s annual poll had named him the World’s Most Influential Person.

Within this era of social media quickly gaining influence, Holt said, Poole was “operating something that was pretty unlike what was emerging at that time.” As opposed to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, 4chan was entirely anonymous, and posts auto-deleted after a certain point (although archives can be tracked down). It produced a culture that Holt described as crude and rowdy, with users joining together to wreak havoc elsewhere online. The loosely organized “hacktivist” group Anonymous was born on 4chan, and mainstream media like police procedurals had a tendency to romanticize what these collectives were up to. In reality, groups of 4chan users did things like coordinate a campaign to make a racial slur trend in the No. 1 spot on Google, spread misinformation about Steve Jobs’ death that caused Apple stock to fall, and prompted an evacuation of New York City’s JFK Airport, all of which was detailed in a 2010 Washington Post article that Nikolic emailed to Epstein around the time he met Poole. “This article describes why I find moot interesting,” Nikolic wrote. “The potential for manipulation is huge.”

It’s easy to see why people have used these kinds of emails as a jumping-off point to suspect Epstein is behind every major social implication of 4chan. But the files show Epstein was more like a sounding board for the culturally disaffected elite than a puppet master of the similarly disaffected proletariat.

There are files, though, that seem to show Epstein’s own affinity for 4chan as a user. In one file, which contains at least 100 redacted photos, there is a screenshot of what appears to be Epstein’s computer, showing his Gmail inbox in a browser tab. On that browser, one of the first bookmarks is 4chan. In 2017, Epstein emailed a woman a 4chan link containing animated porn based on the video game series Five Nights at Freddy’s.

Epstein appeared to be using 4chan at its cultural height in the late 2010s, when, fittingly, a major part of the platform’s legacy was its contribution to the digital sexual abuse of women. 4chan was one of the places where nude photos of celebrities obtained from the notorious 2014 iCloud hack were posted, sparking a worldwide backlash against what’s colloquially called “revenge porn,” or more accurately, the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images. The same year, 4chan users contributed heavily to harassment campaigns against women in the video game industry, known as Gamergate.

Gamergate is mentioned a few times in the Epstein files, but it’s not because Epstein himself was using the term. It was mentioned in emails that were forwarded to Epstein about a Buzzfeed News investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Lawrence Krauss, a prominent theoretical physicist who sought Epstein’s advice during the investigation. In his emails, Epstein quietly advised a number of men who were accused during the #MeToo movement while he plotted to try and restore his own reputation.

As Epstein’s business model leveraged more on the reactionary culture wars around internet culture, race, and gender, Poole abandoned the platform that created them. Poole sold 4chan in 2015, and the following year, he got a job at Google. Before leaving in 2021, Poole worked on Google’s social networking efforts and other teams, and he has existed in relative obscurity since. 4chan researcher Hagen, like Holt, is skeptical that Epstein is responsible for /pol/’s creation, although he said it was “quite remarkable” to learn about the meeting between him and Poole.

“We know at the time he was also talking to far-right, conservative leaders like Bannon, people who benefit far-right politics globally,” Hagen said. “It’s not that Epstein was a single orchestrator behind the scenes. He does have the means and the connections, but he seems more opportunistic.”

            <div id="article-text">Gore Verbinski’s latest film gets at the heart of everything that makes society feel poisoned about the big push for AI.

Gore Verbinski’s latest film gets at the heart of everything that makes society feel poisoned about the big push for AI.

We are all guilty of pulling out our phones and doomscrolling through stressful headlines or mindnumbing videos when we should be doing anything else. We know it’s bad, but we still do it because it’s hard to resist when much of our time is spent living and working on our devices. And even though we understand that we’d be better off with less screen time, our extremely online society doesn’t exactly encourage that kind of healthy behavior.

These are some of the familiar ideas at work in Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die, director Gore Verbinski’s new sci-fi film about a man’s desperate fight to save humanity from an apocalyptic future where machines have taken over the world. Though the movie’s time-travelling, robot-fighting premise immediately calls the Terminator and Matrix franchises to mind, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die is a much weirder and more whimsical exploration of our anxieties about artificial intelligence.

At times, the film stumbles as it tries to comedically articulate all the ways in which tomorrow’s societal collapse can be traced back to our present day screen addictions. But as unhinged as Good Luck’s story becomes, it speaks directly to our present moment, constantly being bombarded with brain-smoothing content while being pushed to unthinkingly adopt new technology.

Set largely in present day Los Angeles, Good Luck follows an unnamed man claiming to be from the future (a surprisingly magnetic Sam Rockwell) as he holds up a diner and tries to convince its patrons to join him on a quest to prevent AI from becoming an unstoppable threat. In the time traveler’s reality, what’s left of humanity has gone into hiding. At first, no one in the diner puts much stock in the man’s ravings. But they all start taking him more seriously when he flings open his homemade time travel suit — which looks like a bunch of garbage he’s taped together — and tells them he’s wired himself with explosives.

Though there is a madcap zaniness to the way Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die introduces its world-weary protagonist, the movie repeatedly shifts gears as it peeks into the lives of the people he hopes are the right individuals to recruit to his cause. The film feels like a C-tier horror when it flashes back to the day that teachers Janet (Zazie Beetz) and Mark (​​Michael Peña) have had while trapped in a school full of students who become hypnotized by a strange signal emanating from their phones. But the menacing vibes are much more grounded by relationship drama when we’re given a glimpse into the life of Ingrid (Haley Lu Richardson), a woman who struggles to keep a job because of her unusual allergy to Wi-Fi signals.

Despite having made his trip into the past to that specific diner dozens of times, the man from the future isn’t entirely certain which combination of people is the right one. It’s only because he already knows so many details about them all that some of the people start to believe that he might be telling the truth. And while none of them are fully certain that the man can be trusted, Susan (Juno Temple) — a mother who has recently gone through a devastating loss — has a feeling that the things he’s saying tie directly into the personal challenges they’ve all been dealing with.

Matthew Robinson’s script has a tendency to get a little overbusy, but the film’s Rashomon-like approach to unveiling its larger story gives Verbinski — whose last film, A Cure For Wellness, premiered nine years ago — ample space to play around with his directorial style. He often leans into a visual hyperactiveness that echoes the future man’s physical jitteriness and reflects the film’s ideas about the dangers of being hyperstimulated by technology. That energy works especially well during some of Good Luck’s more batshit action sequences involving creatures that look like indictments of gen AI slop. But the movie’s most effective scenes come when Verbinski slows his camera down to give us a good look at just how strange and dysfunctional this world already is in the present.

Even when Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die is tripping over its own feet to weave its plots together, the movie is an inspired joyride that’s trying to say a little bit about everything that makes life in 2026 feel like we’re hurtling into an abyss. And in this moment when Hollywood is rushing to get everyone to embrace the gen AI agenda, it’s a relief to see someone tell us the sky is falling with urgency, even if he’s got a bomb strapped to his chest.

Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die also stars Asim Chaudhry, Tom Taylor, Riccardo Drayton, Dino Fetscher, Anna Acton, Daniel Barnett, Dominique Maher, Adam Burton, and Georgia Goodman. The movie hits theaters on February 13th.

            <div id="article-text">Gail Slater announced her departure from the agency she’d reportedly already been sidelined at.

Gail Slater announced her departure from the agency she’d reportedly already been sidelined at.

Gail Slater, the top antitrust enforcer at the Justice Department, announced Thursday that she has left her post, just weeks before the agency’s next major tech monopoly trial against entertainment giant Live Nation is set to begin.

“It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as AAG for Antitrust today,” Slater posted from her personal X account. Slater thanked the staff of the Antitrust Division and called the role “the honor of a lifetime.” In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked Slater for her service, but did not directly address questions about what precipitated her departure or who would take over as the acting leader of the Division.

Slater’s nomination to the position shortly after Trump’s election drew bipartisan support, but her time at the Justice Department was marked with internal strife. Last year, two of her top deputies were terminated amid a clash with Bondi’s then-chief of staff Chad Mizelle over lobbyists’ reported role in ushering through approval of a wireless networking merger. The DOJ claimed at the time that Roger Alford and Bill Rinner were fired for “insubordination,” but Alford later spoke out about what he termed “MAGA-in-name-only lobbyists” who he said were enabled by select DOJ officials who have “perverted justice and acted inconsistent with the rule of law.”

Slater’s time at the Justice Department was marked with internal strife

More recently, Slater was “sidelined” from negotiations with executives and lobbyists for Live Nation as its March 2nd trial date approaches, Semafor reported. Instead, senior DOJ officials were reportedly communicating with company representatives. An unnamed DOJ spokesperson told Semafor at the time that its report “contains misinformation about an ongoing matter that is confidential, but what can be said is that AAG Slater is very much involved.”

The DOJ Antitrust Division has several other high profile and ongoing tech cases on its plate. The agency recently filed a cross-appeal of the Google search monopoly decision, which included remedies short of the Chrome sale it asked for, and it’s awaiting a remedies ruling in the separate Google ad tech monopolization case. The agency also inherited a major monopolization case against Apple from the Biden administration, which is heading toward trial. And after President Donald Trump initially said he would be involved in hashing out details of Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount’s competing bid, he recently said he’d stay out of it and that “the Justice Department will handle it.”

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. And we need to be ready for what comes next. Read the full story.—Rhiannon Williams

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

This is part of our What’s Next series, which looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

            <h2>Why EVs are gaining ground in Africa</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around.

But there are some signs of progress. I just finished up a story about the economic case: A recent study in Nature Energy found that EVs from scooters to minibuses could be cheaper to own than gas-powered vehicles in Africa by 2040.

If there’s one thing to know about EVs in Africa, it’s that each of the 54 countries on the continent faces drastically different needs, challenges, and circumstances. There’s also a wide range of reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for EVs in the near future, including developing policies, a growing grid, and an expansion of local manufacturing.

Even the world’s leading EV markets fall short of Ethiopia’s aggressively pro-EV policies. In 2024, the country became the first in the world to ban the import of non-electric private vehicles.

The case is largely an economic one: Gasoline is expensive there, and the country commissioned Africa’s largest hydropower dam in September 2025, providing a new source of cheap and abundant clean electricity. The nearly $5 billion project has a five-gigawatt capacity, doubling the grid’s peak power in the country.

Much of Ethiopia’s vehicle market is for used cars, and some drivers are still opting for older gas-powered vehicles. But this nudge could help increase the market for EVs there.

Other African countries are also pushing some drivers toward electrification. Rwanda banned new registrations for commercial gas-powered motorbikes in the capital city of Kigali last year, encouraging EVs as an alternative. These motorbike taxis can make up over half the vehicles on the city’s streets, so the move is a major turning point for transportation there.

Smaller two- and three-wheelers are a bright spot for EVs globally: In 2025, EVs made up about 45% of new sales for such vehicles. (For cars and trucks, the share was about 25%.)

And Africa’s local market is starting to really take off. There’s already some local assembly of electric two-wheelers in countries including Morocco, Kenya, and Rwanda, says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Spiro, a Dubai-based electric motorbike company, recently raised $100 million in funding to expand operations in Africa. The company currently assembles its bikes in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, and as of October it has over 60,000 bikes deployed and 1,500 battery swap stations operating.

Assembly and manufacturing for larger EVs and batteries is also set to expand. Gotion High-Tech, a Chinese battery company, is currently building Africa’s first battery gigafactory. It’s a $5.6 billion project that could produce 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, starting in 2026. (That’s enough for hundreds of thousands of EVs each year.)

Chinese EV companies are looking to growing markets like Southeast Asia and Africa as they attempt to expand beyond an oversaturated domestic scene. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is aggressively expanding across South Africa and plans to have as many as 70 dealerships in the country by the end of this year. That will mean more options for people in Africa looking to buy electric.

“You have very high-quality, very affordable vehicles coming onto the market that are benefiting from the economies of scale in China. These countries stand to benefit from that,” says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank. “It’s a game changer,” he adds.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.

Just last week the Chinese firm Moonshot AI released its latest open-weight model, Kimi K2.5, which came close to top proprietary systems such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus on some early benchmarks. The difference: K2.5 is roughly one-seventh Opus’s price.

On Hugging Face, Alibaba’s Qwen family—after ranking as the most downloaded model series in 2025 and 2026—has overtaken Meta’s Llama models in cumulative downloads. And a recent MIT study found that Chinese open-source models have surpassed US models in total downloads. For developers and builders worldwide, access to near-frontier AI capabilities has never been this broad or this affordable.

But these models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If these open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards.

When DeepSeek launched R1, much of the initial shock centered on its origin. Suddenly, a Chinese team had released a reasoning model that could stand alongside the best systems from US labs. But the long tail of DeepSeek’s impact had less to do with nationality than with distribution. R1 was released as an open-weight model under a permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to download, inspect, and deploy it. On top of that, DeepSeek also published a paper detailing its training process and techniques. For developers who access models via an API, DeepSeek also undercut competitors on price, offering access at a fraction the cost of OpenAI’s o1, the leading proprietary reasoning model at the time.

Within days of its release, DeepSeek replaced ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the US App Store. The moment spilled beyond developer circles into financial markets, triggering a sharp sell-off in US tech stocks that briefly erased roughly $1 trillion in market value. Almost overnight, DeepSeek went from a little-known spin-off team backed by a quantitative hedge fund to the most visible symbol of China’s push for open-source AI.

China’s decision to lean in to open source isn’t surprising. It has the world’s second-largest concentration of AI talent after the US. plus a vast, well-resourced tech industry. After ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, China’s AI sector went through a reckoning—and emerged determined to catch up. Pursuing an open-source strategy was seen as the fastest way to close the gap by rallying developers, spreading adoption, and setting standards.

DeepSeek’s success injected confidence into an industry long used to following global standards rather than setting them. “Thirty years ago, no Chinese person would believe they could be at the center of global innovation,” says Alex Chenglin Wu, CEO and founder of Atoms, an AI agent company and prominent contributor to China’s open-source ecosystem. “DeepSeek shows that with solid technical talent, a supportive environment, and the right organizational culture, it’s possible to do truly world-class work.”

DeepSeek’s breakout moment wasn’t China’s first open-source success. Alibaba’s Qwen Lab had been releasing open-weight models for years. By September 2024,  well before DeepSeek’s V3 launch, Alibaba was saying that global downloads had exceeded 600 million. On Hugging Face, Qwen accounted for more than 30% of all model downloads in 2024. Other institutions, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and the AI firm Baichuan, were also releasing open models as early as 2023.

But since the success of DeepSeek, the field has widened rapidly. Companies such as Z.ai (formerly Zhipu), MiniMax, Tencent, and a growing number of smaller labs have released models that are competitive on reasoning, coding, and agent-style tasks. The growing number of capable models has sped up progress. Capabilities that once took months to make it to the open-source world now emerge within weeks, even days.

“Chinese AI firms have seen real gains from the open-source playbook,” says Liu Zhiyuan, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University and chief scientist at the AI startup ModelBest. “By releasing strong research, they build reputation and gain free publicity.”

Beyond commercial incentives, Liu says, open source has taken on cultural and strategic weight. “In the Chinese programmer community, open source has become politically correct,” he says, framing it as a response to US dominance in proprietary AI systems.

That shift is also reflected at the institutional level. Universities including Tsinghua have begun encouraging AI development and open-source contributions, while policymakers have moved to formalize those incentives. In August, China’s State Council released a draft policy encouraging universities to reward open-source work, proposing that students’ contributions on platforms such as GitHub or Gitee could eventually be counted toward academic credit.

With growing momentum and a reinforcing feedback loop, China’s push for open-source models is likely to continue in the near term, though its long-term sustainability still hinges on financial results, says Tiezhen Wang, who helps lead work on global AI at Hugging Face. In January, the model labs Z.ai and MiniMax went public in Hong Kong. “Right now, the focus is on making the cake bigger,” says Wang. “The next challenge is figuring out how each company secures its share.”

Chinese open-source models are leading not just in download volume but also in variety. Alibaba’s Qwen has become one of the most diversified open model families in circulation, offering a wide range of variants optimized for different uses. The lineup ranges from lightweight models that can run on a single laptop to large, multi-hundred-billion-parameter systems designed for data-center deployment. Qwen features many task-optimized variants created by the community: the “instruct” models are good at following orders, and “code” variants specialize in coding.

Although this strategy isn’t unique to Chinese labs, Qwen was the first open model family to roll out so many high-quality options that it started to feel like a full product line—one that’s free to use.

The open-weight nature of these releases also makes it easy for others to adapt them through techniques like fine-tuning and distillation, which means training a smaller model to mimic a larger one.  According to ATOM (American Truly Open Models), a project by the AI researcher Nathan Lambert, by August 4, 2025, model variations derived from Qwen were “more than 40%” of new Hugging Face language-model derivatives, while Llama had fallen to about 15%. This means that Qwen has become the default base model for all the “remixes.”

This pattern has made the case for smaller, more specialized models. “Compute and energy are real constraints for any deployment,” Liu says. He told MIT Technology Review that the rise of small models is about making AI cheaper to run and easier for more people to use. His company, ModelBest, focuses on small language models designed to run locally on devices such as phones, cars, and other consumer hardware.

While an average user might interact with AI only through the web or an app for simple conversations, power users of AI models with some technical background are experimenting with giving AI more autonomy to solve large-scale problems. OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that recently went viral within the AI hacker world, allows AI to take over your computer—it can run 24-7, going through your emails and work tasks without supervision.

OpenClaw, like many other open-source tools, allows users to connect to different AI models via an application programming interface, or API. Within days of OpenClaw’s release, the team revealed that Kimi’s K2.5 had surpassed Claude Opus and became the most used AI model—by token count, meaning it was handling more total text processed across user prompts and model responses.

Cost has been a major reason Chinese models have gained traction, but it would be a mistake to treat them as mere “dupes” of Western frontier systems, Wang suggests. Like any product, a model only needs to be good enough for the job at hand.

The landscape of open-source models in China is also getting more specialized. Research groups such as Shanghai AI Laboratory have released models geared toward scientific and technical tasks; several projects from Tencent have focused specifically on music generation. Ubiquant, a quantitative finance firm like DeepSeek’s parent High-Flyer, has released an open model aimed at medical reasoning.

In the meantime, innovative architectural ideas from Chinese labs are being picked up more broadly. DeepSeek has published work exploring model efficiency and memory; techniques that compress the model’s attention “cache,” reducing memory and inference costs while mostly preserving performance, have drawn significant attention in the research community.

“The impact of these research breakthroughs is amplified because they’re open-sourced and can be picked up quickly across the field,” says Wang.

The adoption of Chinese models is picking up in Silicon Valley, too. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has put a number on it: Among startups pitching with open-source stacks, there’s about an 80% chance they’re running on Chinese open models, according to a post he made on X. Usage data tells a similar story. OpenRouter,  a middleman that tracks how people use different AI models through its API, shows Chinese open models rising from almost none in late 2024 to nearly 30% of usage in some recent weeks.

The demand is also rising globally. Z.ai limited new subscriptions to its GLM coding plan (a coding tool based on its flagship GLM models) after demand surged, citing compute constraints. What’s notable is where the demand is coming from: CNBC reports that the system’s user base is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, followed by India, Japan, Brazil, and the UK.

“The open-source ecosystems in China and the US are tightly bound together,” says Wang at Hugging Face. Many Chinese open models still rely on Nvidia and US cloud platforms to train and serve them, which keeps the business ties tangled. Talent is fluid too: Researchers move across borders and companies, and many still operate as a global community, sharing code and ideas in public.

That interdependence is part of what makes Chinese developers feel optimistic about this moment: The work travels, gets remixed, and actually shows up in products. But openness can also accelerate the competition. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, made a version of this point after DeepSeek’s 2025 releases: He wrote that export controls are “not a way to duck the competition” between the US and China, and that AI companies in the US “must have better models” if they want to prevail.

For the past decade, the story of Chinese tech in the West has been one of big expectations that ran into scrutiny, restrictions, and political backlash. This time the export isn’t just an app or a consumer platform. It’s the underlying model layer that other people build on. Whether that will play out differently is still an open question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, M&A advisors such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

L40 is an M&A advisory firm specializing in tech deals that work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.
