            <h2>Users flock to open source Moltbot for always-on AI, despite major risks</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/viral-ai-assistant-moltbot-rapidly-gains-popularity-but-poses-security-risks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An open source AI assistant called Moltbot (formerly “Clawdbot”) recently crossed 69,000 stars on GitHub after a month, making it one of the fastest-growing AI projects of 2026. Created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool lets users run a personal AI assistant and control it through messaging apps they already use. While some say it feels like the AI assistant of the future, running the tool as currently designed comes with serious security risks.

Among the dozens of unofficial AI bot apps that never rise above the fray, Moltbot is perhaps most notable for its proactive communication with the user. The assistant works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It can reach out to users with reminders, alerts, or morning briefings based on calendar events or other triggers. The project has drawn comparisons to Jarvis, the AI assistant from the Iron Man films, for its ability to actively attempt to manage tasks across a user’s digital life.

However, we’ll tell you up front that there are plenty of drawbacks to the still-hobbyist software: While the organizing assistant code runs on a local machine, the tool effectively requires a subscription to Anthropic or OpenAI for model access (or using an API key). Users can run local AI models with the bot, but they are currently less effective at carrying out tasks than the best commercial models. Claude Opus 4.5, which is Anthropic’s flagship large language model (LLM), is a popular choice.

Setting up Moltbot requires configuring a server, managing authentication, and understanding sandboxing for even a slice of security in a system that basically demands access to every facet of your digital life. Heavy use can rack up significant API costs, since agentic systems make many calls behind the scenes and use up a lot of tokens.

We’ve only just begun to try Moltbot ourselves (more on that soon), but we’ve seen plenty of discussions circulating in the AI community about the new assistant. The all-in approach has serious security drawbacks, since it requires access to messaging accounts, API keys, and in some configurations, shell commands. Also, an always-on agent with access to messaging channels and personal systems can quickly expand your attack surface.

Even with all the drawbacks listed above, people are still using Moltbot. MacStories editor Federico Viticci, who spent a week testing the tool, described it as “Claude with hands,” referring to how it connects a large language model (LLM) backend with real-world capabilities like browser control, email management, and file operations.

The project’s documentation describes it as a tool for users who want “a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on.”

According to the project’s GitHub page, Steinberger designed the bot to retain long-term memory and execute commands directly on the user’s system, unlike current web-based chatbots from major AI labs. It’s closer to Claude Code and Codex CLI (which also operate on local files using a cloud AI model), but with more latitude to take local actions on the user’s behalf.

Moltbot stores memory as Markdown files and an SQLite database on the user’s machine. It auto-generates daily notes that log interactions and uses vector search to retrieve relevant context from past conversations. The memory persists across sessions because the bot runs as a background daemon.

Compared to Claude Code, which is session-based, Moltbot runs persistently (24/7) and maintains its stored memory indefinitely. It can reportedly recall what you discussed weeks ago. With Claude Code, when you close it, the conversation context is gone (unless you use CLAUDE.md files for project context).

The project’s rapid rise has not come without complications. On Monday, Anthropic asked Steinberger to change the project’s name due to trademark concerns (since “Clawd” sounds like “Claude”), prompting the rebrand from Clawdbot to Moltbot. “Clawdbot” was originally named after the ASCII art creature that appears when you launch Claude Code on a terminal.

However, the transition enabled bad actors to hijack Steinberger’s old social media and GitHub handles, reports The Register. Crypto scammers launched fake tokens using the project’s name, with one reaching a $16 million market cap before crashing. Steinberger responded on X: “Any project that lists me as a coin owner is a SCAM. No, I will not accept fees. You are actively damaging the project.”

Security researchers have also found vulnerabilities in misconfigured public deployments. Bitdefender reported that exposed dashboards allowed outsiders to view configuration data, retrieve API keys, and browse full conversation histories from private chats.

While there’s plenty of hype about Moltbot right now, be advised that any LLM that has access to your local machine is susceptible to prompt injection attacks that can “trick” the AI model to share your personal data with other people or remote servers. While Moltbot offers a glimpse at what future AI assistants from major vendors might look like, it’s still experimental and not yet ready for users who aren’t comfortable trading today’s AI convenience (such as it is) for major security risks.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/heres-the-story-of-how-japans-h3-rocket-lost-its-cargo-and-just-kept-going/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re in the space business long enough, you learn there are numerous ways a rocket can fail. I’ve written my share of stories about misbehaving rockets and the extensive investigations that usually—but not always—reveal what went wrong.

But I never expected to write this story. Maybe this was a failure of my own imagination. I’m used to writing about engine malfunctions, staging issues, guidance glitches, or structural failures. Last April, Ars reported on the bizarre failure of Firefly Aerospace’s commercial Alpha rocket.

Japan’s H3 rocket found a new way to fail last month, apparently eluding the imaginations of its own designers and engineers.

The H3 is a relatively new vehicle, with last month’s launch marking the eighth flight of Japan’s flagship rocket. The launcher falls on the medium-to-heavy section of the lift spectrum. The eighth H3 rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Island in southern Japan on December 22, local time, carrying a roughly 5-ton navigation satellite into space.

The rocket was supposed to place the Michibiki 5 satellite into an orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above the Earth. Everything was going well until the H3 jettisoned its payload fairing, the two-piece clamshell covering the satellite during launch, nearly four minutes into the flight.

Officials from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are starting to get a handle on what happened. Agency officials briefed the government ministry overseeing Japan’s space activities last week, and the presentation (in Japanese) was posted on a government website.

The presentation is rich in information, with illustrations, a fault tree analysis, and a graph of in-flight measurements from sensors on the H3 rocket. It offers a treasure trove of detail and data most launch providers decline to release publicly after a rocket malfunction.

Some of the material is difficult to grasp for a non-Japanese speaker unfamiliar with the subtle intricacies of the H3 rocket’s design. What is clear is that something went wrong when the rocket released its payload shroud. Video beamed back from the rocket’s onboard cameras showed a shower of debris surrounding the satellite, which started wobbling and leaning in the moments after fairing separation. Sensors also detected sudden accelerations around the attachment point connecting the spacecraft with the top of the H3 rocket.

At this point in the mission, the H3 rocket was well above the thick lower layers of the atmosphere. Aerodynamic forces were not a significant factor, but the rocket continued accelerating on the power of its two hydrogen-fueled main engines. The Michibiki 5 satellite held on for a little more than a minute, when the H3’s first stage shut down and separated from the rocket’s second stage.

The jolt from staging dislodged the satellite from its mooring atop the rocket. Then, the second stage lit its engine and left the satellite in the dust. A rear-facing camera on the upper stage captured a fleeting view of the satellite falling back to Earth. In the briefing package, Japanese space officials wrote that Michibiki 5 fell into the Pacific Ocean in the same impact zone as the H3’s first stage.

Whatever caused the satellite to break free of the rocket damaged more than its attach fitting. Telemetry data downlinked from the H3 showed a pressure drop in the second stage’s liquid hydrogen tank after separation of the payload fairing.

“A decrease in LH2 tank pressure was confirmed almost simultaneously,” officials wrote. A pressurization valve continued to open to restore pressure to the tank, but the pressure did not recover. “It is highly likely that the satellite mounting structure was damaged due to some factor, and as a result, the pressurization piping was damaged.”

The second stage engine lost 20 percent of its thrust, but it fired long enough to put the rocket into a low-altitude orbit. The rocket’s temporary recovery was likely aided by the absence of its multi-ton payload, meaning it needed a lower impulse to reach orbital velocity. The orbit was too low to sustain, and the second stage of the H3 rocket reentered the atmosphere and burned up within several hours.

Investigators now have a grasp of what happened, but they are still piecing together why. JAXA presented a fault tree analysis to the Japanese science and technology ministry, showing which potential causes engineers have ruled out, and which ones remain under investigation.

The branches of the fault tree still open include the possibility of an impact or collision between part of the payload fairing and the Michibiki 5 satellite or its mounting structure. Engineers continue to probe the possibility that residual strain energy in the connection between the satellite and the rocket was suddenly released at the moment of fairing separation.

The rocket is supposed to vent pressure inside the fairing as it ascends through thinner air and into space. Measurements from the rocket indicate the pressure inside the fairing decreased as expected during the launch. Officials don’t believe this was a factor in the launch failure, but engineers are examining whether the measurements were in error.

The rocket and satellite also carried combustible propellants, high-pressure gases, and pyrotechnics. “While no data indicating leakage of these substances has been confirmed, the possibility that they caused the abnormal acceleration cannot be ruled out at this time,” JAXA said.

So far, the probe has found no evidence that a structural problem with the satellite itself was the root cause of the failure.

With last month’s incident, the H3 rocket has a record of six successful launches in eight flights. The H3’s debut launch in 2023 faltered due to an ignition failure on the rocket’s second stage.

JAXA must complete the latest H3 failure investigation in the coming months to clear the rocket to launch the nation’s Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) mission in a narrow planetary launch window that opens in October. MMX is an exciting robotic mission to land on and retrieve samples from the Martian moon Phobos for return to Earth. MMX’s launch was previously set for 2024, but Japan’s space agency delayed it to this year due to earlier problems with the H3 rocket.</div>

            <h2>Dozens of CDC vaccination databases have been frozen under RFK Jr.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-lets-cdc-vaccination-data-rot-dozens-of-databases-frozen/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly half of the databases that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were updating on a monthly basis have been frozen without notice or explanation, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The study—led by Janet Freilich, a law expert at Boston University, and Jeremy Jacobs, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University—examined the status of all CDC databases, finding a total of 82 that had, as of early 2025, been receiving updates at least monthly. But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation.

Examining the databases’ content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The most common vaccination types included in the out-of-date data were vaccinations against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Two frozen databases included data on all three vaccines. When the researchers checked in on the databases again in December, only one had been updated, leaving 37 still entirely out of date.

The finding stood out given that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a fervent anti-vaccine advocate who has worked for decades to undermine trust in and use of life-saving vaccines.

“Given the vaccine skepticism of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it is concerning that nearly 90 percent of the paused databases related to vaccination surveillance, with additional gaps in respiratory disease monitoring,” Freilich, Jacobs, and their co-authors write in the study.

Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.

In an accompanying editorial, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”

The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be due to the direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.

“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.

Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC, writing: Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/tiktok-claimed-bugs-blocked-anti-ice-videos-epstein-mentions-experts-call-bs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok wants users to believe that errors blocking uploads of anti-ICE videos or direct messages mentioning Jeffrey Epstein are due to technical errors—not the platform shifting to censor content critical of Donald Trump after he hand-picked the US owners who took over the app last week.

However, experts say that TikTok users’ censorship fears are justified, whether the bugs are to blame or not.

Ioana Literat, an associate professor of technology, media, and learning at Teachers College, Columbia University, has studied TikTok’s politics since the app first shot to popularity in the US in 2018. She told Ars that “users’ fears are absolutely justified” and explained why the “bugs” explanation is “insufficient.”

“Even if these are technical glitches, the pattern of what’s being suppressed reveals something significant,” Literat told Ars. “When your ‘bug’ consistently affects anti-Trump content, Epstein references, and anti-ICE videos, you’re looking at either spectacular coincidence or systems that have been designed—whether intentionally or through embedded biases—to flag and suppress specific political content.”

TikTok users are savvy, Literat noted, and what’s being cast as “paranoia” about the app’s bugs actually stems from their “digital literacy,” she suggested.

“They’ve watched Instagram suppress Palestine content, they’ve seen Twitter’s transformation under Musk, they’ve experienced shadow-banning and algorithmic suppression, including on TikTok prior to this,” Literat said. “So, their pattern recognition isn’t paranoia, but rather digital literacy.”

Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and Internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder, agreed that TikTok’s “bugs” explanation wasn’t enough to address users’ fears. She told CNN that TikTok risks losing users’ trust the longer that errors damage the perception of the app.

“Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler told CNN.

Some users are already choosing to leave TikTok. A quick glance at the TikTok subreddit shows many users grieving while vowing to delete the app, Literat pointed out, though some are reportedly struggling to delete accounts due to technical issues. Even with some users blocked from abandoning their accounts, however, “the daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150 percent in the last five days compared to the last three months,” data analysis firm Sensor Tower told CNN.

A TikTok USDS spokesperson told Ars that US owners have not yet made any changes to the algorithm or content moderation policies. So far, the only changes have been to the US app’s terms of use and privacy policy, which impacted what location data is collected, how ads are targeted, and how AI interactions are monitored.

For TikTok, the top priority appears to be fixing the bugs, which were attributed to a power outage at a US data center. A TikTok USDS spokesperson told NPR that TikTok is also investigating the issue where some users can’t talk about Epstein in DMs.

“We don’t have rules against sharing the name ‘Epstein’ in direct messages and are investigating why some users are experiencing issues,” TikTok’s spokesperson said.

TikTok’s response came after California Governor Gavin Newsom declared on X that “it’s time to investigate” TikTok.

“I am launching a review into whether TikTok is violating state law by censoring Trump-critical content,” Newsom said. His post quote-tweeted an X user who shared a screenshot of the error message TikTok displayed when some users referenced Epstein and joked, “so the agreement for TikTok to sell its US business to GOP-backed investors was finalized a few days ago,” and “now you can’t mention Epstein lmao.”

As of Tuesday afternoon, the results of TikTok’s investigation into the “Epstein” issue were not publicly available, but TikTok may post an update here as technical issues are resolved.

“We’ve made significant progress in recovering our US infrastructure with our US data center partner,” TikTok USDS’s latest statement said. “However, the US user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates.”

For TikTok’s new owners, the tech issues risk confirming fears that Trump wasn’t joking when he said he’d like to see TikTok be tweaked to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Because of this bumpy transition, it seems likely that TikTok will continue to be heavily scrutinized once the USDS joint venture officially starts retraining the app on US data. As the algorithm undergoes tweaks, frequent TikTok users will likely be the first to pick up on subtle changes, especially if content unaligned with their political views suddenly starts appearing in their feeds when it never did before, Literat suggested.

Literat has researched both left- and right-leaning TikTok content. She told Ars that although left-leaning young users have for years loudly used the app to promote progressive views on topics like racial justice, gun reforms, or climate change, TikTok has never leaned one way or the other on the political spectrum.

Consider Christian or tradwife TikTok, Literat suggested, which grew huge platforms on TikTok alongside leftist bubbles advocating for LGBTQ+ rights or Palestine solidarity.

“Political life on TikTok is organized into overlapping sub-communities, each with its own norms, humor, and tolerance for disagreement,” Literat said, adding that “the algorithm creates bubbles, so people experience very different TikToks.”

Literat told Ars that she wasn’t surprised when Trump suggested that TikTok would be better if it were more right-wing. But what concerned her most was the implication that Trump viewed TikTok “as a potential propaganda apparatus” and “a tool for political capture rather than a space for authentic expression and connection.”

“The historical irony is thick: we went from ‘TikTok is dangerous because it’s controlled by the Chinese government and might manipulate American users’ to ‘TikTok should be controlled by American interests and explicitly aligned with a particular political agenda,’” Literat said. “The concern was never really about foreign influence or manipulation per se—it was about who gets to do the influencing.”

David Greene, senior counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which fought the TikTok ban law, told Ars that users are justified in feeling concerned. However, technical errors or content moderation mistakes are nearly always the most likely explanations for issues, and there’s no way to know “what’s actually happening.” He noted that lawmakers have shaped how some TikTok users view the app after insisting that they accept that China was influencing the algorithm without providing evidence.

“For years, TikTok users were being told that they just needed to follow these assumptions the government was making about the dangers of TikTok,” Greene said. And “now they’re doing the same thing, making these assumptions that it’s now maybe some content policy is being done either to please the Trump administration or being controlled by it. We conditioned TikTok users to basically to not have trust in the way decisions were made with the app.”

TikTok USDS likely wants to distance itself from Trump’s comments about making the app more MAGA. But new owners have deep ties with Trump, including Larry Ellison, the chief technology officer of Oracle, whom some critics suggest has benefited more than anyone else from Trump’s presidency. Greene noted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a key investor in Silver Lake. Both firms now have a 15 percent stake in the TikTok USDS joint venture, as well as MGX, which also seems to have Trump ties. CNBC reported MGX used the Trump family cryptocurrency, World Liberty Financial, to invest $2 billion in Binance shortly before Trump pardoned Binance’s CEO from money laundering charges, which some viewed as a possible quid pro quo.

Greene said that EFF warned during the Supreme Court fight over the TikTok divest-or-ban law that “all you were doing was substituting concerns for Chinese propaganda, for concerns for US propaganda. That it was highly likely that if you force a sale and the sale is up to the approval of the president, it’s going to be sold to President’s lackeys.”

“I don’t see how it’d be good for users or for democracy, for TikTok to have an editorial policy that would make Trump happy,” Greene said.

If suddenly, the app were tweaked to push more MAGA content into more feeds, young users who are critical of Trump wouldn’t all be brainwashed, Literat said. They would adapt, perhaps eventually finding other apps for activism.

However, TikTok may be hard to leave behind at a time when other popular apps seem to carry their own threats of political suppression, she suggested. Beyond the video-editing features that made TikTok a behemoth of social media, perhaps the biggest sticking point keeping users glued to TikTok is “fundamentally social,” Literat said.

“TikTok is where their communities are, where they’ve built audiences, where the conversations they care about are happening,” Literat said.

Rather than a mass exodus, Literat expects that TikTok’s fate could be “gradual erosion” or “death by a thousand cuts,” as users “likely develop workarounds, shift to other platforms for political content while keeping TikTok for entertainment, or create coded languages and aesthetic strategies to evade detection.”

CNN reported that one TikTok user already found that she could finally post an anti-ICE video after claiming to be a “fashion influencer” and speaking in code throughout the video, which criticized ICE for detaining a 5-year-old named Liam Conejo Ramos.

“Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, which featured “a photo of Liam behind her,” CNN reported. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”

Short-term, Literat thinks that longtime TikTok users experiencing inconsistent moderation will continue testing boundaries, documenting issues, and critiquing the app. That discussion will perhaps chill more speech on the platform, possibly even affecting the overall content mix appearing in feeds.

Long-term, however, TikTok’s changes under US owners “could fundamentally reshape TikTok’s role in political discourse.”

“I wouldn’t be surprised, unfortunately, if it suffers the fate of Twitter/X,” Literat said.

Literat told Ars that her TikTok research was initially sparked by a desire to monitor the “kind of authentic political expression the platform once enabled.” She worries that because user trust is now “damaged,” TikTok will never be the same.

“The tragedy is that TikTok genuinely was a space where young people—especially those from marginalized communities—could shape political conversations in ways that felt authentic and powerful,” Literat said. “I’m sad to say, I think that’s been irretrievably broken.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address—which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list—is delivering scam spam.

The emails originate from no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, an address tied to Power BI. The Microsoft platform provides analytics and business intelligence from various sources that can be integrated into a single dashboard. Microsoft documentation says that the address is used to send subscription emails to mail-enabled security groups. To prevent spam filters from blocking the address, the company advises users to add it to allow lists.

According to an Ars reader, the address on Tuesday sent her an email claiming (falsely) that a $399 charge had been made to her. “It provided a phone number to call to dispute the transaction. A man who answered a call asking to cancel the sale directed me to download and install a remote access application, presumably so he could then take control of my Mac or Windows machine (Linux wasn’t allowed),” she said. The email, captured in the two screenshots below, looked like this:

Online searches returned a dozen or so accounts of other people reporting receiving the same email. Some of the spam was reported on Microsoft’s own website.

Sarah Sabotka, a threat researcher at security firm Proofpoint, said the scammers are abusing a Power Bi function that allows external email addresses to be added as subscribers for the Power Bi reports. The mention of the subscription is buried at the very bottom of the message, where it’s easy to miss. The researcher explained:

The abuse of a legitimate service, like Microsoft Power BI, adds an additional layer of credibility to the social engineering. The actual scam occurs during the voice interaction, which helps attackers evade traditional email-based detection and security controls. Further, attackers gain two advantages at once: the email is sent from a trusted Microsoft domain, and the lack of malicious links or attachments reduces the likelihood of automated filtering. While the emails originate from Microsoft infrastructure, the content and intent are fully controlled by the attacker via misuse of a legitimate feature.

Scammers have abused Microsoft Power Bi functionality in the past. Security firm Cofense reported in September that it found a spam campaign that transmitted phishing links that were hosted on the platform. Companies besides Microsoft that have experienced similar abuse include Google, according to Check Point. The security firm found a run of nearly 9,400 emails that were sent through the Google Cloud Application Integration platform.

A key detail that’s currently unknown is: Do users have to explicitly opt in to receiving emails from email addresses like no-reply-powerbi@microsoft.com, and can scammers send them to any external address automatically? A Microsoft representative said he’s looking into reports and didn’t have information immediately available. For more experienced Internet users, scams like this one are easy to spot. For others, scams that originate from a known sender with a clean reputation are more believable.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Supreme Court is taking up a case on whether Paramount violated the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by disclosing a user’s viewing history to Facebook. The case, Michael Salazar v. Paramount Global, hinges on the law’s definition of the word “consumer.”

Salazar filed a class action against Paramount in 2022, alleging that it “violated the VPPA by disclosing his personally identifiable information to Facebook without consent,” Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court said. Salazar had signed up for an online newsletter through 247Sports.com, a site owned by Paramount, and had to provide his email address in the process. Salazar then used 247Sports.com to view videos while logged in to his Facebook account.

“As a result, Paramount disclosed his personally identifiable information—including his Facebook ID and which videos he watched—to Facebook,” the petition said. “The disclosures occurred automatically because of the Facebook Pixel Paramount installed on its website. Facebook and Paramount then used this information to create and display targeted advertising, which increased their revenues.”

The 1988 law defines consumer as “any renter, purchaser, or subscriber of goods or services from a video tape service provider.” The phrase “video tape service provider” is defined to include providers of “prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials,” and thus arguably applies to more than just sellers of tapes.

The legal question for the Supreme Court “is whether the phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’ as used in the VPPA’s definition of ‘consumer,’ refers to all of a video tape service provider’s goods or services or only to its audiovisual goods or services,” Salazar’s petition said. The Supreme Court granted his petition to hear the case in a list of orders released yesterday.

The Facebook Pixel at the center of the lawsuit is now called the Meta Pixel. The Pixel is a piece of JavaScript code that can be added to a website to track visitors’ activity “and optimize your advertising performance,” as Meta describes it.

Salazar lost his case at a federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, and then lost an appeal at the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. (247Sports has its corporate address in Tennessee.) A three-judge panel of appeals court judges ruled 2–1 to uphold the district court ruling. The appeals court majority said:

The Video Privacy Protection Act—as the name suggests—arose out of a desire to protect personal privacy in the records of the rental, purchase, or delivery of “audio visual materials.” Spurred by the publication of Judge Robert Bork’s video rental history on the eve of his confirmation hearings, Congress imposed stiff penalties on any “video tape service provider” who discloses personal information that identifies one of their “consumers” as having requested specific “audio visual materials.”

This case is about what “goods or services” a person must rent, purchase, or subscribe to in order to qualify as a “consumer” under the Act. Is “goods or services” limited to audio-visual content—or does it extend to any and all products or services that a store could provide? Michael Salazar claims that his subscription to a 247Sports e-newsletter qualifies him as a “consumer.” But since he did not subscribe to “audio visual materials,” the district court held that he was not a “consumer” and dismissed the complaint. We agree and so AFFIRM.

Salazar’s petition to the Supreme Court alleged that the 6th Circuit ruling “imposes a limitation that appears nowhere in the relevant statutory text.” The 6th Circuit analysis “flout[s] the ordinary meaning of ‘goods or services,’” and “ignores that the VPPA broadly prohibits a video tape service provider—like Paramount here—from knowingly disclosing ‘personally identifiable information concerning any consumer of such provider,’” he told the Supreme Court.

The DC Circuit ruled the same way as the 6th Circuit in another case last year, but other appeals courts have ruled differently. The 7th Circuit held last year that “any purchase or subscription from a ‘video tape service provider’ satisfies the definition of ‘consumer,’ even if the thing purchased is clothing or the thing subscribed to is a newsletter.”

In Salazar v. National Basketball Association, which also involves Michael Salazar, the 2nd Circuit ruled in 2024 that Salazar was a consumer under the VPPA because the law’s “text, structure, and purpose compel the conclusion that that phrase is not limited to audiovisual ‘goods or services,’ and the NBA’s online newsletter falls within the plain meaning of that phrase.” The NBA petitioned the Supreme Court for review in hopes of overturning the 2nd Circuit ruling, but the petition to hear the case was denied in December.

Despite the NBA case being rejected by the high court, a circuit split can make a case ripe for Supreme Court review. “Put simply, the circuit courts have divided 2–2 over how to interpret the statutory phrase ‘goods or services from a video tape service provider,’” Salazar told the court. “As a result, there is a 2–2 circuit split concerning what it takes to become a ‘consumer’ under the VPPA.”

While Salazar sued both Paramount and the NBA, he said the Paramount case “is a superior vehicle for resolving this exceptionally important question.” The case against the NBA is still under appeal on a different legal issue and “has had multiple amended pleadings since the lower courts decided the question, meaning the Court could not answer the question based on the now-operative allegations,” his petition said. By contrast, the Paramount case has a final judgment, no ongoing proceedings, and “can be reviewed on the same record the lower courts considered.”

Paramount urged the court to decline Salazar’s petition. Despite the circuit split on the “consumer” question, Paramount said that Salazar’s claims would fail in the 2nd and 7th circuits for different reasons. Paramount argued that “computer code shared in targeted advertising does not qualify as ‘personally identifiable information,’” and that “247Sports is not a ‘video tape service provider’ in the first place.”

“247Sports does not rent, sell, or offer subscriptions to video tapes. Nor does it stream movies or shows,” Paramount said. “Rather, it is a sports news website with articles, photos, and video clips—and all of the content at issue in this case is available for free to anybody on the Internet. That is a completely different business from renting video cassette tapes. The VPPA does not address it.”

Paramount further argued that Salazar’s case isn’t a good vehicle to consider the “consumer” definition because his “complaint fails for multiple additional reasons that could complicate further review.”

Paramount wasn’t able to convince the Supreme Court that the case isn’t worth taking up, however. SCOTUSblog says that “the case will likely be scheduled for oral argument in the court’s 2026-27 term,” which begins in October 2026.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Terminally online right wing dorks are falling head over heels for an AI-generated waifu — and setting themselves up to get scammed in the process.

The damsel at the center of all their fawning is “Amelia,” who, we must stress, is not real. Nonetheless, she’s everywhere on places like X, where users ask Elon Musk’s AI Grok to imagine her as a purple-haired British schoolgirl — because of course she is — who’s also the anti-woke rebel of their dreams.

Often proudly displaying a Union Jack, Amelia does things like burn pictures of British PM Keir Starmer and rail against Islam and immigrants. She’s also been shown reading the notoriously racist book “The Turner Diaries” and proudly appearing alongside a sieg heiling comrade, flagrantly betraying white supremacist and neo-Nazi sympathies.

But where did “Amelia” come from? According to reporting from The Guardian, she was initially a spoof of a goth-looking character in a video game called “Pathways.” Funded by the UK government, the game was designed to be a classroom tool for teaching teenagers how to avoid falling into online extremism, but quickly became the target of mockery by far-right figures on social media.

The trend was heavily pushed by an anonymous right-wing account on X starting on January 9, according to an analysis by Peryton Intelligence shared with The Guardian. Since then, “Ameliaposting” has surged from 500 posts per day to over 10,000.

Of course, where there’s right wing outrage involved, there’s a grift. An account roleplaying as Amelia began pushing a new Amelia-branded cryptocurrency called $AMELIAJAK, which was retweeted, and thereby effectively endorsed, by Musk, The Guardian noted. (Musk, it’s worth mentioning, has a documented fondness for AI-generated women, with even his own followers mocking him for openly “gooning to AI anime.”) The meme coin reeks of a scam called a rug pull, in which followers are baited into buying the coin to boost its value, before the founder sells all their assets at a higher price. This causes its value to crash, leaving the duped fans with worthless currency.

Not all meme coins end up as being overt scams, but clearly someone intends to profit off of Amelia’s “fame.” And in any case, the coins’ value often collapses on their own, since they’re propped up by nothing except a fleeting moment of internet virality. Amelia may be out there owning the libs and destroying woke, but she’s also emptying the wallets of many far-right memelords who see her as the imaginary, wildly racist goth girlfriend that they never had — but wish they did.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Braving poor visibility, high winds, and frigid temperatures, a team of researchers has finally established a foothold on Antarctica’s fastest melting glacier.

According to the New York Times — which embedded with the polar expedition — 10 drilling personnel and roughly 17 tons of gear have been safely deposited on top of the Thwaites Glacier on Monday. Their goal is to plant scientific instruments into the rapidly-melting berg over the next few days, in order to observe, and hopefully better understand, its faster-than-expected disintegration.

During a rare break in the weather, the NYT says helicopters airlifted the researchers and their equipment 19 miles to their planned outpost site on top of the glacier. The two helicopters involved flew a dozen total loads of cargo from the icebreaker ship to the camp site, while glacial scientists and engineers erected a small tent city, complete with bathrooms, generators, and a mess hall.

The stakes are high. At worst, experts fear that the destruction of the Thwaites — evocatively known among scientists as the “Doomsday Glacier” — could have catastrophic effects on sea levels and coast lines around the world.

The camp is rudimentary: the bathrooms are described as simple outhouses drilled into the snow, while the dining tent boasts a basic air fryer and bread machine. Most food consists of “low-effort meals,” the NYT explains, like freeze-dried fajita bowls and premade soup that can be warmed up. Still, the team also has a cooler full of frozen meat and veggies, which had to be buried within the snow.

Because the ship that carried the team to Thwaites needs to embark on another trek in just a few weeks, the drilling team will need to vacate the glacier by February 7. Before they do, they hope to deposit monitoring equipment into the ocean water half a mile below their feet.

If they’re successful, scientists will be able to remotely collect temperature data on the ocean waters thought to be contributing to the thinning ice shelf. That data is important for glaciologists, who’ve watched in horror as the Thwaites melted at a rate of two or three times faster than expected over recent years.

“We’re very lucky to be here; we also work very hard to be here,” Scott Polfrey, a mechanical engineer at the British Antarctic Survey told the NYT. “It’s important for everybody here that we do things safely and we come home with hopefully some hard-hitting scientific results that speak about our planet.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No one is surprised that Neom — Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s $1.5 trillion-with-a-t plan to build a futuristic megacity smack dab in the middle of the desert — has turned out to be a disaster. Its centerpiece was supposed to be a towering skyscraper called The Line, over 100 miles in length, that could accommodate millions of people, something that the laws of reality always suggested would be impossible to pull off.

But, according to new reporting from the Financial Times, the saga may yet have a twist in store for us. The Saudi government is now considering drastically downsizing the linear city-skyscraper so it can instead turn Neom into a hub for — we swear we are not kidding — data centers.

It’s a proposal that reeks of a Saudi leadership desperate to find a way out of the multibillion dollar hole it’s dug for itself, as the dysfunctional monarchy rushes to follow what everyone else is doing and cash in on the AI race. But royal insiders briefed on the matter insist that, actually, it’s a testament to how flexible the Saudi government is.

“It shows that the system has a capacity to adjust its goals,” one of the people told the FT.

The pivot was proposed as Riyadh wraps up its year-long review of Neom’s progress, and continues a pattern of belt-tightening across the government’s myriad, exorbitantly expensive investments — which include everything from buying up entire sports leagues and teams to competitive video games. Ostensibly to diversify the country’s oil-dependent economy, they’re now becoming more burdensome as oil prices have been in steady decline, leaving the kingdom’s purportedly trillion dollar Public Investment Fund low on cash.

Jumping on the AI bandwagon, low hanging fruit as it is, could be lucrative for the Saudis. And according to the FT‘s source, Neom’s proximity to the Gulf of Aqaba makes it well suited for hosting data centers, even though seawater cooling is not the norm. “Data centers need water cooling and this is right on the coast so it will have seawater cooling,” the source said. “So it will be a major center for data centers.”

The extent that The Line will be downscaled remains unclear, but it apparently isn’t going away completely. The FT’s source said that architects were already working on redesigning the megastructure into a more “modest” — and radically changed — project.

“The Line will be a totally different concept. It will use the existing infrastructure in a totally different manner,” the person told the FT.

The linear city has been controversial since its conception due to its outrageous scale, exorbitant costs, and the human right abuses suffered by construction workers, with thousands believed to have died while working on the project. Now it could be facing its biggest reality check yet, though Neom has repeatedly denied previous reports suggesting it could be downsized.

As it stands, its fate hinges on the ongoing review, which is slated to finish by or near the end of the first quarter of this year.

            <h2>Google Staffers Terrified of ICE After Attempt to Force Entry Into Company Building</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While employees at some tech corporations are demanding their executives cancel government contracts on principle, workers at other companies are begging leadership to protect them from government raids and physical violence.

New bombshell reporting from Wired reveals that in the aftermath of the shooting of Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti, it came to light that at least one federal agent had tried to enter Google’s office in Cambridge, Massachusetts last fall.

In a response to internal concerns about what Google’s senior leadership was doing to keep its employees safe, the company’s head of security and risk operations reportedly said that an “officer arrived at reception without notice,” attempting to gain entry. Ultimately, the agent was “not granted entry because they did not have a warrant, and promptly left.”

Google didn’t respond to Wired‘s request for comment. According to the publication’s sources, the company’s core leadership, CEO Sundar Pichai and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, have been internally tight-lipped about Pretti’s killing. That stands in notable contrast to DeepMind’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, who’s taken taken a pointedly vocal stand.

“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote in response to a video of Pretti’s killing at the hands of six Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers over the weekend.

“Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera,” he continued. “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”

The excessive violence suffered by US citizens and non-citizens alike at the hands of ICE agents has put renewed urgency on calls to defund or abolish the agency, which was formed in 2003.

In response to the violence, more than 800 tech workers have signed onto an open letter calling on their companies to cut ties with ICE. At the time of writing, at least 100 of them referenced Google or its parent company, Alphabet, in their signature.

And with nationwide anti-ICE protests intensifying, silence is becoming an increasingly untenable position for tech giants like Google to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You do not, under any circumstances, gotta to “hand it” to Palantir, a company known for its AI surveillance and battlefield tech, and whose CEO Alex Karp has mused about legalizing war crimes.

But you have to admit, it’s pretty striking to hear that even some of the company’s own employees are starting to feel disgusted about ICE amid its brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, according to new reporting from Wired.

After federal agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, some Palantir employees began openly questioning the work the company was doing with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and Border Patrol, the immigration authorities deployed in Minneapolis and other American cities.

“In my opinion ICE are the bad guys. I am not proud that the company I enjoy so much working for is part of this,” one worker wrote in Slack thread  about Pretti’s killing. “Thinking pragmatically: is the reputational damage we’re taking for being associated with them worth it? What if the next administration will be democratic and they cut all the contracts with us?”

“We need an understanding of our involvement here,” another demanded.

The protests were raised in a company-wide Slack channel dedicated to discussing news items. And many of the posts that were either critical of ICE or questioned Palantir’s involvement with the agency received dozens of upvotes in the form of “+1” emojis, according to Wired, underscoring how the sentiment was far from being fringe, and that the unrest was out in the open. Some employees even wondered if Palantir could help put an end to what they were reading about in the news.

“Can Palantir put any pressure on ICE at all?” one employee wrote. “I’ve read stories of folks rounded up who were seeking asylum with no order to leave the country, no criminal record, and consistently check in with authorities. Literally no reason to be rounded up. Surely we aren’t helping do that?”

Palantir and ICE have deep ties. A 404 Media scoop from earlier this month, for example, described how Palantir was secretly providing ICE a tracking tool called “ELITE” to scour Medicaid data and other government sources to create a map of people it could potentially deport, generating a dossier for each person that included where they live. Palantir was also awarded a $30 million contract to build ICE an “ImmigrationOS” to provide “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the country, and also worked on updating the agency’s database so it could “complete target analysis of known populations.”

But according to Wired, Palantir has been so internally secretive about its work with ICE over the last year that employees have been relying on news reports to find out about the services their employer provides the agency.

Now, the groundswell of unrest within Palantir’s ranks has seemingly reached a point where it can’t be ignored by leadership. In response to the Slack protests, Palantir’s civil liberties team updated its internal wiki with a breakdown on its work with ICE, arguing that the “technology is making a difference in mitigating risks while enabling targeted outcomes,” per Wired.

Strikingly, the wiki acknowledged the widespread reports of ICE racially profiling and deporting citizens, as well as the “reputational risk” it was undertaking by continuing to work with the agency. But it insisted ICE remains “committed to avoiding the unlawful/unnecessary targeting, apprehension, and detention of US citizens wherever and however possible.”

This wasn’t enough to appease the concerned employees. They continued to grill their higher-ups about whether ICE could use Palantir’s tools for purposes not agreed in the company’s contracts, leading one executive to admit that Palantir doesn’t “take the position of policing the use of our platform for every workflow,” and hand-waved aside concerns of its tech being abused because there would always be “bad apples.”

One employee also confronted the same executive about a video of an ICE agent scanning an onlooker’s car and telling them they’ve been added to a “database” that marks them as a “domestic terrorist.” The employee demanded to know if Palantir was behind the database, which the executive denied.

The unrest at Palantir is the latest example of how the outrage over ICE’s actions in Minneapolis is crossing political lines, with even some DHS and immigration agents appalled over what’s happening in the city, journalist Ken Klippenstein reports. One ICE agent was exasperated how ten agents “couldn’t find a way to subdue” Pretti without lethal force, and mocked how it would be framed as a “justified killing.” “The best they can do is shoot the guy in the back?” he fumed.

A senior ICE officer also had some thoughts about Pretti’s death. “F*ck this,” he told the journalist.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration may govern for the billionaire class, but that doesn’t necessarily mean billionaires are enjoying the show. Far more likely is that they don’t have the guts to speak up.

Case in point: late on Saturday night, a group of American tech magnates descended on the White House for a private screening of the first lady’s documentary, “Melania.“

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the intimate gathering included a veritable who’s who of tech industry power players: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Zoom CEO Eric Yuan.

Vibes-wise, the event was classic Trump 2.0-chic. Guests were handed monogrammed buckets of popcorn, framed screening tickets for their trophy shelves, and a limited-edition copy of Trump’s 2024 book of the same title as her documentary, “Melania.“ Prior to the screening, the black-tie guests were greeted by a taxpayer-funded military band that playing famous movie themes, as well as “Melania’s Waltz,” featured in the documentary and composed by Hollywood’s Tony Neiman.

All of this is to say, it sounds like a galling display of power and fortune, at a time when American wealth inequality is the worst its been in nearly a century. And in a twist of context so extraordinary that it sounds fictional, the screening also came just a few hours after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who was attempting to help a woman off of the ground during an immigration raid in Minneapolis.

Yet for all their reach and access — literally — to the president’s palace, tech executives have been oddly reserved after leaving the screening, both in regard to the film as well as the shooting, whose victim Trump smeared as a “domestic terrorist.” Attempts to reach these powerful tech moguls since Saturday have all been ignored, CNN notes.

Maybe they were so overwhelmed by the artistry of the film — the production of which was plagued by extraordinary drama documented by Rolling Stone — that they’re literally speechless.

Far more likely: the documentary, which is already gearing up to be a massive flop, is such a train wreck that they fear that publicly pretending it was any good will subject them to public ridicule. And that’s not to mention the fierce backlash that following the decision to carry on with the screening after Pretti’s death, which tech execs won’t be in any hurry to call attention to.

And in the long-term, for CEOs who paid for front-row seats to this administration, speaking out against the Trump administration now would mean putting ethics ahead of earnings — a calculation nobody in their position would ever make.

            <div id="article-text">The acting head of U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA uploaded sensitive contracting documents marked “for official use only” to ChatGPT, according to Politico.

The outlet, citing officials, reported Tuesday that CISA’s acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, appointed by Trump, triggered multiple automated security warnings that are designed to prevent the theft or inadvertent disclosure of government files from federal networks.

Gottumukkala was reportedly granted an exception to use ChatGPT earlier in his tenure as CISA director at a time when other employees were prohibited. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA, sought to determine if there was any harm to government security as a result of his uploads.

Uploading unclassified but internal government documents to a public version of a large language model is problematic, as it allows the model to train itself on that information, potentially allowing its contents to be shared with others who use it.

A CISA spokesperson told Politico that Gottumukkala’s use of ChatGPT was “short-term and limited.”

Prior to his appointment at CISA, Gottumukkala served as the chief information officer of South Dakota under then-governor Kristi Noem. Following his appointment to CISA, Gottumukkala reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph, which Homeland Security later claimed was “unsanctioned,” and subsequently suspended six career staff from accessing classified information.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One way to track the speed of the AI boom is to follow the hardware supply chain. Nvidia is the classic example: As AI companies build out data centers, they’re buying up billions of dollars of GPUs each month, turning Nvidia into the most valuable company on earth. But Nvidia has suppliers too, and looking at them can give us an even longer-term view of the market.

That’s why we care about ASML, a Dutch photolithography company that has become a key linchpin for the semiconductor industry. ASML is the sole supplier of the EUV equipment needed to make cutting-edge chips, making it a central supplier for the entire industry. When ASML does well, it’s because companies are expecting to sell a lot of semiconductors.

And based on the quarterly earnings released Wednesday morning, the company is doing very well indeed.

The topline figure is 32.7 billion euros in net sales, which is a lot of money by any standards. But for our purposes, the most important figure is “new bookings,” which represent the new orders that came in this quarter. Looking at those orders tells us how much capacity chip manufacturers think they’ll need, based on the orders they expect from data center buildouts in the years to come.

By that metric, the AI infrastructure boom is still going strong. Last quarter, ASML brought in 13 billion euros worth of new orders, a new record for the company and more than double the orders that came in the quarter before.

In an earnings statement, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet made it clear the extra demand was coming from AI.

“In the last months, many of our customers have shared a notably more positive assessment of the medium-term market situation, primarily based on more robust expectations of the sustainability of AI-related demand,” Fouquet wrote. In non-CEO English, that means their customers expect AI labs will really need all the data centers they’re building, and they’re spending money now so they can be ready to supply the chips.

To be clear: none of this is guaranteed to happen. The future is unwritten! It may be years before all those orders are filled, and some clients may pull out before delivery time. The dreaded Zitron predictions could still come true and bring it all crashing down.

But if you were waiting for companies to back-pedal on the trillions of dollars in projected infrastructure spending…you may be waiting for a while.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the nuclear power gold rush enters into full swing — spurred by AI companies’ desperate need for electricity —  the sellers of “picks and shovels” are starting to cash in, too.

By the end of 2025, nuclear startups had raised $1.1 billion, all for small modular reactors. The deal flow is now extending to those critical suppliers in the nuclear industry. And Standard Nuclear, which makes nuclear fuel to feed those reactors, is one of them.

The company said it has raised $140 million in a Series A round led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Chevron Technology Ventures, Crucible Capital, Fundomo, StepStone Group, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, and XTX Ventures.

The round was completed in two tranches of $70 million each after Standard Nuclear hit milestones sooner than expected in the wake of President Donald Trump’s nuclear-related executive orders last year, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The new round comes seven months after Standard Nuclear emerged from “stealth” with $42 million in funding. Air quotes are required here; Standard Nuclear is built on the ashes of the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), which went bankrupt in October 2024. The bankrupt company had been working to commercialize a nuclear fuel called TRi-structural ISOtropic particle fuel, or TRISO, for years. Decisive Point’s founder, Thomas Hendrix, bought USNC’s fuel-related assets in the bankruptcy auction for $28 million.

TRISO fuel was originally conceptualized in the 1950s. Uranium particles about the size of a poppy seed are coated in ceramic and carbon. Those are then packed into larger spheres. Altogether, the design of the fuel pellets is supposed to be more resistant to melting down.

TRISO isn’t widely used today. And yet, many nuclear startups say they’ll be using TRISO in their reactors. Standard Nuclear has said it has $100 million in non-binding sales for 2027. Its customers include Radiant Energy, another Decisive Point portfolio company, and Nano Nuclear Energy, which bought USNC’s reactor assets.

Standard Nuclear’s years of experience could put it in the lead. But if nuclear startups can’t deliver large numbers of reactors on the timelines they’ve promised — they all face steep challenges in scaling manufacturing — Standard Nuclear could, just like its predecessor, find itself too far ahead of the puck.

The Microsoft-owned social network didn’t provide exact details on what users would need to do to qualify as proficient on the platform.

Once granted, certifications will appear on your LinkedIn profile alongside other professional skills.

LinkedIn plans to add more partners to the program in the coming months, including Gamma, GitHub, and Zapier. The platform is also inviting companies to register interest in being a partner in the new verified skills program.

“Jobs require fluency in the technology your employer depends on and AI proficiency; the ability to use these tools to deliver today is now the most in-demand skill. Today, trust matters more than ever. More than 100 million professionals have verified their identity on LinkedIn. Now, with the addition of verified skills, you can add an additional way to prove what you can actually do,” Hari Sirinivasan, VP of Product at LinkedIn, said in a statement.

According to a report by the learning platform eDX published last August, the number of job postings that required AI as a skill doubled in the trailing 12 months. A separate report from Indeed’s Hiring Lab echoed the same trend and noted that the number of U.S. job postings mentioning AI-related keywords rose to 4.2% by the end of 2025. The report mentioned that tech is still the most common sector where companies use AI-related words in postings, but other sectors like banking and marketing are also rising.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a chilly day before Christmas, Teresa Rivas helped a tween boy pick out a new winter coat. “Get the bigger one, the one with the waterproof layer, mijo,” she said, before helping him pull it onto his string-bean frame. Rivas provides guidance counseling at Owen Goodnight Middle School in San Marcos, Texas. She talks with students about their goals and helps if they’re struggling in class. She’s also a trained navigator placed there by a nonprofit called Communities in Schools.

The idea behind CIS and other “community school” programs is that students can’t succeed academically if they’re struggling at home. “Between kindergarten and 12th grade, kids spend only 20 percent of their time” in a classroom, Rob Watson, the executive director of the EdRedesign Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told me. If America wants kids to thrive, he said, it has to consider the 80 percent. Educators and school administrators in San Marcos, a low-income community south of Austin, agreed. “Tests and academics are very important,” Joe Mitchell, the principal of Goodnight Middle School, told me. “But they are secondary sometimes, given what these kids’ lives are like away from here.”

Along with mediating conflicts and doing test prep, Rivas helps kids’ families sign up for public benefits. She arranges for the nonprofit to cover rent payments. She sets up medical appointments, and keeps refrigerators and gas tanks full.

A new study demonstrates that such efforts have long-term effects. Benjamin Goldman, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell, and Jamie Gracie, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated data on more than 16 million Texas students over two decades, examining data from the Census Bureau and IRS, as well as state records on academic outcomes. They found that the introduction of CIS led to higher test scores, lower truancy rates, and fewer suspensions in Texas schools. The program bumped up high-school graduation rates by 5.2 percent and matriculation rates at two-year colleges by 9.1 percent. At age 27, students who had attended a CIS school earned $1,140 more a year than students who had not.

Jonathan Chait: Why the left stopped talking about achievement gaps

The program’s impact is “quite big,” Gracie told me: Spending $1,000 on CIS increased student earnings at age 27 by $400, whereas spending $1,000 on smaller class sizes increased student earnings by $40. The researchers estimated that every $3,000 in CIS investment would increase income-tax revenue by $7,000.

Although contemporary education policy has focused intently on standardized tests, student and teacher tracking, and other accountability measures, the CIS study suggests that the United States could bolster achievement by providing more social support too. “You could have the world’s greatest teacher,” Goldman told me. “It’s only going to matter so much if you’re not actually showing up to school.” Watson said he hoped the study would lead policy makers to finance community-school programs in every low-income neighborhood. “If you care about morals and social justice, there’s something here for you,” he said. “If you care about good fiscal and economic policy, there’s something here for you.”

But the country is veering in the other direction. The White House has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from a free-school-meal initiative, ended a $1 billion grant covering mental-health counseling, and revoked $170 million from the federal community-schools program, which helps cover the salaries of hundreds of workers like Rivas. Other whole-child initiatives might lose financing if they are found to fall under the Trump administration’s DEI rubric. At the same time, the White House is reducing financial support for low-income families, cutting more than $1 trillion from SNAP and Medicaid.

The United States wants schools to act as a “great equalizer,” yet socioeconomic differences among students remain the central drivers of student outcomes. Community schools can’t prevent homelessness, pay for health insurance, or stop parents from getting deported; they cannot construct a strong safety net. Still, they can help to close the gap.

A decade ago, the San Marcos school district’s dropout rate was higher than the state average, and its standardized-test scores lower. In 2016, Michael Cardona was named superintendent and tasked with a turnaround mission.

“We have great—amazing—kids,” Cardona told me. But more than 100 students were homeless in the 8,000-student district. “That’s a lot for a town with one high school,” he said. Seven students had died by suicide in recent years. Students had been involved in 282 recorded incidents of domestic violence over an 18-month period. “Typically, it was mom trying to discipline the kid or grandma trying to discipline the kid, taking away the cellphone, then the kid beats up the family member and gets put in jail,” Cardona said.

A visit to a fifth-grade gifted-and-talented classroom put the crisis into even sharper relief for him. Cardona asked the students a softball question: What could he do for them as superintendent? One asked if he could help keep their father out of prison. Another wondered if he could stop their mother from partying every weekend. Afterward, he sat in his truck and cried. “These are the students identified as the best of the best,” he said. “We’ve got a mental-health issue in this district unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”

Cardona decided to focus not only on test scores and remediation measures but also on social support. The district expanded its health-care and counseling initiatives, putting a focus on early intervention. And it reached out to CIS, which offered to place a navigator, such as Rivas, in every school.

CIS is a half century old and works with 2 million children in 26 states. (It’s not a pilot, in other words; it’s three times the size of Head Start.) The nonprofit has a few unusual qualities. For one, it doesn’t apply rigid criteria or means tests in determining who gets help, and doesn’t provide a set menu of benefits to students and families. The model is adaptable. In some districts, navigators focus on violence prevention or absenteeism. In San Marcos, they focus on behavioral health. Inside schools, CIS staff members created lamp-lit, womblike rooms, stocked with fidget toys and snacks, where kids can calm down and talk about their feelings. Some middle-school girls told me that Rivas helped them with “drama and stuff”—meaning “girls fighting over boys.” One boy who was having trouble sleeping and had a 69 average in math told me that Rivas was helping get his eyes shut and his grades up. “You only need one more point!” she said, beaming.

Idrees Kahloon: America is sliding toward illiteracy

CIS workers help families navigate existing public programs. “The traditional economist view would have been, Just give people cash. They’ll figure out what to do with it,” Goldman told me. But decades of studies have found that families in crisis don’t know that help is out there, possess limited capacity to research complex social-safety-net initiatives, and are averse to signing up for benefits, given the stigma. Community schools take paperwork away from stressed-out families and put it on trained employees.

CIS workers also come with a pool of funds to distribute. A freshman named Valencia Ayub told me about a time when her mother had lost a job at Dollar Tree, and her father had lost his job as an electrician. She considered going “straight to work” to help her younger sisters, rather than applying to college. CIS sent two checks, one for $500 and one for $800, to cover the family’s rent. School systems don’t have to make these payments themselves; in general, CIS is inexpensive for school districts to offer because it uses a mix of public, private, and philanthropic funding.

These kinds of wraparound supports keep kids in class, reduce the number of behavioral incidents, and make sure students are capable of learning when they sit down at their desks; as Goldman and Gracie’s study showed, they also have long-term effects. For those reasons, “there’s been a significant expansion in terms of systematic initiatives and interventions,” Anna Maier of the Learning Policy Institute told me; school districts, states, and individual institutions have built out their social-work capacity. Still, the country underinvests in kids and schools, creating achievement gaps that classroom teachers struggle to close and preventing children from reaching their full potential. The Trump administration’s withdrawing community-school financing as it slashes the safety net stands to make the problem worse.

In San Marcos, at least, the school district is seeing improvements. Kids feel safer, and the number of violent incidents has fallen. “At the end of the day,” Cardona told me, “that’s what I look at.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To hear some Silicon Valley insiders tell it, California is on the verge of economic suicide. This November, Californians will likely vote on a ballot initiative that would levy a one-off tax on the wealth of about 200 of the state’s richest residents. Garry Tan, the CEO of the start-up incubator Y Combinator, posted on X that the measure would “kill and eat the golden goose of technology startups in California.” Investors and tech executives are threatening to leave the state. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been angling for a centrist presidential pivot, has vowed to “do what I have to do” to stop the initiative.

Many progressives, however, see the billionaire tax as a long-overdue effort to finally force the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share. Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, calls it a “model that should be emulated throughout the country.” In their telling, hyperbolic claims about the death of innovation and entrepreneurship in California are a smoke screen for the fact that billionaires simply don’t want to pay higher taxes.

The unfortunate reality for progressive backers of the wealth tax is that what billionaires think about the policy, and how they react to it, will determine whether it succeeds. If voters approve the tax, they will be making a huge bet on billionaire psychology. That would be a very high-stakes wager indeed.

The California wealth-tax idea originated as a response to a federal tax cut. Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered taxes for corporations and rich individuals and paid for those cuts in part by reducing Medicaid spending. That left a roughly $20 billion annual shortfall in California’s health-care budget. If left unfilled, that could cause 1.6 million low-income Californians to lose their health care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In response, one of the state’s largest health-care-employee unions teamed up with a group of progressive economists and lawyers to come up with a way to make up the difference: impose a one-off 5 percent wealth tax on California’s billionaires.

The logic is simple enough: The ultra-wealthy, who amass their fortunes by owning assets as opposed to earning wages, pay very little in income taxes. According to calculations by the Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, who helped design the proposal, California’s billionaires pay approximately $3 billion to $4 billion a year in state income taxes, or less than 0.2 percent of their collective net worth of $2.2 trillion. He and the other architects of the ballot initiative determined that tapping into this pool of mostly untaxed wealth would be the most economically fair way to raise the money California needs, especially given that those same billionaires had just received a major tax break from Trump. “Right now our tax system effectively fails to tax the superrich,” Gabriel Zucman, another economist involved with the proposal, told me. “If you want to raise a lot of revenue, you need to focus on wealth.”

One serious objection to imposing a wealth tax at the state level is that it will trigger a process known as capital flight: When faced with the prospect of losing a sizable chunk of their fortune, wealthy individuals might leave the state altogether. If enough people make that choice, a wealth tax could backfire, resulting in lower long-term tax revenues. Many Silicon Valley critics of the ballot initiative have claimed that the proposal would give them virtually no choice but to leave. They say that it would result in massive tax bills that would force founders to sell off their companies, push entrepreneurs into bankruptcy, and ultimately make it impossible to build a successful company in California. “I think the technology industry kind of has to leave the state,” one anonymous venture capitalist told the tech-right publication Pirate Wires. “Because every person running a company will have to look at the math, and they will think, ‘Well obviously that cannot happen because it will literally destroy the company.’”

Already, several high-profile billionaires, including the Google co-founder Larry Page, the Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, and the Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, have reportedly begun shifting their assets out of California, and several have threatened to leave if the initiative passes. Andy Fang, a co-founder of DoorDash, claimed on X that the new tax “could wipe me out” and that it would be “irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state.” (Others, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, have said that they will remain in California regardless of what happens. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it. I’m perfectly fine with it,” Huang recently told Bloomberg.)

The tax’s designers, however, think they’ve come up with a clever solution to capital flight: a one-off tax that is retroactive, based on a billionaire’s residency status on January 1, 2026. In other words, unless they’ve already fled the state, billionaires won’t be able to move to avoid paying the tax. “At this point, there’s no financial incentive to leave California,” Zucman said. “You’re going to pay the same amount either way.”

Contrary to what its opponents claim, moreover, the tax is carefully designed to avoid the most common objections. If billionaires are worried that the government will improperly value their assets, they can submit independent third-party appraisals. If they can’t come up with the full 5 percent all at once, they can spread out payments over five years, though they would be charged interest. If their fortunes are tied up in “illiquid assets” such as a privately held start-up, they can defer the tax rather than having to sell their stake. “So many of these criticisms are either completely ignorant or made in bad faith,” Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley who helped write the bill, told me. “I think it’s pretty clear that these guys will basically say anything to protect their giant mountains of wealth.”

Brian Galle: The myth of the mobile millionaire

Even if the wealth tax wouldn’t nuke the state’s tech start-ups, however, it would roughly quadruple the amount that California’s billionaires currently pay annually in taxes. And if most empirical research suggests that the superrich do not tend to move in response to state-level tax hikes, none of that research has considered a tax nearly as large as what is being proposed in California. “There’s just a different kind of anxiety in the air this time,” Cristobal Young, a sociologist at Cornell University and the author of The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight, told me. “We’re not talking about paying a little more in income taxes. There’s a lot more at stake and a whole lot of unknowns.”

Part of that anxiety stems from the fact that billionaires don’t believe that the tax will really be one time only. “It’s not a one time; it’s a first time,” David Sacks, a venture capitalist and Trump’s AI czar, recently told CNBC. “And if they get away with it, there’ll be a second time and a third time.” That fear isn’t completely unfounded. In 2012, for instance, California voters approved a ballot initiative to raise the income-tax rate for high-earners for seven years to fill a budget shortfall. In 2016, voters overwhelmingly chose to extend the tax until 2030, and are likely to extend it even further. Voters could very well behave similarly with the wealth tax, especially given that the state’s budget problems probably won’t magically solve themselves in the next few years. “I just don’t think the idea that this will be one time is very credible,” Zachary Liscow, a tax scholar at Yale Law School who worked on a national wealth-tax proposal under the Biden administration, told me. “If this tax is really as successful at bringing in revenue as its proponents claim, I have a hard time imagining voters will just let it go away.”

This is where a debate ostensibly about economics reveals itself to be about political science and behavioral psychology. Proponents of the ballot initiative argue that Silicon Valley’s unmatched ecosystem of founders, investors, and talent is so alluring that no single tax would cause current and would-be billionaires to relocate. “Study after study has shown that the probability of becoming a billion-dollar company is higher in Silicon Valley than anywhere else,” Galle said. “You aren’t going to give that up just because there’s a chance that sometime in the future there’s going to be a tax on your wealth.”

Opponents of the bill, though, worry that the tax will be viewed as a harbinger of a soak-the-rich mentality among California voters that makes the state a risky place to do business. Start-ups and venture-capital investment could begin to flow to lower-tax states; the next hub of technological innovation may end up being seeded in Austin or Miami instead of Silicon Valley. “The real fear is less about the specific tax than the message it sends: that California is a dangerous place to be a billionaire,” Alan Auerbach, an economist at UC Berkeley, told me. “If people begin to fear that California has removed guardrails that allowed the wealthy to do well, they might get nervous and go elsewhere.”

Elias Wachtel: New York can’t be progressive without the one percent

Each side’s argument is rooted in a set of interlocking assumptions about how California voters will vote, how the state’s ultra-wealthy think they will vote, how those predictions will factor into would-be entrepreneurs’ decisions about where to locate their companies, and whether Silicon Valley will retain its unparalleled allure—all in response to a type of tax that has never been tried in the United States before.

For proponents of the proposal, going forward with the wealth tax is worth the risk, if only because the alternative is so much worse. Better to lose a handful of billionaires than for millions of low-income Californians to lose their health care. Other ways to generate the same revenue—such as raising income or corporate taxes, or cutting other parts of the budget—come with their own set of hard economic, political, and moral trade-offs. There is also a sense of basic fairness in asking society’s very wealthiest individuals, all of whom just got a massive tax break, to hand over a small portion of their staggering fortunes in order to help society’s least well-off.

And yet, doing so would mean wagering the future of California’s tax base on the proposition that billionaires are bluffing when they threaten to leave the state. Progressives tend to be clear-eyed about the lengths the rich will go to avoid paying their fair share. They should recognize a risky bet when they see one.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Iran’s 86-year-old supreme leader, who believes that he represents God’s will on Earth, ordered what now appears to be one of the deadliest two-day mass slaughters in modern history. According to estimates provided by two anonymous senior officials in the country’s ministry of health, as many as 30,000 citizens may have been killed during this 48-hour rampage on January 8 and 9. If these estimates prove correct, Ali Khamenei’s January 2026 massacre—the climax of a decades-long reign of repression—will rank among modern history’s deadliest single episodes of state violence.

Since the rise of the modern state in the 17th century, political legitimacy has come to rest on a social contract, in which the government provides security and sustenance in exchange for the consent of the governed. The Islamic Republic’s relationship with Iranians does not resemble a social contract, but a predatory lease signed in 1979 that has long since expired.

The terms of this lease—imposed by the landlord upon the tenants—are nonnegotiable:

You, the tenant, will live inside the religious fever dream of a man, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who viewed the state not as a vessel for national advancement, but as a weapon for personal retribution, and whose copious writings offered detailed pronouncements about the religious penalties for fornicating with animals, yet no insights on how to run a modern economy. “Economics,” he once said, “is for donkeys.”

You will be ruled for four decades by his successor, Khamenei, whose views will remain fixed no matter how much the world, and Iranian society, changes. He will preach resistance and pretend he is a pious man who eschews worldly wealth. But an entity called Setad—a shadowy financial empire under his personal control—has amassed assets valued at more than $95 billion in 2013 and potentially exceeding $200 billion today, much of it confiscated from Iranians who fled political and religious persecution.

We, the landlord, will micromanage your personal life. Whom you love, the movies you watch, the music you listen to, what you drink—all will be subject to our approval. Under our Sharia-based laws, women will be stoned for adultery, while men are permitted to take multiple wives.

You will be subjected to routine power outages, even though your country possesses the world’s third-largest proven reserves of oil and second-largest reserves of natural gas. We will preside over one of the highest inflation rates in the world, wiping out your savings as the national currency loses more than 99 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the revolution.

We will so profoundly mismanage our environment–due to corruption and incompetence–that we will dry up your rivers and turn your lakes into salt flats, creating dust storms that choke your cities. We will pump the groundwater until the land beneath Tehran literally sinks, imperiling its habitability for future generations.

Our national slogans will be “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” never “Long Live Iran.” As Khomeini once put it, “Patriots are useless to us. We need Muslims. Islam is opposed to patriotism.” While we chant these slogans, we will send our own children to study in the West.

We will treat half the population as second-class citizens. If you are a woman, your testimony in court will be worth half that of a man’s, and your inheritance will be half that of your brother’s. We will make a piece of cloth—the hijab—the primary symbol of our state’s authority, and we will beat you to death in detention centers for wearing it “improperly.”

Although we will rule from a moral pedestal, we will lie without reserve. As the longtime Khamenei adviser Mohammad-Javad Larijani likes to say, “Being able to keep a secret even if you have to mislead is considered a sign of maturity. It’s Persian wisdom. We don’t have to be ideal people. Everybody lies. Let’s be good liars.”

Our greatest national export will be the intelligence of our nation. We will suffer from one of the highest levels of brain drain in the world. One hundred fifty thousand of our citizens will leave every year, at a cost that even our own officials have conceded could amount to about $150 billion annually.

Rather than recruit the brightest minds from our diaspora back to Iran to contribute to our nation, we will take them hostage and sell them for ransom to the United States and European countries. We will take visiting foreign academics hostage and trade them for convicted terrorists.

Though we will boast about our independence, 90 percent of our oil exports—the lifeblood of our economy—will go to China, which demands steep discounts.

We will use a sizable portion of our national wealth—tens of billions of dollars—to finance and arm Arab militias throughout the Middle East. This should not be confused with concern for the well-being of Palestinians. In contrast to American, European, and Arab governments that fund Palestinian human-welfare initiatives, our resources will arm and finance Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Our goal is not to build Palestine but to destroy Israel. We will achieve neither.

We will spend well more than $500 billion—including the revenue lost to sanctions—for a nuclear program that provides neither energy nor deterrence, as was evidenced by Israel and America’s repeated penetration of Iranian air space.

We will ally with Russia, a country that excised a third of our territory in the 19th century, that occupied and attempted to take more territory in the 20th century, and that benefits from keeping our country isolated so that we cannot compete with them in global energy markets or for influence in Central Asia.

We will preach a “resistance economy” of austerity for you, while our Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps operates as a tax-exempt mafia that controls as much as 50 percent of the national economy, including telecommunications, ports, and construction. You will stand in line for subsidized bread while our elites smuggle iPhones and luxury cars through exclusive, unmonitored airport terminals. Our middlemen will funnel your national wealth into European property empires—buying ski resorts in Austria and mansions on London’s Billionaires’ Row—all while financing the very guards who repress you.

Omid Memarian: What Trump fails to grasp about Iran

We reserve the right to use you as human shields. When we fear an attack, we may refuse to close civilian airspace, shoot down a passenger plane full of our own citizens, lie about it for three days, and then torment the families of the victims.

If you protest our corruption or incompetence, you will be called a terrorist and charged with “waging war against God” or “corruption on earth.” We will execute you without due process, maintaining the world’s highest execution rate per capita.

We will build a digital wall around you. We will slow your internet speeds to a crawl and block global platforms to prevent you from communicating with one another or the outside world, while our officials post freely on X to spread propaganda to the West.

Even before this latest massacre, the gap between the Iranian government and its citizens was one of the widest on Earth. A critical mass of Iranians, including within the regime, have realized that the structure is condemned. They know that breaking the lease will be costly and terrifying, especially without foreign help. But they also know that living under its terms is at best a dead end, and at worst a death sentence. They do not seek to renegotiate the contract. They seek to evict the landlord.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/alex-pretti-shooting-trump-ice-minneapolis/685780/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The statements from congressional Republicans after Saturday’s shooting of Alex Pretti were relatively mild. Lawmakers said that they were “deeply troubled” or “disturbed” by the second killing of an American citizen by federal immigration officers this month; most called for an investigation into Pretti’s death. But the statements kept coming, one after another, all through the weekend and into yesterday.

The reactions from across the GOP sent an unmistakable message in their volume, if not in their rhetoric, to Donald Trump: Enough. The defining characteristics of the Republican-controlled Congress during the president’s second term have been silence and acquiescence. That so many in his party felt compelled to speak up after Pretti’s killing was a sign that Republicans had finally lost patience with federal agents occupying a major American city—a deportation operation that has soured the public on one of Trump’s signature policies and sunk the GOP’s standing at the outset of a crucial midterm-election year.

Republican committee chairs in both the House and the Senate summoned top administration officials to public hearings—a rarity in the past year. From the right, the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates criticized comments from senior law-enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, that blamed Pretti for carrying a firearm and said that people should not bring guns to public demonstrations. (Videos showed that officers disarmed Pretti before they fatally shot him.) Few Republican leaders rushed to defend the unnamed agent who’d killed Pretti, nor did they echo the rhetoric of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, who referred to Pretti, an ICU nurse, as a “would-be assassin.” In at least one case, the lack of comment from a top Republican was significant: House Speaker Mike Johnson—ordinarily quick to pick up talking points from the president and his top aides—has said nothing about the shooting.

The harshest Republican condemnation came from one of the party’s candidates for governor of Minnesota, Chris Madel, who yesterday declared that he was quitting the race in part because of the federal deployment. “I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said in his video announcement, “nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”

Watching all of this unfold was Trump, who already did not like what he saw. For the president, it was a rare winter weekend when he wasn’t in Palm Beach or at the golf course. He never left the White House. And he was glued to news coverage that showed little besides another horrific shooting in Minnesota. Videos of Pretti’s killing were inescapable on TV and social media, and the story broke through to nonpolitical media—drawing reactions from the likes of Charles Barkley and Bill Simmons—in ways that the fatal shooting of Renee Good on January 7 did not.

Trump’s first move was to defend the federal officers carrying out the immigration operations in the moments before the deadly clash. He reposted a Department of Homeland Security–supplied photo of the gun Pretti had been carrying, before again making claims about fraud in Minnesota’s immigrant communities. But he otherwise remained publicly silent as more videos of the shooting cast doubt on the administration’s statements about what had happened.

Trump began asking aides and outside advisers if it had been an “okay” shooting, trying to figure out whether the agents had made the right decision to fire, a White House official and two allies close to the West Wing told us. His top aides, among them Miller—including in a post that was amplified by Vice President Vance—immediately blamed Pretti for instigating violence (as the administration blamed Good after her death) and suggested, without evidence, that Pretti had been a “domestic terrorist.”

But this time, fewer Republicans joined the chorus. And as the weekend wore on, more GOP lawmakers and conservative media voices began to call for an investigation into the shooting and to question the administration’s assertion that an armed Pretti had violently resisted agents. Senator John Curtis of Utah called out Noem by name, saying that he disagreed with her “premature” response to the shooting.

Trump grew concerned at the response, the White House official and one outside ally told us. He again on Sunday demanded more cooperation from local officials and blamed Democratic lawmakers for violence in Minnesota—but he noticeably did not defend the officers who’d shot Pretti, in either his posts or in a brief interview with The Wall Street Journal. The president, who has long enjoyed near-total fealty from Republicans, took note of the lawmakers calling for a probe or quietly suggesting that federal officials roll back operations in the Twin Cities. (He was glad that the lawmakers did not blame him personally for the administration’s response, one of the allies told us.)

Trump was particularly bothered by the NRA’s strong reply to an assistant U.S. attorney in California appointed by the administration who said that if a person approaches law enforcement with a gun, there is a “high likelihood” that officers will be “legally justified in shooting you.” Trump has long prided himself on the support he receives from those he calls “my Second Amendment people,” and he has often been deferential to the gun lobby despite its waning influence.

When something becomes too controversial for Trump’s liking—or when the blowback becomes too fierce—he has in many cases found a way to declare some sort of victory, even a far-fetched one, and then move on (as he did with Greenland last week). Aides wondered whether he was trying to do the same with Minneapolis. Yesterday, Trump appointed his designated “border czar,” Tom Homan, to head the federal operation in Minnesota. Although most Democrats are deeply skeptical of Homan, he has not been involved in the Twin Cities operations and has been more consistently careful with his language than Miller or Noem. (After Good’s killing, Homan said that he would reserve judgment on the matter until an investigation had concluded.) Trump later claimed, after a phone call, that he and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are largely aligned in their goals for the federal operation—and even offered some faint praise for the governor, who is under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding the operation of immigration agents.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that if local officials increased their cooperation with the federal government, Border Patrol agents would “no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.” The administration decided to pull some federal agents out of Minnesota, aides said, but did not suggest a sweeping overhaul to the mission in the state or to Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

Trump’s unease, along with pushback from Republicans, grew by the hour and forced a major change: As The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff first reported, the administration yesterday ousted Gregory Bovino from his role as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” and removed him from Minnesota, where he had become the public face of the federal operation. Many in Trump’s orbit saw Bovino as an easy scapegoat; he’d claimed, without evidence, that Pretti had planned to attack federal agents. (His choice of coat and interactions with Minnesotans in social-media posts had also generated an uproar.) Despite this, a senior administration official insisted that Bovino’s transfer had been in the works before the announcement of Homan’s new role. Not all of Trump’s allies were happy with the change in Minneapolis. “You can’t sugarcoat this,” the Trump ally Steve Bannon said on his podcast. “It wasn’t just a blink. It was a crater.”

Last night, the president met for two hours in the Oval Office with Noem and one of her top advisers, the former Trump-campaign chief Corey Lewandowski, but the senior official made clear to us that no additional leadership changes are imminent. Leavitt, in her briefing, also said that Trump continues to have confidence in Noem. For the moment, she remains at her job.

            <h2>What Should Americans Do Now?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-protests-democracy/685778/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The killings in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have been compared to the murder of George Floyd, because they all happened within a few miles of one another, and because of the outrage they inspired. There’s an important difference, though: In 2020 the United States was in turmoil, but it was still a state of law. Floyd’s death was followed by investigation, trial, and verdict—by justice. The Minneapolis Police Department was held accountable and ultimately made to reform.

No one should expect justice for Good and Pretti. Today, nothing stands in the way of the brutal tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol. While President Trump seems to be trying to defuse the mayhem he’s caused by reassigning a top commander, he is not withdrawing the federal agents from the state or allowing local authorities to investigate, let alone prosecute, them for their actions.

Authoritarianism doesn’t disappear with the news cycle. The administration’s automatic lies about the killings and slander of the victims are less a cover-up of facts than a display of utter contempt for them. Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, FBI Director Kash Patel, and other top officials seem to invite incredulity as a way to flex their power: We say black is white. Agree or you’re a criminal. When Stephen Miller recently claimed that geopolitics is ruled by the “iron laws” of “strength” and “force,” he was expressing the administration’s approach to domestic governance as well. Those words are iron laws on American streets.

The prelude to the violence of January 7 and 24 came not in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, but in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021. Trump and his supporters were prevented from stealing an election and overthrowing the Constitution by democratic institutions—Congress, the courts, the police, the media, and public opinion. But the insurrection never ended. By the time Trump returned to power and pardoned the insurrectionists, almost half of the country believed that January 6 was a patriotic demonstration, a false-flag operation, or just no big deal. Throughout 2025, institutions that once restrained the presidency weakened or fell away one by one, until earlier this month Trump told The New York Times that the only limit to his power is his own mind. That same day, January 7, authoritarianism had its predictable consequence in freezing Minneapolis with the execution of Renee Good.

If rogue federal agents can shoot American citizens dead with total impunity, then it doesn’t matter whether state and local authorities, the courts, the media, the political opposition, and a mobilized public object. “ICE > MN,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media—an assertion of raw force, not constitutional authority. When Trump and his loyalists call protesters terrorists and warn that disobeying orders will get you killed, they strip away any illusion that the federal government respects the lives, let alone the rights, of those who oppose it—potentially half the population or more.

A lawless regime is an illegitimate one. If the country seems to have reached a breaking point in Minneapolis, this is why. And yet Minneapolis also offers a compelling answer to the question that democracy-loving Americans have asked for the past year: What can I do?

No historical precedent exists for where we are. Individuals and groups have often accused the U.S. government of denying their rights, and some of those accusations were irrefutable—as in the century between Appomattox and Selma, when the rights of Black Americans were denied throughout the South with the connivance of Washington. Some, though, were shams. In 1861, the Confederacy declared the government in Washington illegitimate and fired the first shots of the Civil War, not because any rights had been taken away from southern states—not even the right to hold human beings in bondage—but because they hated and feared Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. After the 2020 election, MAGA tried to claim that the election had been stolen and a Biden presidency would be illegitimate; truth and the law prevailed.

The federal government has never declared itself immune to the law and the Constitution while explicitly denying protection to peaceful opponents, until now. Many Americans who thought they were living under the rule of law feel paralyzed. The vague exhortation to “do something while you still can” creates a sense of urgency but doesn’t provide a plan. Rather than inspiring action, the question of what to do more likely leaves you feeling depressed and alone. Not even the prospect of waiting out the year until the midterms provides much reassurance. Trump has made it clear that he will try to undermine any election that might cost him some of his power.

Without a constructive answer, the danger is that Americans who find themselves without legal remedies will turn to illegal and violent ones. That would be a catastrophic mistake, both strategically and morally.

So far, action has come in the form of either legal challenge or protest, including speeches and writings by politicians and public figures, and the occasional nationwide demonstrations known as “No Kings,” which draw on patriotic imagery and the historic American aversion to tyranny. The key to the popularity of No Kings lies in its unifying name. The focus is not a single issue, such as abortion, immigration, Ukraine, or Gaza, but a broad stance against autocracy and for democracy. Its demonstrations are orderly, peaceful, good-tempered, and irreverent, featuring countless American flags. No Kings hasn’t been hijacked by leftist groups with more extreme agendas, spouting strident anti-American language that’s bound to repel ordinary people. But No Kings has been inconspicuous since October. It will have to transform itself into something much more potent than a once-a-quarter day of demonstration.

George Packer: Why the ‘No Kings’ protest moved me

In Minneapolis, as the scale and intensity of oppression increased, the answer to “What can I do?” evolved from protest to something riskier and more demanding: nonviolent resistance. As my colleague Robert Worth has reported, networks of Minneapolitans that had formed after Floyd’s murder to protect their neighborhoods from both out-of-control police and rioters have been revived in the past few months to protect their immigrant neighbors from the invasion of federal agents. Residents undergo training in nonviolent resistance, which demands courage, wisdom, and restraint; they bring food to those hiding at home, escort children to school, and stand watch outside; they blow whistles and send out alerts on encrypted chats to signal the presence of ICE vehicles, and follow them; they try to de-escalate confrontations (sometimes with the opposite result), provide medical aid to the injured, and shame masked agents in military gear who seem poorly trained and undisciplined compared with the civilians.

Given the level of rage on the streets, the conduct of these local networks has been remarkable. One older suburban woman—nothing like the “lunatics,” “domestic terrorists,” or “assassins” Trump and his advisers see in Minneapolis—told Worth that she doesn’t even consider her involvement political. Her preferred term for what she’s doing is humanist. It could be a byword for the whole opposition to a cruel and predatory regime.

Minneapolis is setting an example for the rest of the country: a nameless, leaderless, self-organized movement. Self-organization is a term I heard from almost everyone I met in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion. It’s an inherently hard form of activism, requiring high levels of motivation and trust. These obviously exist in the neighborhoods of South Minneapolis, where civic spirit and personal connections run deep. But replicating them on a wider scale—essentially, creating a mass movement for basic decency—raises obvious problems. That movement’s energy might depend on the arrival of conspicuous federal oppression in other blue cities and states (which Trump has promised). It would have to remain decentralized and maintain its local integrity while creating a capacity for nationwide coordination. It could fall apart for lack of discipline, coherence, trust, and leadership—or, conversely, because of leadership that devolves into factionalism. The civil-rights movement confronted all of these problems, and overcame them.

No Kings or another group could consider organizing and training people in other parts of the country to join the kind of civic action on display in Minneapolis—to move from protest to nonviolent resistance. Beyond neighbor-to-neighbor support in a moment of crisis lies a wide range of means to withhold cooperation from an illegitimate government. The late theorist Gene Sharp laid them out, along with ideas for strategic planning, in books such as From Dictatorship to Democracy and Waging Nonviolent Struggle. Sharp’s work has been used as an essential guide for democracy activists under dictatorial regimes in countries such as Serbia, Burma, and Iran. Americans should pick up these books and absorb their lessons.

Sharp analyzed various “methods of noncooperation”—political, economic, and social—that stop short of more aggressive disruptions. They include boycotts and strikes (such as the widely observed general strike in Minneapolis last Friday); refusal to participate in administration-supported organizations and events; “quasi-legal evasions and delays” and “reluctant and slow compliance” with government edicts; and finally, nonviolent civil disobedience. Anti-ICE actions that try to thwart the brutal and indiscriminate enforcement of immigration laws can become a form of civil disobedience.

Nonviolent struggle carries serious risks. It can lead to social ostracism, legal harassment, state intimidation, prison, injury, and, as we’ve seen in Minneapolis, death. One sign of the authoritarian depth to which the U.S. has sunk under Trump is that none of these risks is hard to imagine. Examples accumulate every day. A movement of resistance against an illegitimate regime has a chance of succeeding only if it remains strictly nonviolent and avoids the familiar trap of sectarianism. It has to be democratic, patriotic, and animated by a sense of basic decency that can attract ordinary people—your TV-watching mother, your apathetic teen, your child’s teacher, the retiree next door, the local grocer.

I keep asking myself whether it’s wise to even consider these things. I don’t want to sound alarmist, or delusional, or needlessly provocative. For an American who grew up in the postwar order with its apparently permanent rules, in a democracy with obvious flaws that nonetheless seemed on a course of gradual, inevitable progress, I find it extremely hard to assess the peril. I’m tempted to believe that the country will somehow return to normal, because I want it to be normal. We’ve never been here before, and either the nervous system overreacts or the imagination fails. After Minneapolis, I fear the latter more. Trump is taking the country on a path to tyranny. The first obligation for each of us is to see it and name it. The next is to figure out what to do about it.</div>

            <h2>A Reckoning for the Tech Right</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours after Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy showed up for a movie night at the White House. Along with other business executives and several prominent Donald Trump supporters, they attended a private screening of Melania, a new documentary about the president’s wife. The moviegoers were treated to buckets of popcorn and sugar cookies frosted with the first lady’s name.

Silicon Valley’s top executives have seemingly taken every opportunity to cozy up to Trump. During his inauguration a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, and Cook sat smiling behind the president in the Capitol Rotunda. The obsequiousness has not stopped since: In August, Cook presented Trump with a custom plaque atop a 24-karat-gold base in the Oval Office. At a White House dinner the next month, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin praised Trump’s “civil rights” work, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman described Trump’s leadership as a “refreshing change.” Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are among the companies that have made donations to fund the new White House ballroom.

Tech has a long history of making moves to appease politicians in power, including ample campaign donations. But the industry’s leaders have not distanced themselves from Trump even as his administration has shattered constitutional and democratic norms. In Minneapolis over the weekend, an American citizen was shot in the street by masked federal officers after recording them with his phone. In the immediate aftermath, top Trump-administration officials blamed Pretti for his own death, despite contradictory video evidence. The uproar has been loud, and not just among Democrats. So far, Silicon Valley’s top CEOs have largely remained silent.

Read: Billions of people in the palm of Trump’s hand

In some ways, tech’s rightward shift in 2024 was overstated. The embrace of Trump was mostly concentrated among a small pack of investors and executives, who had a quieting effect on the rest of the industry. In the past few days, the gulf between the top brass and the rank and file has grown. Hundreds of employees from major companies including Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, and beyond have signed a statement asking the industry’s CEOs to call the White House and comment publicly against the violence. Several well-respected voices in the industry have spoken up: “Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this,” Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, posted on X after the shooting. “The video was sickening to watch,” wrote the investor Vinod Khosla, who called out the administration’s “storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts.” Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, one of the few major Silicon Valley CEOs to have expressed his condemnation, took the opportunity to warn against the “reluctance of tech companies to criticize the US government.”

Altman reportedly rebuked the administration in an internal post to OpenAI employees, writing that “what’s happening with ICE is going too far.” He added that the president is “a very strong leader” who he hopes “will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Yet there is little reason to believe that Silicon Valley’s uppermost ranks will more formally break with Trump. If anything, as the midterm elections approach, some executives appear to be doubling down on their support. This fall, Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, and his wife, Anna, donated $25 million to Trump’s super PAC. And Elon Musk recently signaled his political return with a $10 million donation to the pro-Trump candidate running to succeed Mitch McConnell—the Tesla CEO’s largest-ever single contribution to a Senate candidate. (Jassy, Cook, and Greg Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic, has previously said that the Brockmans’ donations were made in a personal capacity.)

During Trump’s first term in office, a number of these tech leaders were outspoken in criticizing him: In 2017, Brin showed up to a protest against Trump’s Muslim ban, and Altman spoke with 100 Trump voters across the country to figure out what it would take to “convince them not to vote for him in the future.” Greg Brockman previously donated to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. It’s conceivable that these leaders’ political views changed, of course, but the groveling reads obviously as strategy. Trump is a dealmaker, and playing to his administration is good for business. Already, tech companies have gained a lot by cozying up to Trump, including relaxed AI regulation and tariff exemptions.

This all risks being a short-term, transactional game. In the long run, tech executives’ alignment with the president could easily backfire. “The Trump supporters in Silicon Valley are making the same mistake as all powerful people who back authoritarians,” the venture capitalist Michael Moritz warned in 2024. “They are, I suspect, seduced by the notion that because of their means, they will be able to control Trump.” But Trump is mercurial: He will do as he pleases. As tech executives continue schmoozing with the president, there are no guarantees that they will get anything in return.</div>

So UPS is now winding down that partnership, and presumably Amazon is either looking for another sucker, or cracking the whip on its own delivery drivers a bit harder.

Amazon is either looking for another suckerMany of the last-mile deliveries are managed by &quot;independent&quot; franchises that work only for Amazon. They were trying to sell one to a sucker a few years ago in my neck of the woods. As with all franchise models, you (the franchise &quot;owner&quot;) would invest the money, hire the drivers, purchase the Amazon vehicles, and then Amazon would dump the packages in a warehouse somewhere and you had to deliver them, and then Amazon would decide how much they wanted to pay you. Amazon claimed your annual profit would be $

Yes, you could help yourself to not attribute mistakes to malice. But it&#39;s more rewarding to find fault in others.

Amazon and their drivers do a pretty good job with delivery instructions. They deposit the packaged as requested snap a photo a leave.

Anything remotely difficult like please pace the item in the box at the end of my driveway, and UPS sticks a &#39;we are sorry we missed you&#39; sticker some place I won&#39;t find it for two days and demands I drive 30min each way to get my package.

won&#39;t be sorry to see Amazon take over the rest of their deliveries

In a world with very good window managers/compositors, they manage to have the crappiest freshman level window management.

Even Microsoft window management is better than Chrome&#39;s, and this seems to just carry forward that tradition of not even bothering to use a capable pre-existing solution and crap out a low quality one.

They can&#39;t use any of the existing WMs or compositors because they have their own display engine. But you&#39;re right, it&#39;s sad to see them fail so hard when they could just copy something that doesn&#39;t suck

It looks like they copied something that does suck.  All the behavior looks like Windows 11 but with the menu at the top of the display instead of the bottom.

I&#39;d assume that is absolutely deliberate too. I am sure goal is cannibalize the portable Windows market, further.

Yeah, it looks fine. Maybe the window borders could do with a bit more definition, but it&#39;s pre-release and they do seem to intend you to use it as a tiling window manager for the most part.

Yes, using the international English spelling within the codename.

Whenever I see &quot;inadvertent&quot; leaks of new UIs, functionality, etc., I can&#39;t help thinking that they might be purposeful trial balloons. I&#39;m sure companies want to see the people&#39;s surprised reactions, as opposed to the responses from those who have been waiting for the release of a new version.

Would not bother me at all if Aluminum ditched X for Wayland. X11 is an interesting kludge that has been &#39;made to work&#39; over the years. Mostly by taking advantage of various lax permissions, poorly defined functions, and tolerance of workarounds because, frankly, X did not want to be bothered with fixing much if it could avoid it. That&#39;s a good strategy for games and toys, bad strategy for industry standards.

I, for one, welcome our new window manager and compositor overlords.

Is this the same as this [slashdot.org]?  Or is this something different?  Or are we still in dupe mode?

Of course is will be, and rightly so. Those dumb-ass tariffs are hollowing out small businesses, that&#39;s why you do not see the impact on Wall Street. Small business do not list on Wall Street. Many of those businesses relied upon stuff from China which now costs more. Added to that, the steel and lumber tariffs that go into many goods the U.S. produces (and it still produces a lot) are raising the prices of finished goods. The export driven farm economy is going down because his dumbass tariffs have caused countries to buy elsewhere; the U.S. can no longer be trusted. la Presidenta could see something odd in his corn flakes some morning and decide a new round of tariffs are in order.

The fun doesn&#39;t stop there though. The domestic farm economy relies upon migrant labor, the migrant labor la Presidenta is scaring the hell out of and shipping off to anywhere he can stick them. You might have noticed the mass migration of Americans to take those jobs, should be happening any day now, really, just wait, it&#39;s coming.....and the pink unicorns are froliccing in the fields.....the white ones are attending Christian Nationalist rallies, at least the humans seem to see them.

And the dollar has been losing value because la Presidenta cannot stop trying to euthanize the Fed. Reserve, so demand for dollars is shrinking. It turns out foreign investors do not trust la Presidenta to not screw the pooch. Speaking of which, la Presidenta says he likes a weak dollar because &quot;you make more money&quot;. Whatever, it means that the regular proles will pay more for foreign goods of which the U.S. imports a lot. Ah, but then they&#39;ll be forced to buy American goods. Righto, at inflated prices because the reason they chose the foreign stuff was because it costs less. B....b.....but, then Americans will start new companies to replace the foreign goods. Maybe....in the fullness of time, but I doubt it. And if they do, they will still cost more than the foreign goods because those damn foreigners have been at a long time and know how to make them efficiently. And even if new American companies learn to make them efficiently, they only have to undercut the foreign competition on price by a little bit. The proles will still take it in the neck.

If you look at the jobs stats, then it is clear the economy is not generating jobs and is losing them. The coming LLM bots will cause more jobs to be lost. And if that doesn&#39;t pan out, then all that investment is lost. More pain either way.

And even if new American companies learn to make them efficiently, they only have to undercut the foreign competition on price by a little bit. The proles will still take it in the neck.If you look at the jobs statsThat&#39;s really the rub. Even if the manufacturing came back, which I agree it wouldn&#39;t, the jobs still wouldn&#39;t because automation has increased a hell of a lot over the last few decades. We could bring 100% of the manufacturing back and it wouldn&#39;t solve unemployment.

Usually I have been fairly dismissive that happenstance of economic swings one way or the other are blamed or credited to the current president.  Good or bad, democrat or republican.  There are policies with longer term implications that can set a broad tone, but the dramatic events tend to be associated with private sector happenings.

This time the administration chose to stomp on international trade, and that has real consequences. The dollar has taken a

Yeah this admin is paradigm breaking, we usually could not pin major economic movements on the Executive because they are not supposed to and historically have not involved themselves into such broad matters.

This admin though has decided they want to run anything and everything they can via the White House directly and Congressional Republicans, fully completing their transition into supplicant little worms, have decided Article I isn&#39;t really a thing, they have a king to make decisions for them now.

People are buying less, especially in the US, where tariffs and recurring budget-overruns/lockdowns and non-sensical tax policies put significant pressure on regular people. Add to that more and more optimization, bots and AI doing an increasing portion of physical and mental labor and you&#39;ve got the perfect storm of overall job-loss. Especially in Orgs such as Amazon that already bank on optimizing huge portions of the consumer-trade economy and have their sole purpose in doing exactly that.

You&#39;re not looking at this the right way.

It&#39;s likely the one you&#39;re being shown first will get them a bigger margin.

You wouldn&#39;t want to prioritize your needs before stockholder value.

Their search is intentionally shitty so you spend more time digging through random garbage. Google isn&#39;t any better because half the links are just your words regurgitated back into Amazon.

Oh their search works fine... for them, it&#39;s not really intended to work for the customer...

Of course, if you depend on your bot for anything of consequence for home automation, perhaps the concept of being dependent on internet access for it to function wouldn&#39;t be ideal.  A number of folks have a local version of home assistant for home automation that functions just fine without the internet.

I haven&#39;t looked at what this thing is but why can&#39;t it be run on ordinary PC hardware? Either CPU or GPU, nvidia, etc? Why a a Mac?FYI, cause I looked... It has a gateway component (IE: Server part) and companion apps (IE: the part that brings it to your device). It&#39;s all written in Typescript and runs on Node (node.js). The gateway runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux (maybe others?). They have a MacOS bar app companion, and mobile apps for iOS and Android. Windows and Linux companion apps are planned but don&#39;t exist yet - thus the push for a Mac (or at least that seems like the obvious reason).

When the article says local AI, I&#39;m thinking that the I runs on the Mac Mini(or other local hardware).

But, you interact with it through WhatsApp? It uses AI backends like ChatGPT and Claude? It does stuff on website APIs?

How is this local? It sounds like it&#39;s just a friont-end. What is it&#39;s use case that other AI solutions don&#39;t have? It seems like Ollama is more loacl than this.

It can run local models or (and most commonly) uses Anthropic/OpenAI api calls to their models.

If you have a high end mac mini you could probably do fairly well with local models.

Mac Mini is a popular device for local inference, as it has a built-in GPU which shares the system RAM, so you can run relatively large models for its price.

I assume Clawdbot/Moltbot can work with any inference backend with an OpenAI-compatible API, so it&#39;s up to the user to choose between local inference or using a subscription to someone else&#39;s LLM service.

What the value is of running an agent locally when all your data is in cloud services is a good question, but I guess it could also use self-hosted dat

This program is demanding absolutely precise and error free operation from something that do include an RNG generator.It&#39;s the epitome of not understanding the tech.

Just to be clear here, Moltbot does not run AI inference locally. You connect it to your standard AI services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc), which do the actual AI processing. What Moltbot does is connect those things to other things, like to Whatsapp.

In fact, even if you do have your own local inference engine running, like a llama model, Moltbot can&#39;t work with it currently. It ONLY works with the big AI services.

It really is just glue to connects things together, and is so lightweight it even runs on a Raspberr

Just to be clear here, Moltbot does not run AI inference locally. You connect it to your standard AI services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc), which do the actual AI processing.From the project page, the first point of pride is:Runs on Your MachineMac, Windows, or Linux. Anthropic, OpenAI, or local models. Private by default--your data stays yours.So no, that&#39;s only an option.

This is true, but that&#39;s because the summary says the exact opposite of what you&#39;re saying, and I suspect it&#39;s you, not the summary, that&#39;s right given that a &quot;useful&quot; spicy-autocomplete system generally requires more set up than &quot;Just install this easy to download package on a discarded Mac mini&quot;.

Since they know this one is coming and it&#39;s as near as hitting us anyway, this is a perfect opportunity to try out an asteroid defense system.

if we blow up the moon first, then the asteroid can&#39;t hit it

Altogether, it would be a once-in-a-generation chance to learn more about how the Moon/rocky worlds respond to powerful impacts. ...and would probably fuck up global climate for 30-odd years or so, until the seismic energy brought into the system dissipates. Either way, fun times :-D

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

The winds shifted this week after America watched Alex Pretti’s on-camera murder, on the heels of Renee Nicole Good’s on-camera murder, at the hands of Department of Homeland Security agents in Minnesota. Signs of cracks in the anti-immigrant right abound, from the alleged ouster of Greg Bovino from his role as “commander at large” of Customs and Border Protection to President Donald Trump’s TACO turn offering up an olive branch to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Republican luminaries who are usually content to deflect, attack, or ritually fellate the president in the wake of acts of lawlessness and violence have taken to the airwaves to condemn these public executions, with protests about them coming from the likes of Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, all of whom are demanding serious systemic changes in Trump’s immigration enforcement rampage. And gun rights groups have increasingly joined the chorus to contend that bringing a lawfully purchased gun out in public cannot be the basis for summary executions at the hands of federal officers. The CEOs of Target and other big corporations based in Minnesota seem to have unearthed something that looks to be a spine, calling for deescalation.

All credit—all of it—goes to the people on the ground in Minnesota; protesters, monitors, neighborhood patrols, independent journalists. As Robert F. Worth noted in the Atlantic, for all the MAGA talk of “domestic terrorists” and woke “assassins,” what’s emerged on the streets of Minneapolis is an organic, homegrown “meticulous urban choreography of civic protest,” a movement that is “leaderless” and “hyperlocal.” It has proven indomitable in the face of cosplay and photo ops and cartoon characters like Bovino and Kristi Noem. As Sherrilyn Ifill points out: “We all owe a debt of gratitude to the resilient and principled stance of the people of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota who have remained undeterred. They have fought for their neighbors and for themselves. They have stood in proud defense of their city, and their right to peacefully protest. The organizers on the ground have been extraordinary.” Adam Serwer calls it simply “neighborism.”

It’s going to be tempting to say that this week in Minnesota is the beginning of the end of something, but more likely it’s the beginning of something worse. Bovino and Noem in retreat is not the same as Trump and Stephen Miller in retreat, and there is genuine reason to fear that this moment of so-called symbolic compliance—a fleeting, symbolic retreat to stymy growing public resistance—will slow the roll of congressional inquiries, impeachment efforts directed at Noem, general strikes, and calls to defund ICE. Moreover, as Attorney General Pam Bondi’s not-so-subtle effort to extort voter information from Minnesota’s governor reveals, this cruel deportation dragnet is only half of the story; as ever, effort to undermine future elections is the goal. For every strategic Trump flinch and retreat, you can expect an equal and opposite effort to remain in power forever. With every threat of impeachment and accountability, the incentive to ensure a permanent MAGA majority forever ticks up, invisibly, but assuredly.

Which is why it is a mistake to think of these twin tragedies in Minneapolis as the horrific government actions that finally prompted shifts in politics, or law. Too much attention is always directed at opinion polling, craven political actors, and the levers of political change, and doubly so during this second Trump administration. This tendency to witness everything through the lens of “when will this be over for good” distracts from the real meaning of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, which is not how they died, but what they were doing when they were killed. This is what changed on the ground in Minnesota, and what needs to happen in Philadelphia and in Maine and in whatever blue city or state becomes the next target and the target after that. This transcends even the conversations about flipping the House in November. This is about what we are now learning, under immense pressure, and in real time, about authoritarian takeovers and how to resist.

For years we were told that voters didn’t care about protecting the Constitution or democracy, and they certainly didn’t vote on it. And certainly that appeared to be true in 2016 and again in 2024. But what we have seen spring up on the streets of Los Angeles and Portland and Minneapolis, and what we saw in the earliest No Kings marches, is that Americans actually care deeply about the law and the Constitution and democracy, and also—to borrow from testimony from Jack Smith last week—that those things have functioned so well in the United States and for so very long that many of us had come to take it for granted. For the last 15 years at least, after Citizens United, and Shelby County, and Dobbs, when audiences at speeches would ask me “What should I be doing?,” my responses tended to be carefully lawyerly and bloodless: court reform, gerrymandering reform, campaign finance reform. Repair and protect democracy and we could perhaps claw back its original sins as well as its distortions and degradations.

Well, it turns out it’s actually much more basic than that. What we are seeing amid the street protests, and the meal deliveries, and the marches and the legal observers and the calls for a general strike and for defunding DHS and impeachment for criminals, is actually all democracy work, and constitutional work, transmogrified and embodied into American streets and schools and small businesses. I was struck and moved by Robert Worth’s observation about what he witnessed in Minnesota: “Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution.” And if this is, in fact, the call, then what it might look like to answer it is no longer inchoate or mysterious. People are fighting and being assaulted and even murdered on their streets for the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the 14th Amendment … This is a clawing back of the Constitution, amendment by amendment, on the streets, and by the people.

Those of us who believed ourselves to be part of the Trump Resistance in 2016 made the mistake of naming it without quite knowing what it was. Pink hats and marches that felt like street fairs and witty signs were for social media. This version of the resistance swallows that whole—law enforcement officials want to shoot you, and you will be pepper-sprayed while you are restrained on the ground. As DHS efforts to occupy and terrorize cities morph and expand, this won’t be “protest” as we once understood it; it will be something far more frightening, something familiar to historians of racialized policing. Yes, it requires, even demands, new rules of engagement. Legal and civil disobedience training are now essential, and there will be ample work to do in protecting vulnerable neighbors and neighborhoods. It turns out that it was only hard to articulate what needed to be done to protect democracy and the Constitution until it needed doing. And now that we know what democracy emphatically does not look like—tyrannical cruelty as part of an all-out demand for mass submission to authority and the subordination of the “other”—it has, overnight, become simpler to name and understand the mission.

This is why the most dangerous days are almost certainly ahead, but it helps to know that the courts, and most of the lawyers, and the blue-city mayors and the blue-state attorneys general and the neighbors and the teachers and the religious leaders, already know in their bones which side they are on. Democracy will not defend itself, in much the same way that authoritarianism will not just pick up its nasty toys of wars and go home. There is a massive shift taking place that has to do with resisting state executions of lawful protesters but also has as much to do with fighting for the core values laid out by the same imperfect streetfighters who founded the country. It is indeed the stuff of nightmares, but this is what democracy must look like.

Now we can name the mission, which is no small thing. Focus on the mission and ignore spectacle and spin. Of the many, many things that Trump and MAGA have misunderstood, almost foremost among them was the belief that Americans would forever be more interested in consuming white-supremacist online content than in creating actual democratic freedom. From Chicago to Portland to Minneapolis to your town, when someone asks you what they should be doing, the answer must be: Protecting the Constitution.

            <div id="article-text">Anyone scanning the news might think it&#39;s pedal to the metal as far as AI agent implementations go, but there is a slump in rollouts as many organizations figure out what to do next, Redis CEO Rowan Trollope told The Register.

The company behind the Redis database, which built a following as a cache in cloud application architecture to become the most popular database on AWS, is trying to help users get out of the lab with AI agent projects and into production.

Earlier this month, Gartner forecast that investment from software vendors and cloud providers would propel a trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year as investment hits $2.52 trillion. Enterprise users, however, are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; as reactions to enterprise project pitches go from &quot;that was a great idea&quot; to &quot;where&#39;s my revenue?&quot; the research firm said.

Trollope said the phenomenon was reflected in his experience of helping customers build projects implementing AI agent platforms in business.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen fewer examples of real successful production agents than I would have imagined [in terms of] anything outside of engineering,&quot; he said. &quot;It is still quite hard to do, and only the biggest companies in the world understand this is the future they&#39;re investing in. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to stop. They realize they need to have this next-generation platform.&quot;

Redis started life in 2009 as an attempt to build a performant key-value database. By late 2020, it was the most popular choice as a cache and message broker in cloud-native application stacks. Redis has since broadened its ambitions, adding features for machine learning and support for JSON documents in a bid to evolve beyond its caching roots. Now it is supporting AI implementations. Last year, it announced LangCache, a fully managed REST service designed to reduce expensive and latency-prone calls to LLMs by caching previous responses to semantically similar queries.

While Gartner sees a lot of enterprise LLM spending going to large application vendors as users seek low-risk options by upgrading software they already use, Trollope said organizations need to think about the range of sources they have to draw from to get AI agents to make decisions.

While Salesforce might store what discount you gave a customer and Workday stores information about employees, agents making decisions may also require information from email, instant messaging platforms, and other sources, he argued. Hence, organizations building out AI agent systems were using frameworks from Microsoft, Google, or LangChain, an independent engineering platform for building, testing, and deploying reliable AI agents.

&quot;The information needed to make the most relevant decisions is often not immediately obvious to the agent,&quot; said Trollope. &quot;For example, if I were to build an agent that is going to interface with my customers and allow it to do pricing, why and when is the agent allowed to make exceptions to the standard pricing policy? If all you want is the standard pricing policy, that&#39;s very easy, but you&#39;re not going to replace any human beings with that. What you need is to find out where the humans apply their judgment and what data they used to make that decision. That&#39;s where pulling that data together is difficult, because it&#39;s often unstructured. It&#39;s sitting in Slack threads, in email chains, in text messages. That&#39;s what we see as the number one problem.&quot;

The data requirements for AI agents to make meaningful decisions are part of the motivation for vector features in databases. A slew of vendors, including Redis and Oracle, as well as specialist vendors, are backing the concept. With a paucity of successful case studies, the jury might still be out on whether returns will follow. But Redis, at least, sees big businesses continue to invest despite the challenges. ®

            <h2>Flush with cash, SK hynix spawns mysteriously named 'AI Co.'</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/sk_hynix_ai_co/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SK hynix is surfing the AI hype wave by setting up what it nebulously describes as a solutions biz to further exploit the hysteria.

The chipmaker is already flying high on the back of booming demand for datacenters. Its share price has quadrupled in the past year as it supplies a vital component, one now in tight supply. Judging by its financials published today, the AI gravy train isn&#39;t slowing.

The Korean corp is launching a new subsidiary in February, referred to only as &quot;AI Company&quot; (AI Co.) at this point. It aims to become &quot;a key partner&quot; in the AI datacenter ecosystem to &quot;proactively seize opportunities.&quot;

The market is now seeing demand for integrated AI solutions that combine hardware, software, and services rather than just standalone products, SK says.

The Register asked for more information, but a spokesperson told us: &quot;AI Co. aims to serve as an optimized AI solutions provider for various industries by investing in the AI datacenter ecosystem.&quot; The plan is to focus first on software for AI system optimization, then gradually expand investments within the ​​datacenter arena, we&#39;re told.

Investment in other companies and technologies is also part of the circular AI economy. SK hynix says that &quot;solutions commercialization&quot; is one of the proposed business activities too.

SK hynix says it is committing $10 billion to starting the new operation. An interim management team and a board of directors will be named next month.

Shipments of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) aimed at AI servers are forecast to triple by 2027, according to Counterpoint Research. Unit sales are estimated to exceed 15 million by 2028, surpassing shipments of the datacenter GPUs that currently dominate AI processing.

ASICs are generally used more for inference, and are cheaper than high-end GPUs in terms of operating costs, but may incur higher upfront costs. Broadcom is expected to take 60 percent market share in 2027.

It will establish the biz by restructuring Solidigm, the existing California-based SSD subsidiary. Solidigm will change its name to AI Co. before transferring SSD manufacturing operations to a new subsidiary named Solidigm Inc.

One of the aims seems to be to continue promoting the &quot;chip technologies such as HBM&quot; that have helped propel SK hynix into the AI hype cycle.

Memory demand is &quot;materially outpacing supply,&quot; according to analysts at IDC, with chipmakers reallocating production capacity to favor components for servers and GPUs rather than consumer devices as prices rise across the board.

The effect of the memory crisis can be seen in the Korean company&#39;s latest financial results, with revenue for 2025 up 47 percent to ₩97.14 trillion ($67.9 billion) and Q4 revenue up 66 percent on a year ago to ₩32.8 trillion ($22.9 billion)

It&#39;s also good news for Netherlands tech giant ASML, which develops photolithography machines needed for chip production. Its calendar Q4 revenue of €9.7 billion ($11.6 billion) came in toward the higher end of previous forecasts, but the firm expects demand for its most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems to increase significantly this year.

None of this, however, seems to be good news for end users who face paying significantly more for anything that incorporates memory, including PCs and smartphones as well as servers and GPUs. Analysts predict that PC shipments will fall this year simply because there won&#39;t be enough memory chips to go round and prices will jump as a result. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forty years ago, Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into its flight, killing its crew of seven and exposing the management culture and decision-making process that led NASA to launch on a freezing January day.

Four decades on, the technical facts that led to the destruction of Challenger are clear. Erosion had been noted in the rubber O-rings that sealed the segments of the twin solid rocket boosters (SRBs) mounted to either side of the Shuttle stack&#39;s external fuel tank. The temperature at launch was 36°F (15° colder than any previous launch).

Just after liftoff, the primary and secondary O-rings at the base of the right-hand SRB failed. The Rogers Commission report, an official investigation into the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, noted: &quot;At 0.678 seconds into the flight, photographic data show a strong puff of gray smoke was spurting from the vicinity of the aft field joint on the right Solid Rocket Booster.&quot;

More puffs were visible as the Shuttle accelerated. &quot;The vaporized material streaming from the joint indicated there was not complete sealing action within the joint.&quot;

During the flight, the Shuttle experienced several high-altitude wind shear events, all within design limits, but which caused the SRB steering system to be &quot;more active than on any previous flight.&quot;

At 58.788 second, a flickering flame was noted on the right SRB, at or near the aft field joint. That plume increased, and from approximately 62 seconds, the control system began to correct for the forces caused by the plume. This carried on for another nine seconds. At 64.66 seconds, the first visual indication that the flame had breached the External Tank was noted.

At approximately 72 seconds, a series of events happened in rapid succession. The lower strut linking the right SRB to the tank was severed, permitting it to rotate around the upper strut. A structural failure of the hydrogen tank occurred, releasing large amounts of liquid hydrogen and enveloping the Space Shuttle in a massive explosion.

The Shuttle was traveling at Mach 1.92 at an altitude of 46,000 feet. Its reaction control system ruptured, and the reddish-brown colors of the burning hypergolic fuel were visible on the edge of the main fireball. The Orbiter broke apart under severe aerodynamic loads, with several sections visible, including the forward fuselage and a mass of umbilical lines ripped from the payload bay.

The crew consisted of Dick Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. It was third time lucky for Jarvis after having to make way for US Senator Jake Garn in April 1985 and US Representative Bill Nelson in January 1986. Nelson&#39;s flight, STS-61-C, was the mission chronologically before.

In his book Riding Rockets, former astronaut Mike Mullane speculated on the fate of the crew. The cockpit had survived more or less intact, but all electrical power was lost at the moment of breakup. &quot;The mayhem of breakup lasted only a moment before the equally startling calm of free fall began.&quot;

The Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPs) for the pilot, Mike Smith, were activated, probably by Judy Resnik or Ellison Onizuka. &quot;Scobee and Smith were test pilots and reacted as they had been trained,&quot; wrote Mullane. &quot;They had faced countless serious emergencies in their flying careers. They knew the situation was perilous, but they were in a cockpit with a control stick, and there was a runway only twenty miles away. They believed they had a chance.&quot;

The cockpit, however, was electrically dead. No amount of button mashing or switch flicking could restore control to the blossoming cloud of debris that Challenger had become. The crew members on the upper deck had window views of the disaster as the cockpit tumbled over its arc. The three on the mid-deck – Ronald McNair, Christa McAuliffe, and Gregory Jarvis – were in a darkened, tumbling room, with no communication to inform them of events.

Investigators were not able to conclusively state that the crew was unconscious by the time the cockpit hit the ocean surface. At 207 mph and with a deceleration force of more than 200 g, it wasn&#39;t survivable. Unlike Mullane, former Apollo astronaut and chief of the Astronaut Office John Young reckoned that even with the activation of the PEAPs, the crew had only a few seconds of useful consciousness. Enough time to flick some switches, but not much more. He noted in his book Forever Young that the &quot;PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air that was not all that helpful at the altitude of the breakup.&quot;

The managerial and cultural factors behind the disaster are equally well documented. The Rogers Commission stated: &quot;The decision to launch the Challenger was flawed. Those who made that decision were unaware of the recent history of problems concerning the O-rings and the joint and were unaware of the initial written recommendation of the contractor advising against the launch at temperatures below 53 degrees Fahrenheit and the continuing opposition of the engineers at Thiokol after the management reversed its position.

&quot;They did not have a clear understanding of Rockwell&#39;s concern that it was not safe to launch because of ice on the pad. If the decision-makers had known all of the facts, it is highly unlikely that they would have decided to launch 51-L on January 28, 1986.&quot;

As John Young put it later, after summarizing the concerns of the Thiokol engineers, worries about the erosion noted on the O-rings, and the decision-making process that led to the launch: &quot;We astronauts would have thought differently.&quot;

The Challenger disaster reverberated through NASA in the years after, though not always loudly enough to prevent the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia. In the chapter &quot;Echoes of Challenger&quot; in their book Comm Check…, Michael Cabbage and William Harwood presented parallels between the last flights of Challenger and Columbia, as presented to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board [PDF].

Has NASA learned from the tragedies? It appears so, judging by the recent Starliner debacle, where caution and safety appeared to win the day in the decision to return the Boeing astronauts in a SpaceX capsule rather than risk a trip in Boeing&#39;s CST-100. However, there is also an argument that the astronauts should never have launched in the first place, considering the faults that were stacking up on the ground.

Today&#39;s anniversary is an important reminder for engineers to speak out when something doesn&#39;t look right, and for managers to listen.

There are many sources of information regarding the Challenger disaster. This article drew on Mike Mullane&#39;s Riding Rockets and John Young&#39;s Forever Young. The Rogers Commission report is also an invaluable source, as are Charles Perrow&#39;s Normal Accidents and David Harland and Ralph Lorenz&#39;s Space System Failures. ®

            <h2>Cops put Microsoft Copilot in holding cell after controversial hallucination</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/microsoft_copilot_wmp/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">West Midlands Police&#39;s acting Chief Constable has suspended use of Microsoft Copilot following a controversy that led to the early retirement of his predecessor over a recommendation to ban Israeli football fans from a Birmingham match.

The force&#39;s recommendation to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the team&#39;s Europa League match against Aston Villa on November 6 was partly based on material generated by the AI tool about disruption to a non-existent match against London club West Ham.

On January 6, former Chief Constable Craig Guildford told Parliament&#39;s Home Affairs Committee that his officers had not used AI to find this material, then corrected this in a letter to say they had.

Following criticism by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and others, Guildford retired at age 52. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said that he had already started the process that would allow him to fire Guildford when he announced his retirement.

The force&#39;s acting Chief Constable, Scott Green, speaking at a public meeting with Foster on January 27, said he could not discuss the details of how Copilot was used as this was under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct and West Midlands Police&#39;s professional standards department.

But Green added: &quot;On my first day in office, I took the immediate step to turn off access to Microsoft Copilot within the force. Like everybody else, we will be using AI in the future, we will use Microsoft Copilot, but we are not going to do so until I am satisfied with the conclusion of what has happened in this case and until we have got broader policy and guidelines in place.&quot;

Responding to a query from The Register, Foster said: &quot;Artificial intelligence has an important role to play in policing, to increase productivity, improve crime detection, and manage emerging threats. However, use of AI must be ethical, lawful, transparent, and evidence-based, so as to maintain the trust and confidence of the public.&quot;

&quot;Serious concerns have arisen about the use of Microsoft Copilot by West Midlands Police, when preparing to police the Aston Villa v Maccabi Tel Aviv football match in November 2025,&quot; Foster added. &quot;It is important therefore that West Midlands Police pause its use, whilst resolving matters relating to the governance, oversight and regulation of its use, as a matter of urgency.&quot;

In the meeting, Foster also questioned Green about poor record keeping of meetings with Dutch police and findings of confirmation bias in the force&#39;s assessment of the risk from Maccabi Tel Aviv fans. Green apologized for the way the force had handled the work, describing the failings as &quot;damning.&quot; He said the force is working to rebuild trust with Jewish communities by investigating every report of antisemitic hate crime and introducing antisemitism training for staff.

In a white paper published this week, the government laid out plans for a big increase in the use of AI in policing, spending £115 million over the next three years on a new National Centre for AI in Policing to be known as Police.AI that will initially focus on automating administrative work. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft patched a bevy of bugs that allowed bypasses of Windows Administrator Protection before the feature was made available earlier this month.

James Forshaw, security researcher at Google&#39;s Project Zero, reported nine vulnerabilities in December that could allow attackers to silently grant themselves admin privileges on machines with the new Windows feature enabled.

Most of these related to previously known User Account Control (UAC) issues, Forshaw said, but, if exploited, could have subverted the whole point of Windows Administrator Protection.

Microsoft has not yet opened up the feature for generally available builds – only Insider Canary users can tinker with it for now – but the idea behind it is to ensure that users only operate using the least privileges necessary.

A user can grant themselves admin privileges on the fly, but these are only granted in pre-approved circumstances and are revoked automatically as each process ends.

Forshaw said the most notable of the nine bugs he reported was a Logon Sessions flaw that relied upon five different Windows behaviors. He added that he likely only found it because he was previously familiar with the OS&#39;s &quot;weird behavior when creating the DOS device object directory.&quot;

The issue focuses on how Windows handles these directories for specific user sessions. Because the kernel creates a DOS device object directory on demand, rather than at login, it cannot check whether the user is an admin during the creation process.

Unlike UAC, Administrator Protection uses a hidden shadow admin account whose token handle can be returned by the system when calling the NtQueryInformationToken API function.

The researcher demonstrated that attackers can modify the token&#39;s owner security identifier to match their own user ID. Impersonating this token means that an attacker can force the kernel to create a new directory and assign ownership to them, effectively being able to control it.

Forshaw wrote: &quot;As access checking is disabled, the creation will still succeed; however, once it&#39;s created, the kernel will do an access check for the directory itself and will fail due to the identification token being impersonated.&quot;

Forshaw said he discovered this behavior in UAC some time ago, but never reported it as he could not find a scenario where a limited user could run code before any admin processes were created.

The introduction of Administrator Protection changed things because, unlike UAC, it creates a new unique logon session each time the user requests to elevate their privileges to admin level.

Further, due to a separate security mitigation Microsoft implemented to prevent C drive hijacking, the system service launching the process ignores the impersonated token&#39;s DOS device object directory. In this case, an attacker can exploit the bug, creating a DOS device object directory and redirecting the process&#39;s C drive, provided they can do it all before a process accesses a file.

Microsoft fixed this by preventing DOS device object directory creation when impersonating a shadow admin token at the identification level.

Forshaw said: &quot;This issue is interesting, not just because it allowed me to bypass the protection but also because it was a potential UAC bypass that I had known about for many years, but only became practically exploitable because of the introduction of this feature.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has published a novella-length essay about the risk of superintelligent AI, something that doesn&#39;t yet exist.

It&#39;s as good an advertisement as any for the summarization capabilities of the company&#39;s Claude model family as you can find.

tl;dr AI presents a serious risk and intervention is required to prevent disaster, though not so much that the regulations spoil the party. Go team.

The AI threat has been a talking point among tech cognoscenti for more than a decade, and longer than that if you count sci-fi alarmism. Rewind to 2014 when Elon Musk warned: &quot;With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon.&quot;

You can measure Musk&#39;s concern by his investment in xAI.

AI luminary Geoffrey Hinton offered a more convincing example of concern through his resignation from Google and the doubts he expressed about his life&#39;s work in machine learning. It&#39;s a message that recently inspired AI industry insiders to try to pop the AI bubble with poisoned data.

If you&#39;re concerned about this, you may find consolation in the fact that Amodei made a prediction that has not come to pass. In March 2025, he said: &quot;I think we&#39;ll be there in three to six months – where AI is writing 90 percent of the code.&quot; And in 12 months, he said, AI will essentially be writing all of the code. Spoiler: human developers still have jobs.

But the problem with Amodei&#39;s essay of almost 22,000 words is his insistence on framing the fraught state of the world in terms of AI. If you&#39;re a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If you&#39;re head of an AI company, it&#39;s AI everywhere, all the time.

If you&#39;re, say, on the streets of Minneapolis, or Tehran, or Kyiv, or Gaza, or Port-au-Prince, or any other area short on supplies or stability, AI probably isn&#39;t at the top of your list of threats. Nor will it be a year or three from now.

Amodei floats his cautionary tale on the back of this scenario:

Suppose a literal &quot;country of geniuses&quot; were to materialize somewhere in the world in ~2027. Imagine, say, 50 million people, all of whom are much more capable than any Nobel Prize winner, statesman, or technologist. The analogy is not perfect, because these geniuses could have an extremely wide range of motivations and behavior, from completely pliant and obedient, to strange and alien in their motivations. But sticking with the analogy for now, suppose you were the national security advisor of a major state, responsible for assessing and responding to the situation.

The analogy is not much better than the discredited Infinite Monkeys Theorem that posits a sufficient number of keyboard-equipped chimps would eventually produce the works of Shakespeare. Certainly 50 million brainiacs – proxies for AI models – could get up to some mischief, but the national security advisor of a major state has more plausible and present threats to consider.

If you look at the leading causes of mortality in 2023, AI doesn&#39;t show up. The dominant category is circulatory (e.g. heart disease) at 28.5 percent, followed by neoplasms (e.g. cancer) at 22.0 percent. External causes account for 7.0 percent of the total. That includes suicide, at 2.1 percent of the total, which is actually something that AI may make worse when people try to use it to manage mental health problems.

Polling company Ipsos conducts a monthly &quot;What Worries the World&quot; survey and it&#39;s not AI. When the biz last checked the global public pulse in September 2025, top concerns were: crime and violence (32 percent); inflation (30 percent); poverty and social inequity (29 percent); unemployment (28 percent); financial/political corruption (28 percent); and coronavirus (2 percent).

AI now plays a role in some of these concerns. Investment in AI datacenters has raised utility prices and led to a shortage of DRAM. The construction of these datacenters is increasing demand for water – though Amodei contends this isn&#39;t a real problem. High capex spending may be accompanied by layoffs as companies look for ways to compensate by cutting costs. And for some occupations, AI may be capable enough to automate some portion of job requirements.

But focusing on the danger and unpredictability of AI misses the point: it&#39;s people who allow this and it&#39;s people who can manage it. This is a debate about regulation, which is presently minimal.

We can choose how much AI costs by deciding whether creative work can be captured, laundered, and resold without compensation to those who created it. We can choose whether the government should subsidize the development of these models. We can impose liability on model makers when models can be used to generate sexual abuse material or when models make material errors. We can decide not to let AI models make nuclear launch decisions.

Amodei does identify some risks that are more pressing than the theorized legion of genius models. &quot;The thing to worry about is a level of wealth concentration that will break society,&quot; he writes, noting that Elon Musk&#39;s $700 billion net worth already exceeds the ~2 percent of GDP that John D. Rockefeller&#39;s wealth represented during the Gilded Age.

He makes that point amid speculation that the wealth generated by AI companies will lead to personal fortunes in the trillions, which is a possibility if the AI bubble doesn&#39;t collapse on itself.

But AI companies still have to prove they can turn a profit as open source models make headway. Anthropic isn&#39;t expected to become profitable until 2028. For OpenAI, profit is projected in 2030 if the company survives that long, after burning &quot;roughly 14 times as much cash as Anthropic,&quot; according to the Wall Street Journal.

Amodei&#39;s optimism about revenue potential aside, it&#39;s the money that matters. Those not blessed with Silicon Valley wealth may yet develop an aversion for billionaire-controlled tech platforms that steer public opinion and suppress regulation.

Let&#39;s not forget that much of the investment in AI followed from the belief that AI models will break Google&#39;s grip on search and advertising, which has persisted due to the lack of effective antitrust enforcement.

Amodei argues for a cautious path, one that focuses on denying China access to powerful chips.

&quot;I do see a path to a slight moderation in AI development that is compatible with a realist view of geopolitics,&quot; he writes. &quot;That path involves slowing down the march of autocracies towards powerful AI for a few years by denying them the resources they need to build it, namely chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.&quot;

His path avoids a more radical approach driven by the &quot;public backlash against AI&quot; that he says is brewing.

&quot;The most constructive thing we can do today is advocate for limited rules while we learn whether or not there is evidence to support stronger ones,&quot; Amodei argues.

That doesn&#39;t sound like someone worried about the AI demon. It sounds like every business leader who wants to minimize burdensome regulations.

The fact is no one wants superintelligent AI, which by definition would make unexpected decisions. Last year, when AI agents took up all the air in the room, the goal was to constrain behavior and make agents predictable and knowable, to make them subservient rather than independent, to prevent them from deleting all your files and posting your passwords on Reddit.

And if the reported slowdown in AI model advancement persists, we&#39;ll be free to focus on more pressing problems – like preventing billionaires from drowning democracy in a flood of AI-generated misinformation and slop. ®

            <div id="article-text">The ‘crisp and refreshing’ protein drink is a sign of a company running out of time to turn it around.

The ‘crisp and refreshing’ protein drink is a sign of a company running out of time to turn it around.

Beyond Meat just launched a new product that’s even further from meat than ever before: a protein soda. Beyond Immerse is the company’s first product that makes no attempt to replicate meat whatsoever, marking a sharp shift in Beyond’s business model. It might seem like it comes out of left field, but it all clicks into place once you know just how badly the veggie burger business is working out for Beyond. A pivot to protein is still a long shot for a company that’s never turned an annual profit — but it’s an attempt to tap into the one market left that might offer it hope.

Immerse is an oddity in and of itself. Unlike most protein drinks, which are usually chalky at best, it claims to be “crisp and refreshing” and comes in three fruity flavors: Peach Mango, Lemon Lime, and Orange Tangerine. Each flavor then comes in two versions, with either 10g or 20g of protein, at either 60 or 100 calories per 12oz can, with 7g of fiber either way.

As you’d expect from Beyond, Immerse is entirely plant-based. The protein comes from peas and the fiber from tapioca, with stevia, “natural flavors,” and a few juice concentrates and food colorings to round out the ingredient list. Beyond makes sure this ticks off a few more of the health food boxes, promising plenty of antioxidants and electrolytes too.

Immerse’s macronutrients are almost suspiciously impressive. I drink a protein shake most days, and 100 calories’ worth of my powder of choice would only net me 19g of protein and essentially no fiber at all, delivered in a semi-palatable sludge that I must try — and fail — to convince myself tastes like a milkshake. If Immerse can actually deliver better macros, and is as “crisp and invigorating” as Beyond promises, the appeal is obvious. Other people seem to agree. On the Beyond Test Kitchen site, where the limited first run of Immerse is exclusively available, every released flavor is already sold out.

Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising. Protein snacks, drinks, and supplements are a big and growing business. US sales of ready-made protein shakes grew 71 percent between 2021 and 2025, and they’re now an $8 billion market. Much of that protein comes from dairy-based whey, but plant-based protein is growing too — sales of both drinks and powders grew 11 percent from 2023 to 2024 according to the Good Food Institute, making up a $450 million business in its own right. Those numbers pale in comparison to the larger “functional drinks” market — prebiotics, probiotics, fiber, protein, electrolytes, preworkout, postworkout, CBD, and more — that was worth over $200 billion in 2024 and is only expected to grow from here. The drinks fridge in my local store is overflowing with gut-friendly kombucha, cold-pressed ginger shots, and electrolyte-packed recovery drinks from brands big and small, with more every time I look. Poppi, a prebiotic soda that touts the benefits of apple cider vinegar, has drawn investment from Shark Tank, spent millions to run Super Bowl ads two years in a row, and in 2025 was acquired by Pepsi for a cool $1.95 billion (it also settled a class action lawsuit alleging its “gut-healthy” claims were misleading, but hey, it can’t all be good news).

If there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit

You can see why Beyond wants in. It’s already got “pioneering expertise in unlocking the power of plants,” according to founder and CEO Ethan Brown, and is one of the few brands in plant-based food that can truly claim to be a household name. More to the point, protein drinks are clearly profitable — and if there’s one thing Beyond needs right now, it’s profit.

Beyond Meat was founded by Brown in 2009 and within a few years was generating excited headlines suggesting that the future of food was here. In 2019, Beyond went public; its shares launched at $25 each but rose to $65 on the first day of trading, making it the fastest-growing US IPO since Palm Inc. in 2000. A few months later shares peaked at just under $240 each, giving the company a valuation of over $14 billion. It secured supermarket distribution with Walmart, Target, and Kroger; supplied its fake meat to McDonald’s, KFC, and Subway.

But the glory days didn’t last long. Beyond has posted straight losses ever since it went public. Profit sometimes seems like an optional afterthought in modern capitalism, but if investors don’t see profit, they do expect to see growth, and that’s where Beyond has stalled: after a peak in 2021, Beyond’s annual revenue has steadily declined, down to $326 million in 2024. None of those fast food deals yielded permanent products on US menus. Beyond’s stock price has been in freefall for years, aside from a short-lived rally as a meme stock last October. It’s currently trading at below a dollar per share, placing it at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is facing a class action lawsuit from its own shareholders, who allege it hid the need for a $77.4 million write-down of aging assets.

What went wrong? While Beyond Meat’s management have no doubt made mistakes over the years, really it’s simply the highest profile victim of a collapse in the market for meatless meat. The Good Food Institute found that US plant-based meat sales had dropped 7 percent from 2023 to 2024, marking the third straight year of decline. “The category is smaller today than it was two years ago, four years ago, five years ago,” Peter McGuinness, the CEO of Beyond’s chief rival Impossible Foods, told New York earlier this month. “That’s not good.”

In fact Beyond and Impossible have arguably done well by surviving so long, but both are struggling. Impossible has never delivered on long-rumored plans for an IPO of its own, likely put off by Beyond’s public problems, but has suffered repeated rounds of layoffs; last year McGuinness told The Wall Street Journal that profitability was likely years away.

By 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier

Both companies sit at the nexus of two major trends that are working against them. The first is that meat is back on the menu. The Good Food Institute notes a 4 percent decline in sales of plant-based foods between 2023 and 2024, while the Food Industry Association found that meat sales grew almost 5 percent over the same period, to a record $105 billion. The number of vegetarians and vegans has declined, with Gallup’s 2023 Consumption Habits poll estimating 1 percent of the US population are vegan and 4 percent vegetarian, down from 3 percent and 5 percent in 2018. But vegetarians were never meant to be Beyond’s whole market — it was supposed to persuade swathes of the rest of us to eat less meat in favor of plant-based alternatives. For a while it seemed to be working — by 2023, nearly half of US restaurants offered vegan menu options, and cutting back on meat consumption, especially to reduce climate impact, was at the core of the cultural zeitgeist. But by 2025, only 22 percent of Americans were trying to reduce their meat intake, down from 37 percent three years earlier.

That would be bad enough for Beyond, but it has a second problem: processed food is out too. And a patty of pea protein, oils, and starches, pushed through an extruder and treated so that it will appear to bleed, is pretty darn processed. Researchers have linked ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to 32 different harmful health effects, The Lancet has labeled them a global health threat, and San Francisco is suing processed food giants. Then there’s RFK Jr., whose new dietary guidelines include perhaps the only part of current American health policy I could get behind, urging Americans to limit highly processed foods (and, in a double whammy for Beyond, to eat more meat). There’s no real evidence yet of a decline in sales of UPFs as a whole, but anyone trying to eat more healthily right now is unlikely to be recommended Beyond patties. Instead they might be told to eat whole foods, to stick to snacks with fewer than five ingredients, to eat more meat but maybe cut back on beef. Beyond doesn’t enter the picture.

This all goes some way to explaining why Beyond has turned for salvation in, of all things, soda. Next time you’re passing a supermarket drinks fridge, take a look at the “wellness drinks” on offer. You know two things they almost all have in common? They don’t include meat (I hope), and they’re pretty heavily processed. Health-conscious eaters don’t want their food to be made in a factory or packed with preservatives, but rarely seem to mind when it comes to what they drink. My Instagram feed is packed with fitfluencers promoting “clean” eating and whole foods, while they shill branded discount codes for processed protein powders. There’s a double standard at work that likely won’t last forever, but as long as it does, you can see why Beyond Meat wants to take full advantage.

It’s unlikely that a protein soda, no matter how refreshing or fiber-packed, will turn Beyond’s fortunes round entirely. But right now it doesn’t need that: it just needs time. Time to persuade investors to stick around, time to pull the share price up by a buck or two, and maybe just time for food fads to change once more and give meatless meat a second life.

﻿Fauna Robotics’ Sprout encourages human interactions with an expressive face and a soft foam body.

A startup called Fauna Robotics has revealed a new humanoid robot called Sprout it’s been developing over the past two years. Standing around 3.5-feet tall, Sprout’s design, featuring a soft padded exterior, a wide head, and expressive mechanical eyebrows, was inspired by some of science fiction’s friendlier robots like Baymax and Rosie Jetson, the startup’s co-founder and CEO, Rob Cochran, told the Associated Press.

With articulated limbs and grippers for hands, Sprout looks ready to tackle dishes, tidy up around the home, or join a factory assembly line alongside humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas. But that’s not why Fauna Robotics developed the humanoid. It’s initially being sold to other robot developers, researchers, universities, and tinkerers who may not have the resources to develop their own humanoid platform.

Fauna Robotics says Sprout’s “movement, perception, navigation, and expression all work out of the box,” so that others can focus on developing unique applications for the humanoid instead of having to spend time teaching it to do basic things like walk. While it may be destined for labs and research facilities away from the public at first, Sprout was still developed to be approachable and function alongside humans. It’s lightweight, quiet, and was designed with “no pinch points or sharp edges” for safety reasons. It’s not folding laundry yet, but the potential is there.

While buying a Sprout may be cheaper than engineering a humanoid scratch, it’s still priced at $50,000, according to the Associated Press. That puts it well out of the reach of most consumers, but some of the startup’s earliest customers include companies like Disney and Boston Dynamics. It’s not known how much robots like Atlas cost, but it will certainly be a lot cheaper for Sprout to take damage from a bad fall than Boston Dynamics’ most advanced humanoid.

            <div id="article-text">Somewhere between the Pixel and the Galaxy there’s a perfect foldable.

Somewhere between the Pixel and the Galaxy there’s a perfect foldable.

A book-style folding phone is a gadget that poses one radical idea: What if you always had a computer in your pocket?

When you’d like to be writing a blog while your plane is taking off, and large electronics (Computer) must be stowed? When you’re sitting on the couch putting together a grocery order, and Computer is in the other room? When your job is to write blog posts, but you weren’t allowed to bring Computer into the keynote venue? These are real scenarios in which I’ve used the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 over the past month.

Each offers a large inner screen that is, at a minimum, lots of space for watching videos, reading posts, whatever it is you normally do on your phone. But I’ve been pushing them into Computer territory lately, with largely excellent results. The experience has only made me more greedy; I’m now seeing the different strengths and weaknesses of the Z Fold 7 and the Pixel 10 Pro — and I’m convinced that the ideal foldable is smack in the middle.

The thing about gluing two phones together is that the resulting device usually weighs about as much as two phones glued together. That’s true of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which is heavy enough to constantly remind you that it’s in your pocket. But the 10 Pro Fold has a secret weapon: Qi2 with built-in magnets, which allows you to use it with magnetic Pop Socket-type holders. I carried it with Google’s Pixelsnap-branded ring grip, which helps mitigate the weight issue when you’re holding the phone for a while. It kinda works as a stand too, and shouldn’t a phone that’s also a tablet come with a way to prop it up? I’m starting to believe so the more I use these things.

The 10 Pro Fold has one more feature that influenced my decision to bring it on my family travels over the holidays and to CES in Las Vegas (a literal desert!): dust resistance. Any phone that’s going to be my daily driver needs to withstand the harsh environment at the bottom of my tote bag, where goldfish crackers go to crumble and die. It’s the only folding phone with a full IP68 rating for dust resistance, which gave me real peace of mind every time I threw it in a bag.

But after a few weeks of lugging it around, I was ready to trade the 10 Pro Fold in for something lighter. So I switched to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s superthin and light foldable. It weighs a little more than a standard slab phone, making it much more comfortable to carry and hold. It doesn’t seem like much on paper, but I promise you — it’s a difference you feel in a hundred tiny ways.

Something about adding even a thin case to the Z Fold 7 feels antithetical to its whole deal

Since you can’t have everything, the Z Fold 7 lacks full dust resistance (it’s only sealed against large particles), so I felt a little more nervous with it day-to-day. Also missing: integrated Qi2 magnets. Samsung offers a couple of low-profile cases that add a magnetic ring, but I’m not a case guy. And something about adding even a thin case to the Z Fold 7 feels antithetical to its whole deal.

Maybe that’s just my hangup, though I can’t help feeling that a simple ring stand that I could slap on the back of this phone is just what it needs. Prying a case off when I want to reap the full benefits of the Z Fold 7’s ridiculously slim profile feels needlessly fussy when a simpler option is right there. A stand would also address the wobble the camera bump causes when you use the phone on a flat surface; I’m always propping the phone up on a drink coaster to stabilize it. I realize a case would help here too, but please see my previous points about being allergic to cases and wanting to easily ditch the propping mechanism at will.

While I’m out here running my own fantasy phone draft, I have some thoughts about software, too. I like the simplicity of the Pixel’s Android implementation, but I prefer Samsung’s easy permissiveness when it comes to running multiple apps on the inner screen. I installed Gboard on the Z Fold 7 and uninstalled most of Samsung’s excessive preloaded apps, which has been a much more pleasant experience than the one you get out of the box.

I realize I sound like a real complainer here. “Woman is Dissatisfied with $2000 Phone” is not a revelation anybody needs right now. And yes, I know that tablets exist, and I do not want one in addition to the phone I already carry. So if you’ll indulge me for a minute, I’m being greedy here because I’ve seen so much potential in these devices over the past few months. Folding phones have been cool from the start, but I’ve never been so convinced about their real-world utility as I am now.

I wrote an entire blog post from the Pixel 10 Pro Fold on my way back from CES when my laptop refused to connect to airplane Wi-Fi, but the phone obliged. I ordered our weekly groceries with Amazon open in a tab on one side of the screen and my shopping list in Paprika on the other. I published a quick post to this website from inside the Sphere! Being able to get away with that on a device that’s also water- and dust-resistant, that’s slim enough to fit into my yoga pants pocket, that’s light enough to pass for a normal phone, with a handy magnetic grip that makes it comfortable to use all day? That’s the folding phone promise, folks. I just wish there were one device that could fulfill all of those wishes.

            <div id="article-text">The Wim S is here to teach other exoskeletons a lesson.

The Wim S is here to teach other exoskeletons a lesson.

Oops, I did it again: I wore an exoskeleton to the world’s biggest tech show, walking the streets and casinos of Las Vegas with a robot powering my legs. I don’t mean I briefly tried a new gadget there. I mean that for the second year in a row, robotic legs helped me walk the miles it takes to do my job at CES.

But this year, I found it easier — because a fanny pack was my exoskeleton of choice.

Exoskeletons aren’t just for military, construction, and hospitals anymore. There’s a growing category of stripped-down hip-, knee-, and ankle-mounted versions for leisure and rehabilitation. They don’t make us faster or stronger, but they keep people walking and hiking longer. They put pep in your step. And there’s no better place to test that robot-assisted future than a tech event in Vegas, where so many robots roam the halls that security won’t question why motors are strapped to my butt.

But with the $2,000 Wirobotics Wim S, which promised to reduce my exertion by up to 20 percent, those motors were instead clipped to my front. And though it might have been one more fashion faux pas to add to my long list of transgressions, that fanny pack design made a huge difference.

I always get asked how much faster you can run or how much more you can lift, but these aren’t robo-cheetah legs. None of these leisure and rehabilitation exoskeletons make you go faster or carry any more weight — though I can take longer strides for a longer time without tiring, which adds up to a speed difference. My feet got just as sore after miles of use, because they don’t take any weight off you, either.

But I wasn’t nearly as tired, because the motors help lift my legs up and cushion their impact. Wirobotics says that reduces your exertion by up to 20 percent, and I can feel it when I turn it off — the simple act of walking becomes noticeably harder, like gravity suddenly weighing me down. Power on, and you can last longer. “It was like I’d obtained an extra energy tank in a Metroid game,” is how I described the Hypershell last year.

Some exoskeletons can also reverse their motors to help you build strength and burn calories by adding extra resistance: the Wim S calls it “Aqua mode” since it’s like walking through water; with the Hypershell, it’s “Fitness Mode.”

The Hypershell Pro X I tested last year worked great when power walking Vegas, but it was a pain in the tail whenever I tried to sit down. Climbing into cabs, working on my laptop, or wearing a heavy backpack, the Hypershell’s big battery and rear crossbar naturally got shoved into my spine. I had to find backless chairs last year at restaurants and bars. Not anymore!

It also wasn’t easy to quickly take the Hypershell on and off and stow it in my backpack: while the 5.3-pound exoskeleton did fold, it was still roughly the size of a small briefcase and took a coordinated effort to sling around my body and strap it on.

The 3.6-pound Wirobotics Wim S is incredibly easy by comparison: so small, so light, so quick to attach, detach, fold and unfold, I once put it on while walking down a hallway in The Venetian hotel. It snaps reassuringly onto the mounting points on its padded belt, then onto its two leg straps. Detached, I can easily stow it in my backpack where it can charge off my USB-C battery bank at 30W (USB-C PD).

It’s a good thing I was able to remove and charge it on the go, though, because while it had more than enough power to pick up my feet, the battery let me down. On the second day, after walking around three miles, I got no warning before the power abruptly shut off.

At under 50Wh, it’s got less battery capacity than many gaming handhelds, let alone my 16-inch MacBook Pro. My test unit also had an incredibly unhelpful battery meter: when I checked the app throughout the day, it would sometimes say I had as little as 40 percent battery life left, then minutes later it would jump to 70 percent.

(Wirobotics’ original Wim offers swappable battery packs, but the more compact S model doesn’t, and it doesn’t fill me with confidence that the spec sheet suggests the battery is a consumable that needs to be replaced each year.)

One extra benefit of Wirobotics’ front-facing fanny pack design is that the leg-lifting arms rarely got in my way. Where the Hypershell and similar options have hip-hugging motors attached to fixed bars that wrap around my body, blocking easy access to pants pockets and keeping wider-bodied people from fitting inside, the Wirobotics can lift straight up using the motors already positioned in front of each leg.

The flat bars also made a decent laptop rest when I sat down to work, nice and level unlike my actual lap, though I’d probably want to cover them with a softer material to avoid metal sliding on metal. I also found the Wim’s joints, including a ball joint at each leg cuff and a telescoping joint that dynamically lengthens each arm as I walk, did a better job of following the natural motion of my legs.

I know fanny packs carry fashion stigma, but frankly the Wim was easier to hide, too, mostly because the fanny pack can tuck under my shirt. With the Hypershell, I had to hide it under a full jacket.

I’m sure there are downsides to this design that’d be more obvious to a mechanical engineer. The Wim’s tiny motors didn’t especially help me climb stairs, if you’re looking for that, though it does advertise a hiking mode. And I really hope whoever designs the next one of these spares a thought for people who need to wear normal belts — it’d be nice if the Wim could either hold up my pants (by the beltloops, perhaps?) or stop dragging them down in front. I wound up wearing my normal belt underneath.

But I can already see myself wearing a device very much like this in my old age. Or earlier, if I ever get into another accident and need to build up my walking abilities yet again. As for this one, Wirobotics put it on sale in Korea last year and is looking to expand into the US, Europe, and Japan — the company’s apparently already chatted with Best Buy.

Should I roleplay a cyborg again at next year’s CES?

Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple will absorb the cost of rising RAM prices.

Apple will try to avoid raising iPhone 18 prices “as much as possible” in the face of a global memory shortage, according to a report from supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to Kuo, Apple plans to “absorb the costs” of rising RAM prices, while at least keeping the iPhone 18’s starting price steady.

Kuo reports that Apple is now negotiating iPhone memory prices with suppliers every quarter, instead of every six months, and that he expects the company to face another price increase during its next round of discussions. The company plans to make up for the rising costs with its services business, which includes subscriptions to apps like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV, and others.

Kuo also points out that Apple may not just be dealing with a memory crunch, as other non-RAM components are running low due to suppliers prioritizing the booming AI business. Glass cloth, which several companies like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, use on printed circuit boards, is facing a bottleneck as AI companies buy up the same resource.

            <div id="article-text">Depending on how you look at it, Sam Raimi’s new horror-thriller can be a nightmare or a dream come true.﻿

Depending on how you look at it, Sam Raimi’s new horror-thriller can be a nightmare or a dream come true.﻿

When it comes to director Sam Raimi’s films, you have to go into the theater understanding that you’re about to experience a piece of cinema that vacillates between being absolute batshit and utterly sublime. Though Send Help is much more grounded than the projects he’s best known for, like The Evil Dead or Drag Me to Hell, it’s a quintessential Raimi film that makes no pretense of hiding how unhinged and disturbing its story is going to be.

On more than one occasion, Send Help almost feels like a live-action cartoon. Its heavy-handed foreshadowing and ridiculous set pieces are meant to leave you wincing in horror before making you laugh at how ridiculous they are. But for all of its outlandishness, there’s something deeply relatable about the conflict that sets Send Help into motion and message and the way it depicts the horrors of working for a terrible boss.

Though most of Send Help’s story unfolds on a glamorous, deserted island somewhere in the middle of the ocean, the movie opens in a joyless office where Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams) works as the head of planning and strategy. After dedicating years of her life to the company and saving it untold amounts of money with her expertise, Linda and one of her kinder coworkers, Franklin (Dennis Haysbert), know that she has been promised a much-deserved promotion by their boss. But when the company’s elderly CEO / founder unexpectedly dies and leaves the business to his boorish son Bradley (Dylan O’Brien), Linda is devastated to learn that the executive role that was meant for her has been given to an incompetent man who has only been working there for a few months.

While the news leaves Linda — a seemingly mild-mannered woman who reads like a riff on Batman Returns’ pre-transformation Selina Kyle — heartbroken, she is tenacious enough to confront Bradley about the situation and convince him to rethink his choices. He agrees to consider her for the gig if she accompanies him and a few other male executives on a work trip to their Bangkok office. During their flight on a small jet, it becomes clear to Linda that Bradley and his buddies are just stringing her along as a cruel joke. Linda is furious, but her rage quickly turns to desperate fear when the aircraft suffers a catastrophic malfunction and crash-lands into the ocean before sinking.

However terrifying you might think plane crashes are, Raimi’s approach to depicting that kind of accident is nothing short of breathtaking in the sense that it will leave you shocked and a little disoriented. The event gives Send Help a way of quickly (and humorously) thinning out its cast, but it also reveals novel things about its two leads. Washing up on an uninhabited island with no food or tools would immediately send most people into an existential doom spiral, but the situation is a dream come true for Linda, a longtime fan of the Survivor reality series. She sees her predicament as an opportunity to try out all of the things she has learned watching people compete on TV. And when Linda finds Bradley alive but badly injured further down the beach, she figures the two of them might as well keep each other company.

Though there is a whimsy to the way Send Help presents life on the island, the movie takes care to tease out the simmering tension that waxes and wanes between Linda and Bradley. It feels like Raimi wants you to lose track of how much time has passed since the plane crash, but you’re meant to see how being stuck pushes the two colleagues to become their truest selves. McAdams and O’Brien both lead with a delightful hamminess that makes their characters feel just short of being caricatures. As she begins to thrive in the elements, he becomes even more of a pompous asshole, and it takes a storm washing their camp away for the two to start seeing one another as allies.

While Send Help borrows a few notes from other island survival features like Castaway and The Blue Lagoon, you can feel Raimi teeing up a series of dark, Misery-adjacent twists that take this story in a markedly different and more stressful direction. As Linda and Bradley grow closer, their power dynamics repeatedly shift in unexpected ways, and the movie plays with your understanding of where the island’s true danger lies. What’s most unsettling is how hard it is to know whether the things the survivors tell each other about themselves are actually true. But Send Help’s final acts beautifully lay out all of the cards with an all-too-satisfying panache.

Though Send Help might not take you entirely by surprise, it’s a fun roller coaster of a film with a perfect understanding of when and how it needs to shift tones to be exciting. And if you’ve ever found yourself wondering what you might do if you were forced to survive alongside someone you hated, Send Help is more than worth the price of admission.

Send Help also stars Edyll Ismail, Xavier Samuel, Chris Pang, Thaneth Warakulnukroh, Emma Raimi, and Bruce Campbell. The movie hits theaters on January 30th.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/28/1131835/what-ai-remembers-about-you-is-privacys-next-frontier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year

Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.Although Google shuttered its high-profile internet balloon project Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

A startup’s ads for controversial embryo tests hit the New York City subway.

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.
