            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trumps-energy-secretary-orders-a-washington-state-coal-plant-to-remain-open/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SEATTLE—The last coal-fired power plant in Washington state was set to go cold at the end of the year. It would then switch to natural gas, cutting carbon emissions in half.

The shutdown had been in the works for 15 years and was mandated by state law. It required the Canadian energy company that owns the power plant, TransAlta, to retrain workers and ease the local community’s economic transition.

But the farewell to coal was canceled this week by the Trump administration. In furtherance of the president’s crusade to keep America’s coal plants burning, the Department of Energy announced Tuesday that an “emergency exists” in the Pacific Northwest “due to a shortage of electricity.” To keep the lights on, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the Centralia electric generating facility in southwest Washington must continue to burn coal for at least 90 more days.

“Issuance of this order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” said Wright, who issued a similar order last summer that blocked the planned retirement of an aging coal-fired plant in Michigan.

There is, however, no imminent shortage of electricity in Washington state or across the Pacific Northwest, according to state officials and regional energy experts.

“Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here,” said a joint statement by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, along with the state’s attorney general and ecology director. “The Trump administration has conveniently ignored the law and the facts. The TransAlta power plant is days away from completing its shutdown—a milestone the company and the state have been working toward since 2011. The workers have moved on. There’s no coal left to burn.”

The governor’s office and local environmental groups said they were examining the Trump administration order and may fight it in court. TransAlta said in a statement that it is “evaluating” the federal order but remains committed to a coal-to-gas conversion at the Centralia plant.

The year-end emergency that does exist in Washington state has been caused by record-setting rainfall and widespread flooding. (President Donald Trump has declared a federal emergency and authorized disaster assistance.) Thousands of people have been displaced and damage to major highways will take months to repair.

“It is so ironic, when we have a real emergency, that they picked this time to fabricate an energy emergency,” said KC Golden, a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, an interstate agency created by Congress to ensure reliable power while protecting the environment.

While there is no emergency electricity shortfall in the Pacific Northwest, the region, like much of the United States, does have a serious and worsening long-term electricity supply problem.

Washington and Oregon are home to about 100 data centers. Oregon is second only to Virginia in data center capacity, and the centers consume 11 percent of Oregon’s power supply, nearly three times the national average, according to the Sightline Institute, a Seattle think tank.

Energy use is rising along with the region’s booming high-tech economy, its outsized appetite for electric cars (The Seattle Times reported that 26 percent of new cars registered in Washington in October were EVs) and the climate-change-driven growth of home air-conditioning. The Northwest could face a 9-gigawatt shortfall of power by 2030, according to a recent utility-funded report by the energy consulting group E3. Nine gigawatts is roughly the electricity load of Oregon.

“We are facing a real energy supply challenge and we have been slow to take up that challenge,” said Golden, who represents Washington state on the Northwest power council.

The Pacific Northwest gets more of its power from hydroelectric dams than any other part of the country (60 percent in Washington), and the region has long been blessed with cheap electricity rates. But drought and changing weather patterns (less snow, more rain) have hammered the reliability of the system, which draws most of its power from big federal dams on the Columbia River, North America’s largest hydroelectric resource.

Grand Coulee Dam, the largest electricity producer in the United States, last year generated about half as much power as it did in 2012, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Power production in the Northwest and across the West fell to a 22-year low in 2022–2023, largely because of a years-long drought.

Making matters worse, the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that sells electricity from Columbia River dams and operates a high-voltage transmission system, has been exceedingly slow to connect new sources of power—wind and solar—to the grid. An investigation this year by ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting found that of 469 large renewable projects that applied to connect to Bonneville’s system since 2015, one was approved. Bonneville has said it is working to speed up the process. ProPublica also found that Oregon and Washington—while promising to eliminate fossil fuels from the grid—trailed most states in connecting large solar and wind projects.

“It takes too long to build new transmission,” said Lauren McCloy, utility and regulatory director of the NW Energy Coalition, an alliance of environmental groups, local utilities and local government agencies. “But we are all working on it.”

McCloy said that the entire Pacific Northwest is trying “to focus on how we can meet our clean energy goals and keep the lights on.” She added that in all the meetings she has attended in recent years, “I haven’t heard anyone in this region point to the [Centralia] coal plant as a solution to this challenge.”

Washington state codified its intention to move away from fossil fuels in 2019. The law mandates the closure this year of all coal-fired plants. It also requires carbon-neutral power production by 2030 and an electricity supply system that is free of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Mushrooming power demands of data centers, combined with halting integration of wind and solar into the grid, have raised questions about the state’s ability to enforce its law.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/instacart-agrees-to-refund-subscribers-60-million-in-ftc-settlement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart has agreed to pay out $60 million in subscriber refunds, the Federal Trade Commission announced on Thursday.

The refunds will help settle a lawsuit the FTC raised, accusing the grocery delivery app of engaging in “numerous unlawful tactics that harmed shoppers and raised the cost of grocery shopping for Americans.”

Under the settlement—which expires after 10 years—Instacart agreed to stop marketing its app with allegedly deceptive claims. That includes supposedly offering “free delivery,” when customers actually paid up to 15 percent in “service fees” not charged for pickup orders. Those service fees, the FTC alleged, were “just delivery fees by another name.”

Additionally, Instacart must cease claims that its services are “100 percent satisfaction guaranteed.” That claim implies that the company offers full refunds, but the FTC alleged that many customers were only offered “a small credit” for late deliveries or unprofessional services. Instacart also allegedly hid the refund option “from the ‘self-service’ menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, leading many consumers to erroneously believe they can receive only a credit toward a future order rather than a refund,” the FTC alleged in its complaint.

Instacart “pocketed tens of millions of dollars by failing to honor its promise of 100 percent consumer satisfaction,” the FTC alleged.

Refunds won’t be offered to customers allegedly harmed by those claims, but subscribers who were never told upfront that they’d be automatically charged after free trials will soon be repaid. The settlement stipulated that Instacart would transfer funds to the FTC within 14 days of the court’s approval of the deal.

In a blog post, Instacart emphasized that it has admitted no wrongdoing and elected to settle to “move forward.”

The app defended its “$0 delivery fees” claim by reminding customers that “we clearly and consistently distinguish delivery fees from service fees, which are always shown as a separate, itemized line.” Instacart also noted that subscribers receiving refunds were sent email reminders before renewals were charged. Further, any subscriber shocked by the charges had five days to request an automatic full refund if services were never used, the company said.

Boasting that Instacart has helped users save more than $3 billion “through deals, discounts, and loyalty programs,” the company estimated that users weren’t harmed by its practices and, on average, save $5 for each order.

“We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the agency, and we believe the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed,” the company said.

The FTC, however, alleged that “hundreds of thousands of consumers have been charged membership fees without receiving benefits from the membership or getting refunds.”

Defending Instacart users from an alleged “variety of deceptive tactics,” the FTC will now work with Instacart to retrieve customer information and issue refunds, a jointly filed order detailing the settlement said.

In its blog, Instacart repeatedly claimed to be transparent and clear with customers about charges. But in a sign that the settlement is already forcing changes, a claim that the company provides “one of the most transparent, customer-friendly subscription programs available, unlocking $0 delivery fees on grocery orders of $10 or more” was starred. At the bottom of the blog, the company clarified that “service and other fees apply.”</div>

            <h2>Strava puts popular “Year in Sport” recap behind an $80 paywall</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/strava-puts-popular-year-in-sport-recap-behind-an-80-paywall/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Strava, the popular fitness-tracking app, released its annual “Year in Sport” wrap-up—a cutesy, animated series of graphics summarizing each user’s athletic achievements.

But this year, for the first time, Strava made this feature available only to users with subscriptions ($80 per year), rather than making it free to everyone, as it had been historically since the review’s debut in 2016.

This decision has roiled numerous Strava users, particularly those who have relished the app’s social encouragement features. One Strava user in India, Shobhit Srivastava, “begged” Strava to “let the plebs see their Year in Sport too, please.” He later explained to Ars that having this little animated video is more than just a collection of raw numbers.

“When someone makes a video of you and your achievements and tells you that these are the people who stood right behind you, motivated you, cheered for you—that feeling is of great significance to me!” he said by email.

Strava spokesperson Chris Morris declined to answer Ars’ specific questions about why the decision to put Year in Sport behind a paywall was made now.

Other users feel that Strava is getting a bit too greedy. Dominik Sklyarov, an Estonian startup founder, wrote on X that Strava’s decision was a “money hungry move, really sad to see. Instead of shipping useful features for athletes, Strava just continues getting worse.”

Meanwhile, Reddit user “andrewthesailor” pointed out, “Well, they want me to pay to look at data I gave them (power, [heart rate] etc). And the subscription is not that cheap, especially when you consider that you are also paying with your data.”

Sana Ajani, a business student at the University of Chicago, told Ars that she used to be a premium member but isn’t anymore.

“I did notice the Year in Sport and was a little annoyed that I couldn’t unlock it,” she said in an email. “I would’ve expected some overall stats for everyone and extra stats for subscribers. Year in Review-type stuff is great content and distribution for most apps since everyone shares it on socials, so I’m surprised that Strava is limiting its reach by only letting paid subscribers see it.”

The San Francisco-based company, however, clearly sees things differently.

“Our goal was to give our users ample notice before the personalized Year In Sport was released,” Morris, the Strava spokesperson, wrote Ars in an emailed statement. “With the relaunch of our subscription this year, we wanted to clarify the core benefits of Strava—uploading activities, finding your community, sharing and giving kudos—remain as accessible as possible.”

Some Strava users have blamed financial pressures as the company’s monthly average user base has nearly tripled since 2020, reaching 50 million as of this year, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Per PitchBook, Strava’s rapid rise has only made the company more valuable; it now has an estimated valuation of around $2.2 billion as of May 2025.

CEO Michael Martin told the Financial Times in October that the company has an “intention to go public at some point.” “Growth profiles like ours… are particularly uncommon, especially at scale,” Martin added. “It attracts a lot of attention—especially from bankers.”

Some disappointed fans say restricting access to Year in Sport represents the latest in a series of company missteps dating back to at least 2023, when the company raised its annual subscription fee from $60 to $80. On top of that, last year, many Strava users thought the company’s foray into AI (or as Strava put it, “Athlete Intelligence”) was a bit of a miss. Earlier this year, Strava sued Garmin over alleged patent infringement—before promptly dropping the case less than a month later.

Still, at least one longtime user is now having second thoughts about Strava.

Matt Cook, 32, an amateur triathlete in Oakland, California, who has been active on Strava for a decade, told Ars that while he is a Strava Premium member, many of his friends are not. As such, that’s created some stratification and anxiety for him.

“It makes me not want to share [my Strava year-end results] because it feels like I’m flexing,” he said.</div>

            <h2>TikTok Accounts Are Using AI Slop to Sell Seeds to Plants That Don’t Exist</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/tiktok-ai-slop-seeds-plants-dont-exist">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are thousands of varieties of hosta — a leafy decorative plant that you’ve probably seen adorning outdoor spaces — being cultivated around the world, in a luxurious spread of colors, sizes, and textures. The hardy and easy-to-care-for plants thrive in the shade and can grow enormous leaves, making them a perfect project for amateur gardeners.

Yet despite the glorious natural biodiversity that already exists in the species, scammers on TikTok are using AI-generated slop videos to sell dubious seeds for hosta varieties that don’t exist.

A quick search for “hosta seeds” reveals countless videos of unnaturally colored hostas, from a fictitious variety featuring enormous, purple leaves, to “God’s rainbow,” a made-up plant that grows garish, rainbow-colored foliage, described as “so magical, your neighbors will think it isn’t real,” according to a robotic-sounding AI voiceover.

“It’s called midnight blue heart,” a voiceover says in a separate video. “A rare black and blue hosta that looks like it came from another planet.”

“It’s magical, it’s hardy, and only a few dollars,” the voice continues. “Tap the link below to order and bring the midnight blue heart home.”

The obvious hallmarks of half-baked AI are impossible to ignore, from water streams from garden hoses that flow straight through the foliage or miss the plant entirely to seeds that magically float by themselves while held in a hand. Many of the videos even claim their miraculous hostas can thrive even in snowy conditions, which is a nonsense prospect: hostas may be perennial, but aren’t very frost-tolerant and sustain damage from freezing temperatures.

The bizarre trend is part of a much larger deluge of AI slop drowning out human-authored content across social media platforms.

Author Bree Bridges noticed her TikTok feed becoming overwhelmed by the videos.

“TikTok has started giving me AI-generated garden content with videos of people supposedly growing plants that quite clearly look like they came from the ‘Avatar’ planet,” Bridges wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“And also they’re watering them indoors sometimes while watering the carpet and they grow in three days,” she added.

Experts have already warned that hosta lovers should stay far away from seeds that purport to grow into fantastical plants. Ads that New York-based NBC-affiliate WHEC showed to Bill Hegeman, co-president of the Genesee Valley Hosta Society, immediately raised red flags.

“Stop!” the TikTok account behind the outdoor living store Touch of Eco exclaimed in a recent clip. “If you see these colorful hosta seeds on TikTok, never buy them. These are fake, AI-generated.”

Even before the advent of generative AI, fake seeds were already a widespread scam on the internet. As YouTuber Atomic Shrimp explored in a video last year, seeds for made-up flowers like “cat face flowers” that inexplicably feature the faces of felines are being sold for considerable amounts of money.

On eBay, for instance, 50 seeds for a “cute cat face orchid” are being sold for $6.68. Poorly photoshopped or possibly AI-generated images show the faces of cats perched in the middle of fantastical plants.

During his investigation, Atomic Shrimp noticed that dodgy seed vendors were all using similar “cookie-cutter sites,” which are “probably very easy, cheap, and quick to deploy from a template.” The sites are also likely “acting as a front end for seedy, pun intended, drop shipping operations where the fulfilment, assuming there is such, is coming from the same sellers that list the same dodgy scam seeds for sale on Wish, AliExpress, Amazon, eBay, and other marketplaces.”

But instead of selling preposterously photoshopped seeds for “rainbow tomatoes,” scammers are using new tactics in a new age defined by AI slop.

One account on TikTok is even recycling the concept of a “cute cat orchid” by animating the images and turning them into a whole video.

Another video shows an adult cat’s face literally blinking its eyes as its disembodied head is reincarnated in the shape of a demonic orchid.

“How have 107 people bought this?” one TikTok account wrote in the comments.

“I can’t believe people actually fell for this,” another added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI powered robots are slowly making their way into our world, from delivery bots on wheels to caregiver bots for the planet’s growing elderly population.

Nothing has captured the imagination of investors quite like humanoid robots, though, as they’ve poured untold billions into the sector amid hype that bots shaped like humans stand to impact almost every part of society — particularly by replacing jobs everywhere from domestic labor to the factory floor.

But a venture capitalist is now issuing a warning: that the current surge of investment dollars toward humanoid robots has the makings of the next financial bubble. Despite all the viral robot dancing videos, she says, the reality is that there are still an imposing number of technical kinks to work out — and hence, startups in the space are a long way from generating profits.

“[I]nvestors should remain disciplined and back companies that have realistic goals based on economics, not hype,” said Daiva Rakauskaitė, partner and manager at Aneli Capital, a venture capital firm based in Lithuania, in a company statement. “From day one, startups should aim for early revenue streams through licensing, partnerships and have a clear model of monetization in the near future. The same revenue-first philosophy can be applied to any field.”

She’s not the only one sounding the alarm. China’s leading economic planner, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has warned that there’s a bubble forming around robotics and startups are making too similar robots from each other, which is inadvertently crowding out money for important research.

That’s on top of skepticism from robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks, inventor of the Roomba vacuum bot, who wrote earlier this year that all these investment dollars are a waste and humanoid robots are not safe enough to perform human tasks due to issues with hand dexterity and walking, among other lingering technical problems. In a nutshell, the gulf between what humanoid robots can do versus marketing hype is huge, Brooks said.

“We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he told The New York Times. (Underlining his warning: Roomba’s maker iRobot filed for bankruptcy this week.)

But we seem to be on a runaway train when it comes to humanoid robots, because “AI gives humanoids a commercial potential that was previously not possible,” the statement from Aneli reads.

In an October report from business analytics outfit CB Insights, the AI sector grabbed over 50 percent of more than $95 billion in venture capital funding in the third quarter of this year, while industrial humanoid robotic startups bagged 17 business deals.

But that report also warns about hype in the robotics space, saying it still faces “fundamental challenges with inference, dexterity, reliability, and cost, which limit initial use cases to structured environments like factories and warehouses with a controlled and predictable set of tasks.”

So what’s going to happen once the froth is gone: more humanoid robots dancing and working in factories — or junky vaporware bots collecting dust in our closets?

            <div id="article-text">Chinese robotics company Unitree’s G1 humanoid robot has taken over the internet by storm, from videos of it shooting hoops like an absolute boss to the more dubious viral fame that comes from being assaulted on camera by a livestreamer.

Its technical chops are beyond repute: the highly agile bipedal androids can perform gnarly kung fu moves and even take a direct dropkick without tumbling.

Now, the G1 robot has made its major stage debut by appearing alongside Chinese singer Wang Leehom during a Friday night concert in Chengdu, China.

Video footage shows an army of the robots dressed up in flashy outfits consisting of baggy pants and sparkling overshirts, pulling off some awfully convincing dance moves as theirmovements almost perfectly blend in with the human dancers accompanying Wang on stage.

At one point, several of the robots can even be seen performing a front flip in near-perfect unison.

It’s an impressive feat of coordination and programming, demonstrating once again how far humanoid robots, especially ones being developed in China, have come in a matter of years.

The concert was part of the Wang’s “Best Place Tour” and took place at the Chengdu Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium, which seats 18,000 spectators.

“The performance marked a rare example of a Robotic Dancer in concert, blending advanced technology with powerful live music,” the singer’s website boasts. “As the opening beats of ‘Open Fire’ filled the venue, robotic dancers appeared and moved in perfect synchronization with Wang Leehom’s choreography.”

“Many fans praised the performance as one of the most creative highlights of the Best Place Tour, showing how music and technology can merge seamlessly,” the website brags.

Indeed, the performance appears to have impressed many.

“Ok… robots in China are next level,” one observer tweeted. “They can do everything, even dancing like professionals!”

Besides being part of a high-budget stage performance, Unitree is looking to get all of its G1 robots dancing in people’s homes.

The company recently showed off a feature dubbed “Keep the Music Going, Keep the Dance Flowing,” which was “just developed in the past few days and hasn’t been rolled out to customers yet.”

The video shows the robot bobbing to a catchy disco beat — only to be pummeled with a soccer ball and smacked by a broomstick-wielding employee.

Others weren’t as amused by the demonstration.

“First we dance,” one user commented ominously, pasting a picture of the Terminator from James Cameron’s famed franchise. “Then you die.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Renowned AI scientist Yann LeCun confirmed on Thursday that he had launched a new startup — the worst-kept secret in the tech world — though he said he will not be running the new company as its CEO.

His startup is called Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) and has hired Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of medical transcription AI startup darling Nabla, as its CEO. Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a press release and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.

“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun wrote.

AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.

For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, was valued at $12 billion for its seed round last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.

LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, for his work on reinforcement learning.

The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.

Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, World Labs, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.

Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.

Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, including a $70 million Series C in June. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.

Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.

LeBrun said that Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community, is still growing well.

“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

            <h2>Netflix is betting on podcasts to become the new daytime talk show</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-is-betting-on-podcasts-to-become-the-new-daytime-talk-show/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you tune in to a podcast, you’re probably not opening the Netflix app — at least for now.

That might change, if Netflix gets its way. The streamer signed deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports this week, in addition to a recent deal with Spotify, to gain exclusive video rights to select shows. The company is also rumored to be in talks with SiriusXM.

Podcasters see this as an offensive move with YouTube as the primary target. And the data provides a convincing argument. According to YouTube, viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices (like TVs) in 2025, up from 400 million per month last year.

“As people begin to spend less time watching traditional television, and more time watching short form or low-cost, low-production value content on YouTube, that might present a long-term competitive threat to Netflix,” Matthew Dysart, an entertainment attorney and former head of podcast business affairs at Spotify, told TechCrunch.

While podcasters might understand the motivation, not everyone is convinced about Netflix’s move. Some podcasters told TechCrunch they’re not sure there is long-term value in video podcasts, while others are worried Netflix is contributing to a podcast bubble.

“They’re basically saying, ‘We want to be the king of content, and the only way we’re going to do that is if we take a swipe at YouTube,’” podcaster Ronald Young Jr. told TechCrunch. Still, Young Jr. thinks people are turning on video podcasts and letting them play in the background, noting that ESPN has been doing some version of this for much longer than we’ve been able to name it.

When independent podcasters Mike Schubert and Sequoia Simone launched their new show “Professional Talkers” this year, they noted the buzz around video podcasts and decided to start the new show as a video-first production on YouTube and Spotify.

“Neither of us had done video before, so we were like, ‘Why don’t we just start from the beginning and make this a video show?’” Schubert told TechCrunch.

Schubert found that his audience was ambivalent toward the video, perhaps because he has spent nearly a decade releasing audio podcasts, cultivating a fanbase that already enjoys and expects audio content.

“We posted an audio-only episode, and it did pretty similarly, numbers-wise,” he said. “So why would we put so much time and effort into the video and then run the risk of the episode being late when we can just do audio only?”

Young Jr. considered investing more energy into video, but decided against it — like Schubert and Simone, he realized that he built an audience that prefers listening to podcasts than viewing them.

“I’m like, ‘Well who am I pivoting for?’” he said. “And I realized that the pivot would be for advertisers, for podcast executives, and for people who think that video is the direction that everyone’s going.”

Still, there are some consumers who want to see video — even as a passive show to turn on in the background — as evidenced by YouTube’s staggering viewership stats.

Mikah Sargent, a podcast producer and host at TWiT.tv, works with shows like “This Week in Tech,” which have had a video component for more than 15 years. (Disclosure: I co-host a show at TWiT.tv once per month.)

“Something that I regularly hear from our listeners is … ‘you were my background when I was going through a rough time, or I needed to travel across the country, and having you there to listen to helped me pass the time,’” Sargent told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of passed time with podcasts. So Netflix can look at that and go, ‘Ooh, we get to have this thing that in some cases takes up more time and more streaming than you would get with a typical show.’”

There’s a disconnect between how creators and tech companies each think about podcasts. For people who make podcasts, a podcast can be a conversational show like the ones on YouTube, but it can also be a format that doesn’t translate seamlessly to video, like scripted fiction with sound design and voice actors, or the kind of reported, refined audio stories you’d find on NPR.

“I think this has to do with how squishy the word podcast is now,” podcaster Eric Silver told TechCrunch. “It means anything. It just means show now.”

For these independent creators, the corporate goings-on between Netflix and Spotify don’t immediately impact their day-to-day. But podcasters remember what happened when Spotify bought up and consolidated a significant chunk of the industry, created a bubble, then burst that same bubble itself. The impact reverberated across the industry with studio closures, layoffs, and a conception among onlookers that podcasting was “dead.” So when another Big Tech company comes waltzing into their industry, they’re skeptical.

“In any form of entertainment and media, when companies consolidate, the people who currently have power continue to get richer and richer than the industry underneath it,” Silver said. “The future gets more and more murky, and has less and less resources.”

Netflix isn’t making as extreme moves as Spotify. The latter company spent billions acquiring several tech startups and studios, allowing Spotify to control the entire process of making a podcast, from the recording software to the ad sales tools.

“I think that what Netflix is doing is a little bit more calculated than what Spotify did,” Young Jr. said. “Spotify blindly threw money at the top creators, and they kind of cratered the market in doing so, because the minute you value Joe Rogan at $250 million … you value them so highly that the regular podcaster is like, where do I fall on this?”

But what’s seen as an industry-changing infusion of money into the podcast industry isn’t actually that staggering for a company like Netflix, which is on track to make about $45 billion this year.

“Netflix and Spotify are similar in that way — aggressive moves to test a new value proposition by targeting top performers and spending money that ultimately is not that substantial from the perspective of a global tech platform, but is meaningful to the creator economy, to quickly learn if there’s a ‘there’ there,” Dysart said.

Netflix has only made deals with media companies thus far, rather than individual creators like Spotify did, but Dysart thinks Netflix’s investments are only beginning.

“I would expect Netflix to at some point go try to strike a nine-figure deal with a top podcast creator,” he added.  “I would also expect Netflix to take really big swings with very high-profile personalities on original podcasts.”

If Netflix gets its way, our culture will shift away from watching programmatic daytime TV and talk shows and toward watching podcasts.

“Back in the day, my mom would have a soap opera playing in the background while she was doing things, and I was definitely the person who would have ‘The Office’ playing in the background while I’m doing things,” Sargent said. “Now people get to have a podcast playing in the background while they’re doing things, and if Netflix can be the place where they go to do that, then I think it’s a win for the company.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-adds-new-teen-safety-rules-to-models-as-lawmakers-weigh-ai-standards-for-minors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In its latest effort to address growing concerns about AI’s impact on young people, OpenAI on Thursday updated its guidelines for how its AI models should behave with users under 18, and published new AI literacy resources for teens and parents. Still, questions remain about how consistently such policies will translate into practice.

The updates come as the AI industry generally, and OpenAI in particular, faces increased scrutiny from policymakers, educators, and child-safety advocates after several teenagers allegedly died by suicide after prolonged conversations with AI chatbots.

Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012, are the most active users of OpenAI’s chatbot. And following OpenAI’s recent deal with Disney, more young people may flock to the platform, which lets you do everything from ask for help with homework to generate images and videos on thousands of topics.

Last week, 42 state attorneys general signed a letter to Big Tech companies, urging them to implement safeguards on AI chatbots to protect children and vulnerable people. And as the Trump administration works out what the federal standard on AI regulation might look like, policymakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have introduced legislation that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots altogether.

OpenAI’s updated Model Spec, which lays out behavior guidelines for its large language models, builds on existing specifications that prohibit the models from generating sexual content involving minors, or encouraging self-harm, delusions, or mania. This would work together with an upcoming age-prediction model that would identify when an account belongs to a minor and automatically roll out teen safeguards.

Compared with adult users, the models are subject to stricter rules when a teenager is using them. Models are instructed to avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and first-person sexual or violent roleplay, even when it’s non-graphic. The specification also calls for extra caution around subjects like body image and disordered eating behaviors, and instructs the models to prioritize communicating about safety over autonomy when harm is involved and avoid advice that would help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers.

OpenAI specifies that these limits should hold even when prompts are framed as “fictional, hypothetical, historical, or educational” — common tactics that rely on role-play or edge-case scenarios in order to get an AI model to deviate from its guidelines.

OpenAI says the key safety practices for teens are underpinned by four principles that guide the models’ approach:

The document also shares several examples of the chatbot explaining why it can’t “roleplay as your girlfriend” or “help with extreme appearance changes or risky shortcuts.”

Lily Li, a privacy and AI lawyer and founder of Metaverse Law, said it was encouraging to see OpenAI take steps to have its chatbot decline to engage in such behavior.

Explaining that one of the biggest complaints advocates and parents have about chatbots is that they relentlessly promote ongoing engagement in a way that can be addictive for teens, she said: “I am very happy to see OpenAI say, in some of these responses, we can’t answer your question. The more we see that, I think that would break the cycle that would lead to a lot of inappropriate conduct or self-harm.”

That said, examples are just that: cherry-picked instances of how OpenAI’s safety team would like the models to behave. Sycophancy, or an AI chatbot’s tendency to be overly agreeable with the user, has been listed as a prohibited behavior in previous versions of the Model Spec, but ChatGPT still engaged in that behavior anyway. That was particularly true with GPT-4o, a model that has been associated with several instances of what experts are calling “AI psychosis.”

Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting kids in the digital world, raised concerns about potential conflicts within the Model Spec’s under-18 guidelines. He highlighted tensions between safety-focused provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle, which directs models to address any topic regardless of sensitivity.

“We have to understand how the different parts of the spec fit together,” he said, noting that certain sections may push systems toward engagement over safety. His organization’s testing revealed that ChatGPT often mirrors users’ energy, sometimes resulting in responses that aren’t contextually appropriate or aligned with user safety, he said.

In the case of Adam Raine, a teenager who died by suicide after months of dialogue with ChatGPT, the chatbot engaged in such mirroring, their conversations show. That case also brought to light how OpenAI’s moderation API failed to prevent unsafe and harmful interactions despite flagging more than 1,000 instances of ChatGPT mentioning suicide and 377 messages containing self-harm content. But that wasn’t enough to stop Adam from continuing his conversations with ChatGPT.

In an interview with TechCrunch in September, former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler said this was because, historically, OpenAI had run classifiers (the automated systems that label and flag content) in bulk after the fact, not in real time, so they didn’t properly gate the user’s interaction with ChatGPT.

OpenAI now uses automated classifiers to assess text, image, and audio content in real time, according to the firm’s updated parental controls document. The systems are designed to detect and block content related to child sexual abuse material, filter sensitive topics, and identify self-harm. If the system flags a prompt that suggests a serious safety concern, a small team of trained people will review the flagged content to determine if there are signs of “acute distress,” and may notify a parent.

Torney applauded OpenAI’s recent steps toward safety, including its transparency in publishing guidelines for users under 18 years old.

“Not all companies are publishing their policy guidelines in the same way,” Torney said, pointing to Meta’s leaked guidelines, which showed that the firm let its chatbots engage in sensual and romantic conversations with children. “This is an example of the type of transparency that can support safety researchers and the general public in understanding how these models actually function and how they’re supposed to function.”

Ultimately, though, it is the actual behavior of an AI system that matters, Adler told TechCrunch on Thursday.

“I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words,” he said.

Put differently: What’s missing from this announcement is evidence that ChatGPT actually follows the guidelines set out in the Model Spec.

Experts say with these guidelines, OpenAI appears poised to get ahead of certain legislation, like California’s SB 243, a recently signed bill regulating AI companion chatbots that goes into effect in 2027.

The Model Spec’s new language language mirrors some of the law’s main requirements around prohibiting chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill also requires platforms to provide alerts every three hours to minors reminding them they are speaking to a chatbot, not a real person, and they should take a break.

When asked how often ChatGPT would remind teens that they’re talking to a chatbot and ask them to take a break, an OpenAI spokesperson did not share details, saying only that the company trains its models to represent themselves as AI and remind users of that, and that it implements break reminders during “long sessions.”

The company also shared two new AI literacy resources for parents and families. The tips include conversation starters and guidance to help parents talk to teens about what AI can and can’t do, build critical thinking, set healthy boundaries, and navigate sensitive topics.

Taken together, the documents formalize an approach that shares responsibility with caretakers: OpenAI spells out what the models should do, and offers families a framework for supervising how it’s used.

The focus on parental responsibility is notable because it mirrors Silicon Valley talking points. In its recommendations for federal AI regulation posted this week, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz suggested more disclosure requirements for child safety, rather than restrictive requirements, and weighted the onus more toward parental responsibility.

Several of OpenAI’s principles — safety-first when values conflict; nudging users toward real-world support; reinforcing that the chatbot isn’t a person — are being articulated as teen guardrails. But several adults have died by suicide and suffered life-threatening delusions, which invites an obvious follow-up: Should those defaults apply across the board, or does OpenAI see them as trade-offs it’s only willing to enforce when minors are involved?

An OpenAI spokesperson countered that the firm’s safety approach is designed to protect all users, saying the Model Spec is just one component of a multi-layered strategy.

Li says it has been a “bit of a wild west” so far regarding the legal requirements and tech companies’ intentions. But she feels laws like SB 243, which requires tech companies to disclose their safeguards publicly, will change the paradigm.

“The legal risks will show up now for companies if they advertise that they have these safeguards and mechanisms in place on their website, but then don’t follow through with incorporating these safeguards,” Li said. “Because then, from a plaintiff’s point of view, you’re not just looking at the standard litigation or legal complaints; you’re also looking at potential unfair, deceptive advertising complaints.”

            <h2>Circles of Epstein Hell</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/epstein-released-files-doj/685341/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent document and photograph releases from the ongoing investigation into the life of Jeffrey Epstein have produced little new information about his crimes, but they have filled out the ever-growing roster of his notable associates: Woody Allen, Larry Summers, Noam Chomsky, Donald Trump, and many more. The steady drip of investigative proceeds has brought about a remarkable degree of cross-partisan condemnation. Anyone who spent time with this evil person, the implication seems to be, must also be evil, and quite possibly in the same way that Epstein was evil. But though association with Epstein is certainly worthy of scrutiny, not everyone in his network is guilty of participation in his abusive sexual enterprise—or necessarily guilty at all.

The entire Epstein story is hellish from top to bottom, an almost-Gothic tale of the appalling deference society pays to the rich and powerful. At the lowest rung of this inferno is Epstein himself, always amused or impassive in photographs, a blithe and shallow cipher of a man. His main hobbies appear to have been defrauding people and having sex, which is empty and fleeting enough in its own right. But his fixation on minors meant that the objects of his desire were always slipping away as time conveyed them past the point of his interest, and the fact that he offended so consistently for so many years suggests that he was indeed never satisfied, but was rather driven by a malevolent lust. He was a pedophile, a scoundrel, and a coward.

Accordingly, what emerges from the paper trail of Epstein’s life is not a portrait of deep friendships, but a web of transactional, superficial relationships, designed for mutual enablement. It appears that there was no one in his life with whom he was vulnerable or honest; even his interactions with his closest confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, read as generally businesslike. Maxwell was his procuress at the very least, and, according to victims’ testimony, was sometimes an active participant in sexual abuse herself.

Read: Virginia Giuffre’s family was shocked that Trump described her as ‘stolen’

Anyone who directly facilitated Epstein’s abuse—and there were apparently many such people beyond Maxwell—or participated in sexual exploitation themselves belongs on the same rung as Epstein; by their own deeds are they condemned, not simply by association. Britain’s former Prince Andrew, for instance, stands accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17 years old. (He has vigorously denied these allegations.) Where Trump fits into this picture is an open question and the subject of furious debate. Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or engagement in Epstein’s illicit sexual activities, and has claimed that he was not in touch with him after the early 2000s.

On the next rung are those among Epstein’s massive network of associates who knew about his sex crimes or suspected something was amiss, but decided that whatever was happening was none of their business, or that it wasn’t their problem, or that it wasn’t their place to intervene, or that interfering would frustrate the transactional opportunities that had brought them into Epstein’s world in the first place. Contained in this group are scores of people who seem mainly to have been interested in ingratiating themselves with Epstein in hopes that he would grant them large sums of money for their various projects, or that his putative financial acumen could make them even richer (though in many cases Epstein was instead scamming them). These people can be distinguished from the prior set by the fact that they themselves neither committed sex crimes nor aided Epstein in doing so. Though, to the degree that Epstein used these relationships to insulate himself from the consequences of his crimes so that he could continue to offend, they are something like accessories after the fact.

In the furthermost reaches of Epstein’s orbit there are people who seem genuinely not to have known about his criminal activity, and who are therefore the least guilty of all of his associates. Consider, for example, Princess Sofia of Sweden, who met with Epstein on several occasions in social settings 20 years ago, when she was a 21-year-old swimsuit model. Epstein’s emails show that Barbro Ehnbom, a Swedish business executive, had effected an email introduction between Epstein and Sofia, sending along a picture of the future princess. Epstein replied with interest, and offered to send her a ticket to visit him in the Caribbean. The role she played in the exchange seems more analogous to the experience of some of Epstein’s victims than his accomplices, in that she was a young and beautiful woman presented to Epstein by a wealthy friend and then invited to an island in the Caribbean. (The Swedish royal palace has stated that Sofia declined the invitation.) Given that context, it seems perfectly plausible that Sofia was not responsible for any crime or for any effort to shield Epstein from accountability. Nevertheless, her reputation has been tarnished by the Epstein affair, which brings with it a strong presupposition of sexual depravity. Again, there is no reason to believe that the princess did anything especially wrong. Her case appears to be a genuine instance of guilt by association, because it seems she is guilty of nothing more than some minor failure of prudence, meaning that she ought to have been more careful with her company.

Read: Epstein returns at the worst time for Trump

But many of those moneyed and prestigious Epstein orbiters innocent of sex crimes may be implicated in another category of offense: conspiracy to hoard and entrench wealth. The Epstein affair has produced evidence confirming that many of the people who control society’s wealth, politics, and prestige move in the same small circles, and may work together in private to make consequential decisions about the movement of money through society. This is hugely demoralizing; in a recent NBC poll, 54 percent of Americans now agree that “when it comes to politics and society, nothing really matters because powerful people will always do whatever they want.” They have ample reason for thinking so. It’s hard to imagine how the Epstein narrative could ever conclusively end, because it has also triggered a legitimation crisis.

Evil often presents a front of sophistication and implies a great deal of depth, when in fact it is almost always pathetic, stupid, and meaningless. Epstein was connected to some of the world’s most significant figures and had apparently unlimited resources at his fingertips, but his life seems to have amounted to very little. That is perhaps why one category of Epstein associate appears to have no known members: real and true friends, Ghislaine’s superficial closeness to him notwithstanding. Was there anyone Epstein bared his soul to, anyone he cared for beyond their practical use to him, or anyone who saw underneath his slick veneer, if there was anything there to see? This would be a more morally defensible group than his existing crop of allies, because complete isolation from human relationships is never a just penalty (which, among other reasons, is why solitary confinement is a fundamentally inhumane practice: Even the wicked are due a friend or two, supposing they can win them and keep them). And, insofar as those relationships can serve as a kind of tether to the moral community, cutting them off could conceivably be counterproductive. But all of that is likely beside the point, because no such person is evinced in the known fragments of Epstein’s life. He was little more than a hungry ghost.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books.

Venice is a city so globally famous that even those who have never been there tend to hold opinions about it. In my experience, those are frequently negative: It’s too expensive, too hot, too crowded with tourists. Calling it overrated has almost become a cliché; people love to remind one another that it’s sinking—fast. At the same time, few places have had as strong, or as enduring, a hold on the artistic imagination. John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Isabella Stewart Gardner, among many others, have long been inspired by Venice’s rich cultural history and captivating views.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Henry James was part of that group. He visited Venice 10 times between 1869 and 1907, and made it the setting of his 1888 novella The Aspern Papers, which was serialized in The Atlantic. The book’s narrator goes to Italy on a hunt for letters by the late poet Jeffrey Aspern to a former lover, Juliana, which he believes the now-elderly lady has secreted away in her palazzo. This year, we sent Anne Applebaum on a related quest: She showed up in Italy searching for the city James got to know—the Venice that inspired a substantial part of his work.

James’s Venice doesn’t dwell among oppressive crowds and opulent halls; it lurks in deserted squares, on less-traveled islands, and within cool, dark churches that hold Renaissance masterpieces. Venice was already becoming a tourist hot spot when James was alive, but he gloried in another city, and that city still exists. Even now, “if you take an odd turn down a narrow pathway and head away from the main attractions,” Applebaum writes, “the crowds thin out, and eventually you can find yourself quite alone.” James wrote appealingly about exploring the city’s “campos—the little squares formed about every church—some of them most sunnily desolate, the most grass-grown, the most cheerfully sad little reliquaries of a splendid past that you can imagine.”

Applebaum’s trip helped me think of Venice differently. She enjoyed the same “perfect light” on the island of Torcello that James saw, the same gold mosaic that covers one wall of the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta; she even walked through the same palazzo on which James modeled the one in The Aspern Papers. She stood on the balcony of the Palazzo Barbaro, another house where James frequently stayed, looking out at the Grand Canal just as the author did almost 150 years ago. If you know where to look, she argues, and if you take the time to do so, the old Venice is always there.

In James’s The Aspern Papers, an American uses “duplicity” to access a palazzo. Fortunately, there are easier ways to discover the writer’s beloved Venice.

This novel is so packed with plot that Quentin Tarantino adapted it into the extra-long film Jackie Brown, in 1997. If you’ve seen the movie, you might imagine Pam Grier sauntering across the page, but this is a breakneck novel in its own right: Characters make and shatter alliances at dizzying speed, and nobody’s motives are ever quite what they seem. A middle-aged flight attendant, Jackie Burke, finds herself trapped between the FBI and an ambitious gunrunner when she gets caught moving his merchandise across international borders. Shoot-outs, sting operations, and boatloads of blow: This book has it all. It’s a terrific beach read, but it has enough substance to keep you sustained no matter where you pick it up.  — M. L. Rio

From our list: Eight plot-heavy books that will keep you turning pages

A Daring New Take on Shakespeare’s Most Famous Soliloquy

The “To be, or not to be” soliloquy sets a particularly tricky trap. On-screen, the speech’s prestige can overwhelm its existential subject matter, and the passage tends to get overacted. “Because it’s a beautiful speech,” Peter Kirwan, a professor of Shakespeare and performance at Mary Baldwin University, told me, “the beauty of the speech kind of takes away from what it actually means for someone to be working through this.” The fact that any soliloquy halts dramatic action also poses a challenge. Onstage, an actor can naturally hold an audience’s attention, being in the same physical venue. Cinema’s visual language, though, has the potential to undermine the words’ meaning. The sentiment can become a spectacle more than an interior reflection made exterior.

I can, you can, but the usual idiots cannot. In actual reality, the LLM approach is a dead end, because it cannot be improved beyond a pretty low level of quality. There may (or may not) be long-term applications for specialist LLMs, but even that looks less and less likely. Agents based on LLMs? Pure hallucinations that they will ever be secure or reliable.

Only by the addicted.

Hopefully their well-deserved end is not that far off. They are nothing but a force of the negative.

I can assure you that the average person will NOT pay the monthly fee required to earn back that investment. Can Microsoft&#39;s stockholders tolerate hundreds of billions in losses?

Oracle investors don&#39;t seem to be able to tolerate it. Oracle stock is currently down ~42% from their big-AI-spending-announcement high. That was only 3 months ago.

Good question. Nobody on the customer side has any real business case that could ever justify that. On the other hand, we have too many ossified big tech companies (no, &quot;AI&quot; is not fixing that, it makes things worse), so Microsoft dying or Oracle collapsing would be entirely good things.

Wouldn&#39;t it be funny if all of these companies that are trying to out AI each other all go bankrupt in the arms race.

It would also be good for progress. Lets hope it happens soon.

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Energy (DOE) has a Christmas gift for the AI industry in the shape of agreements for collaboration in the Trump administration&#39;s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to drive scientific discoveries.

On Thursday, the DOE said it had signed agreements with 24 organizations interested in working to advance the Genesis project.

The list includes the usual AI ecosystem suspects, with developers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI; major cloud operators AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle; server makers Dell and HPE; chip suppliers AMD, Intel, and Nvidia; plus everyone&#39;s favorite Bond villain organization, Palantir.

However, the agreements are not contracts to provide services as such, but are described by the DOE as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with organizations that have either expressed interest in response to a Request for Information (RFI), or which already have active projects with DOE and its National Laboratories for activities related to the Genesis Mission.

&quot;These agreements help advance President Trump&#39;s Executive Order to build the national AI platform for scientific discovery and uplift the entire US R&D ecosystem,&quot; said Genesis Mission director and DOE Under Secretary for Science Dr Darío Gil.

The Genesis project was kick-started just last month via an executive order issued by President Trump. It aims to create an integrated Science and Security Platform for the US by pulling together supercomputers and other resources across the DOE&#39;s 17 National Laboratories and supplementing this with input from industry and academia.

Earlier this month, the agency announced $320 million in funding for four initiatives as part of the project, including the American Science Cloud (AmSC) as the infrastructure platform for Genesis, the Transformational AI Models Consortium (ModCon) to work on model development, and various projects to curate existing datasets and develop AI models validated for scientific applications.

So-called neocloud firm CoreWeave is also among the signatories with the DOE, and the rent-a-GPU biz said that it plans to make its purpose-built AI cloud platform available to support advanced scientific workloads.

CoreWeave chief exec Michael Intrator said Genesis &quot;represents a vital national commitment to accelerating scientific discovery and reaffirming America&#39;s leadership in research and innovation.&quot;

Consultants McKinsey & Company recently opined that neoclouds such as CoreWeave needed to adapt their business model to offering services built on their AI infrastructure rather than just renting GPU time, and Genesis may prove just such an opportunity.

Google&#39;s DeepMind subsidiary is set to make available its frontier AI for Science models and agentic tools to scientists at the DOE National Laboratories, starting with AI co-scientist on Google Cloud, it declared.

This it described as a &quot;multi-agent virtual scientific collaborator built on Gemini,&quot; which has been trained using Google&#39;s cloud-based TPU AI chips.

OpenAI said that the agreement builds on its existing work with DOE&#39;s National Laboratories, and creates a path for the parties to discuss and develop potential follow-on agreements as specific projects take shape.

&quot;We&#39;re excited to collaborate with the Department of Energy and contribute to the Genesis Mission. When frontier AI meets the expertise of the national labs, it opens up new ways to explore ideas, test them faster, and accelerate scientific progress,&quot; said Kevin Weil, OpenAI VP for Science. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/watchguard_firebox/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WatchGuard is in emergency patch mode after confirming that a critical remote code execution flaw in its Firebox firewalls is under active attack.

In an advisory published this week, the network security vendor warned customers that attackers are exploiting CVE-2025-32978, a 9.3-rated vulnerability affecting Firebox firewalls. The bug allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely, effectively handing over control of the firewall if the device is reachable over the internet.

WatchGuard said the bug resides in the Fireware OS Internet Key Exchange (IKE) service and can be exploited remotely, without authentication, to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Firebox devices. The vendor confirmed it has seen the flaw actively exploited in the wild and has released indicators of compromise to help customers assess whether they&#39;ve been hit.

&quot;This vulnerability affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer,&quot; WatchGuard said in a Thursday advisory. &quot;If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.&quot;

The immediate fix is to apply the latest firmware updates, which WatchGuard says fully address the vulnerability. For organizations unable to patch straight away, the vendor has provided a temporary workaround.

Firewalls and edge appliances have become a favorite target for attackers precisely because they sit at the boundary of enterprise networks and often run with high privileges. A successful exploit doesn&#39;t just compromise a single server; it can provide visibility into traffic, credentials, VPN connections, and downstream systems, all while hiding inside a box that many defenders implicitly trust.

Just days ago, Amazon disclosed a long-running espionage campaign it traced back to 2021, in which Russian GRU-linked attackers exploited CVE-2022-26318, an earlier critical unauthenticated RCE in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances, to execute arbitrary code via exposed management access.

That disclosure came just weeks after CISA added another critical WatchGuard Fireware OS flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-9242, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog after reports of active exploitation.

While WatchGuard has not linked the current exploitation to any specific threat actor, the pattern is now well established. Firewall vulnerabilities are rapidly weaponized, scanned for at scale, and chained with weak configurations to compromise networks before many organizations have time to react. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The University of Sydney is ringing around thousands of current and former staff and students after admitting attackers helped themselves to historical personal data stashed inside one of its online code repositories.

In a message published on December 18, the vice president of operations at the University of Sydney, Nicole Gower, said the university was alerted last week to &quot;suspicious activity in one of our online IT code libraries.&quot;

She said this had triggered an emergency lockdown of the system. While the repository was meant for software development, Gower acknowledged that &quot;there were also historical data files in this code library containing personal information about some members of our community.&quot;

The university was quick to stress that the incident was unrelated to a separate student results issue reported a day earlier and said there is currently no sign that the data has been misused.

According to an accompanying FAQ, the compromised system contained historical data extracts used for testing during earlier development work, rather than live production databases.

Officials said the unauthorized access was limited to a single platform and that other university systems were not affected. Even so, the files were accessed and downloaded, and the university has brought in external cybersecurity partners while notifying government authorities as the investigation continues into the new year.

The university estimates that the accessed data includes personal information for approximately 10,000 current staff and affiliates and around 12,500 former staff and affiliates active as of September 4, 2018. On top of that, historical datasets spanning 2010 to 2019 include records linked to roughly 5,000 alumni and students, as well as six supporters.

For staff linked to one of the retired systems involved in the incident, the exposed information may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, and basic employment details such as job titles and dates of employment. Gower confirmed that &quot;the data has been accessed and downloaded,&quot; while insisting there is &quot;no evidence it has been used or published.&quot;

The University of Sydney said it began sending notifications to affected individuals on December 18, though it warned that the process will drag into January 2026 as it finishes reviewing the files and checking contact details. The institution says it has purged the identified datasets from the code library and is assessing further remediation under its Privacy Resilience Program.

While the university maintains there is no evidence of harm so far, the episode is another reminder of how long-forgotten data can come back to bite. ®

Ready Player Me’s tech will help players ‘carry their identities and fandom’ across Netflix’s games.

As Netflix continues to build out its gaming strategy, which has recently included a new era of TV party games, it’s going to let people build avatars — with the help of a new acquisition. The company is acquiring avatar company Ready Player Me and its “cross-game avatar tech” to let players “carry their identities and fandom across games,” according to Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke.

Netflix “doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch” or which games will get them first, TechCrunch reports. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed.

Ready Player Me’s team of about 20 people will join Netflix. The company’s services, which “thousands” of developers used to “power cross-platform avatars,” will “become unavailable” on January 31st, 2026, Ready Player Me says on its website.

“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Tõke says. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I’m now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”

The energy demands of AI are driving investment in futuristic fusion reactors from Big Tech and now Trump Media. Is it viable?

Trump Media — yup, the parent company of Truth Social — is the latest entrant in the near century-long race to develop a nuclear fusion power plant. It announced a merger agreement with fusion company TAE Technologies on Thursday and a bold plan to break ground on the first utility-scale fusion plant some time in 2026.

TAE doesn’t plan to start generating power from its first plant until 2031, which is still an incredibly ambitious timeline. There will likely be a myriad of financial and regulatory issues to contend with along the way, of course. But the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome, which we’ll dive into here, are also enormous.

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies, and AI companies are salivating over it as a potential source of abundant electricity for data centers. But while a future fusion reactor might one day help solve some of humanity’s headaches, it could just be wishful thinking to expect them to come to the rescue for data centers anytime soon.

With fusion, scientists are trying to replicate the way stars create light and heat — atomic nuclei fuse together, generating a tremendous amount of energy. A fusion power plant could avoid the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are causing climate change, as well as the radioactive waste that today’s nuclear fission reactors create by splitting atoms apart to produce energy.

President Donald Trump has made his disdain for clean energy clear by falsely calling climate change a “con job,” ending tax incentives for renewables, and halting federal funding and permitting for solar and wind projects. But he has aligned himself with the tech broligarchy in trying to rush the development of new AI data centers. How to power these energy-hungry facilities has become a major hurdle for the industry, provoking pushback from communities across the US concerned about new data centers potentially driving up electricity rates and pollution.

Big names in tech are funneling money into fusion in the hopes that it might become a silver bullet for everyone’s energy woes. Google and Microsoft have announced agreements to purchase electricity from fusion power plants that other companies plan to complete by the late 2020s or 2030s. Sam Altman, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos have also backed startups developing their own fusion technologies.

“Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s — an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base, and bolster national defense,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media Chairman and CEO, said on a Thursday investor call.

There are no utility scale nuclear fusion power plants yet, despite the rush of initiatives to design one that might actually work. Success still depends on researchers solving significant scientific and engineering unknowns that they’ve been plugging away at for decades.

How do we know TAE and Trump Media can actually make fusion power plants a reality?

We don’t. As you can imagine, re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult. It takes an enormous amount of energy just to kick off a fusion reaction. A stumbling block scientists have faced for decades — and still face — is how to achieve a net energy gain from a fusion reaction.

The first time anyone in the world was able to achieve that net energy gain, often referred to as “ignition,” was in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). No other group, including TAE, has yet been able to do this with their own technology.

The 2022 breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore was achieved by firing 192 laser beams at a diamond-encased pellet of fuel. It’s a form of inertial confinement, triggering a fusion reaction by compressing and heating a fuel-filled target. Another competing fusion technology is called a tokamak, which uses magnetic fields to confine plasma and trigger the reaction.

Re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult

You can think of the reactor TAE is developing as a kind of a hybrid of both strategies, using what’s called field-reversed configuration (FRC). It still uses magnetic fields to lock plasma into place and also shoots beams of fuel directly into the plasma to stabilize it and create the conditions necessary for a reaction to occur.

So when are we going to have electricity from nuclear fusion?

Most experts The Verge has talked to over the years have been cautious to put a date on when a commercial fusion power plant could actually start powering homes and businesses.

Not only does TAE still have to demonstrate that it can achieve a net energy gain — that gain has to be big enough to make economic sense. The Lawrence Livermore breakthrough, for example, achieved a net energy gain of 1.5 megajoule gain (the experiment yielded 3.15 megajoules of energy compared to the 2.05 megajoules the lasers used to trigger the fusion reaction). A laser fusion power plant would likely need to achieve a gain of 50 to 100. The lab has repeated its experiments to work to get higher gains — reaching a record gain of 4.13 MJ in April of this year.

That’s all to say that there are still a lot of milestones for the industry to reach. The Trump administration released a roadmap in October for the advancement of fusion technologies, and the Department of Energy has set a goal of deploying commercial-scale fusion power to electricity grids by the mid-2030s.

“We’re really at kind of that first-of-kind technology innovation, and it’s kind of hard to assign direct timelines to these things,” says Patrick White, group lead for fusion energy safety and regulation at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF).

Commercial fusion reactors would also need robust supply chains for fuel and materials strong enough to withstand the extreme pressure and temperatures necessary for nuclear fusion. In short, designing a working reactor would be an enormous step forward — but then comes more difficult work to build the infrastructure and business around it.

The biggest impact this merger is likely to have — if it ultimately goes through — is to infuse a lot more cash into TAE’s ambitions.

TAE, founded in 1998, claims that its research has advanced enough to the point that “capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer said on the investor call.

Trump Media has agreed to shell out $300 million to TAE as part of the transaction. That adds to the more than $1.3 billion in private capital that TAE says it has raised to date from Google (TAE has been partnering with Google since 2014 to incorporate machine learning into its research), Chevron Technology Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and others.

With that money, TAE says it’ll be able to start construction on its first utility-scale fusion plant by the end of 2026 and generate “first power” in 2031. The first plant is supposed to have a capacity of 50MWe, similar to a fission microreactor. TAE didn’t immediately respond to questions from The Verge about where that facility would be located and how much it would cost. But the company’s already planning to build more fusion plants after that with a capacity reaching up to 500MWe.

Those plans are also contingent on regulatory approvals. But in a controversial decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that was codified by Congress this year, fusion reactors are regulated as particle accelerators in the US, similar to equipment used in cancer therapies and to sterilize medical equipment. That allows fusion plants to bypass lengthy federal licensing requirements that apply to fission reactors.

TAE has developed five iterations of its fusion reactor design and said as recently as April that it planned to unveil its sixth, called Copernicus, “before the end of the decade.” From there, it would work toward developing the company’s first prototype power plant, Da Vinci, “in the early 2030s.”

Then in November, TAE announced that it’s now leapfrogging over Copernicus and moving straight to Da Vinci. That’s a result of its latest fusion research reactor, Norm, being small and efficient enough to shave down costs by up to 50 percent, according to TAE.

“Norm is such a tremendous breakthrough that it renders Copernicus unnecessary — saving us considerable time and cost,” Binderbauer said in a November press release.

But it’ll still be resource-intensive for TAE to take the next leap in its reactor design. “As [TAE starts] looking at either building a scientific demonstration machine or going straight to a commercial prototype, those types of machines take a substantial amount of investment,” CATF’s White says. “And this [merger] potentially is going to be a pathway for them to receive the capital they need to actually start testing and deploying their fusion technology.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Whether your giftee is a fan of Metroidvanias or simply can’t get enough of Wes Anderson movies, we’ve got you covered.

Whether your giftee is a fan of Metroidvanias or simply can’t get enough of Wes Anderson movies, we’ve got you covered.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Most of us in the Northern Hemisphere spend the holidays indoors, but you can only watch so many TikToks about cute cats and cooking hacks before the need for something a little more substantive kicks in. Choosing the right game or movie to gift is tough, though, especially if you don’t have an exact read on what your friends and family like. And if you choose poorly, remember that you might also be on the hook to play or watch it with them.

That’s why, this year, we made it our mission to find gifts that appeal to people with diverse interests across a wide price range. If you know a Wes Anderson devotee, Criterion’s lavish box set is a great option to consider. We also have plenty of video game recs — from GOTY winner Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the notoriously brutal Silksong — along with a raft of suggestions when it comes to tabletop books, toys, and other pieces of hardware.

Anyone interested in the history of video games can learn a lot from The Console Chronicles, which covers every system from the Magnavox Odyssey (1972) to the Nintendo Switch (2017). The book is organized by generation, allowing you to see how a specific company’s hardware evolved or gain a sense of what all the major players were doing during any given time period.

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

Govee’s Sync Box 2 is a two-piece lighting kit that consists of a color-changing light strip and a breakout box with four HDMI 2.1 ports, which can pass up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz. The strip changes color in real time based on what you’re watching or playing, making it a great way to add some AI-generated pizzazz to your home theater setup.

Wes Anderson’s directing style is so distinct that it’s spawned a series of books dedicated to its aesthetic. The Wes Anderson Archive collects all of his films from Bottle Rocket through The French Dispatch in a single box set. The 20-disc trove includes every film on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray, plus more than 25 hours of special features and 10 illustrated booklets containing essays and interviews.

There are alternatives that don’t cost nearly as much as the One, but Xreal’s glasses offer some of the best performance you can get in a pair of AR shades. They connect to your phone and some handheld gaming PCs via USB-C, and once connected, you can use them as an external monitor for gaming or watching movies.

Perfect for the friend who games on iPhone and streams on repeat, Apple Gift Card is the ultimate entertainment upgrade. It can be used for App Store greats, in-app purchases, and your favorite subscription services, making it a flexible pick for anyone who loves their screen time.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 breaks the mold of classic RPGs. The story is just as grandiose and gripping as the best Final Fantasy games, but by allowing you to dodge and parry every enemy attack, it flips more traditional turn-based combat on its head. Then there’s the score and visually striking world, both of which are just as refreshing to behold.

The Backbone Pro might be the most flexible controller out there. Like prior models, the USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad over Bluetooth.

Thanks to an excellent combo of power and portability, Asus’ latest ROG Zephyrus G14 is the gaming laptop to beat. It’s thin and light enough to shove in a backpack, yet powerful enough to tackle modern games at the highest settings. Its 14-inch, 120Hz OLED screen is fast and easy on the eyes, too, making it a great everyday laptop.

Sucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima is everything you could want in a sequel. The open-world revenge epic brims with fluid combat and a host of welcome narrative twists, all set against the gorgeous backdrop of Japan’s Edo period. It’s precisely the type of game photo modes were made for, even if you never use them.

The first 15 Godzilla films, initially released between 1954 and 1975, were once considered the gold standard for monster movies. If you haven’t seen them yet, Criterion has packaged them in a single Blu-ray set that’s loaded with special features, including interviews, audio commentary, and a 1986 documentary featuring archival making-of footage.

If you’re shopping for a console gamer, the Nintendo Switch 2 hits all the right marks. It boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Just don’t forget to grab a copy of Mario Kart World or the new Donkey Kong game to go with it.

Metroid Prime 4 is still a first-person adventure game like prior entries in the series, but this time around, bounty hunter Samus Aran is armed with a motorcycle and a slate of psychic powers. Not all of the new gameplay elements work, but Beyond is a fitting follow-up to what came before, with a lore-heavy story, great combat, and plenty of eerie exploration.

Streaming might be convenient, but 4K Blu-ray discs offer far more detail thanks to their lack of compression. Panasonic’s DP-UB420 lets you tap into a vast catalog of Blu-ray titles with support for HDR10 Plus, HLG HDR, and uncompressed DSD audio. It also supports a bevy of streaming apps, as well as both Alexa and Google Assistant.

Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most lauded Metroidvanias of all time. It’s an unrelenting game that requires patience, often requiring you to replay sections in an effort to learn how to defeat a boss or avoid a pesky hazard. You may have to take breaks, but the beauty of Silksong is that it often inspires you to give tough sections “just one more try.”

If your old TV struggles to run streaming apps well (or at all), consider Onn’s 4K Streaming Device, which runs on Google TV. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and all your favorite apps, from Netflix and Disney Plus to YouTube. Recommendations are pulled from across services, and you can even use Google Assistant to search for shows and movies using your voice instead of the remote.

The AirFly Pro 2 can amp up the sound quality of in-flight entertainment, making it a handy tool for frequent travelers. The long-lasting Bluetooth adapter can sync with two pairs of wireless earbuds or headphones at once, allowing you and a partner to share a movie, a podcast, or music without relying on the subpar earbuds most airlines provide.

Final Fantasy Tactics may be a remake of a beloved classic, but that doesn’t mean your giftee needs to have played the original to enjoy the recent tactical RPG. The grid-based combat is terrific, the new voice acting is even more expressive, and the retooled UI is a welcome upgrade. You can even switch to a “classic version” that’s more faithful to the PlayStation original if you’re not a fan of the modern glow-up.

The G309 is an inexpensive, dual-mode wireless gaming mouse that punches well above its weight. It’s equipped with the same Hero 25K sensor and hybrid optomechanical switches found on pricier models, along with up to 600 hours of runtime over Bluetooth. It’s also the cheapest Powerplay mouse you can get, if you want to skip the whole charging thing altogether.

The irony of Blue Prince is that knowing as little as possible about it is what makes it great. The puzzle title’s central mystery plays second fiddle to the clever gameplay, which has you work your way through all 45 rooms in your uncle’s magical mansion, one architectural puzzle after another. Just be sure to keep an actual notebook nearby. You’re gonna need it.

I’m sorry, but Donkey Kong Bananza is the first killer exclusive for the Switch 2, not Mario Kart World. The game’s crowning achievement is its destructible environments, which you can crash and smash your way through as you collect gems. And don’t worry, you’ll still use DK’s fists to clock plenty of foes as you go.

The Mechanism Gaming Pillow helps gamers stay comfortable for hours on end. Made from soft, high-performance Lycra, it holds tech up so their arms don’t have to, letting them play longer without arm strain. It also comes with a mount to accommodate one of many gaming handhelds, from the Steam Deck and Switch 2 to the ROG Ally X.

The Quest 3S is the best VR headset for most people, full stop. It can tap into a large library of games on its own — including Resident Evil 4, Beat Saber, and the excellent Batman: Arkham Shadow — or you can pair it with a more powerful gaming PC, significantly expanding the number of plausible VR titles.

Piggyback’s insightful Metroid retrospective is a 210-page hardcover book full of concept art from the venerable GameCube and Wii trilogy, as well as notes from producer Kensuke Tanabe. The thoughtful (but candid) notes offer a behind-the-scenes look at each game’s development, including the frequent tension between Retro Studios and Nintendo.

Marathon gaming sessions are less fun when your wrists hurt. The Asus ROG Falcata is a compact, ergonomic split keyboard with an ultrafast polling rate that also lets you adjust the actuation point of each Hall effect key by as little as a hundredth of a millimeter. It connects over USB-C, or wirelessly via Bluetooth or the included 2.4GHz adapter.

Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the first game in the main series with a real-time battling system instead of the traditional turn-based formula. You’re still catching pokémon, leveling up, trading, and battling in the game’s Paris-inspired setting, but the more action-oriented battles and smooth performance (on the Nintendo Switch 2) are very welcome.

Half the fun of online gaming is being able to coordinate your strategy — well, that and (lightly) dunking on your friends. Sony’s latest InZone headset boasts some of the same hardware as the company’s stellar XM6 headphones, meaning you’re getting fantastic ANC in addition to a wealth of refined, gamer-centric features.

Lego and Nintendo partner quite often, but the Soda Jungle Maker Set is probably one of their more unique collabs in recent memory. The 598-piece kit features iconic baddies from the Super Mario games instead of Nintendo’s titular Italian plumber, allowing a Shy Guy, Piranha Plant, and Wiggler to take center stage for once.

The newest Tony Hawk remake offers improved graphics, better controls, more skaters, and the ability to customize goals via an in-game course creator. THPS4 even features two-minute goals in the style of the first three entries, rather than the open-ended nature of the original, resulting in a best-of-both-worlds situation.

If you subscribe to Apple Arcade, an Apple TV 4K can effectively double as both a mini gaming console and one of the best streaming devices you can buy. With it, you can connect a Bluetooth controller like the PlayStation 5’s DualSense, thus allowing games that were initially developed for PC / consoles to be played on the big screen for which they were designed.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
